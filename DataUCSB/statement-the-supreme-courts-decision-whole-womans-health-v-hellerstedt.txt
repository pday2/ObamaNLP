I am pleased to see the Supreme Court protect womens rights and health today. As the brief filed by the Solicitor General makes clear and as the Court affirmed today, these restrictions harm womens health and place an unconstitutional obstacle in the path of a womans reproductive freedom. We remain strongly committed to the protection of womens health, including protecting a womans access to safe, affordable health care and her right to determine her own future. Womens opportunities are expanded and our Nation is stronger when all of our citizens have accessible, affordable health care.

Obama Unveils Initiative

To Boost Community Colleges

President Barack Obama announced a 10-year, $12 billion community-college initiative designed to boost graduation rates, improve facilities and develop new technology.

Speaking in Warren, Mich., a blue-collar Detroit suburb, Mr. Obama framed the initiative as an opportunity to change the face of Rust Belt states that have traditionally relied heavily on unskilled labor.

The effort marks an increase in direct federal spending on community colleges. A report by the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank, estimated the federal government provides community colleges with $2 billion a year in direct support, a tenth of what it spends on public-four year schools. Administration officials said they plan to fund the initiative with savings from proposed changes in the student-loan program.

Democratic Rep. George Miller, chairman of the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee, is expected to introduce legislation Wednesday backing Mr. Obama's proposal to eliminate private lenders from the federal loan program and make the government the sole provider of such loans.

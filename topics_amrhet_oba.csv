Now, today, children enrolled excellent programs. children enrolled mediocre programs. wasting away formative years bad programs. includes one-fourth children Hispanic, drive America's workforce tomorrow, likely enrolled early childhood education program else.

We're going talk economy today. telling DeGioia slightly longer speech give, it's slightly bigger topic, going deal economic challenges. know, it's 12 weeks administration began. think critics agree least, we've busy. months, we've responded extraordinary set economic challenges extraordinary action -- action that's unprecedented terms scale speed. know accused taking once. believe haven't enough. Americans simply wondering programs policies fit single, overarching strategy economy recession recovery ultimately prosperity. today, want step moment explain strategy clearly can. going prose, poetry. want talk we've done, we've it, left do. want update progress we've made, want honest pitfalls lie ahead. all, want American know action policy pursue driven larger vision America's future -- future sustained economic growth creates jobs rising incomes; future prosperity fueled excessive debt, reckless speculation, fleeting profits, built skilled, productive workers, sound investments spread opportunity home allow nation lead world technologies innovation discoveries shape 21st century. That's America see. That's America Georgetown preparing for. future know have. Now, understand there, need understand here. Recessions uncommon. Markets economies naturally ebb flow, we've seen times history. recession different. recession caused normal downturn business cycle. caused perfect storm irresponsibility poor decision-making stretched Wall Street Washington Street. widely reported, started housing market. course decade, formula buying house changed: saving pennies buy dream house, Americans suddenly loans traditional standards incomes support. tricked signing subprime loans lenders trying quick profit. reason loans readily Wall Street saw big profits made. Investment banks buy package questionable mortgages securities, arguing pooling mortgages risks reduced. credit agencies supposed help investors determine soundness investments stamped securities safest rating labeled ""Buyer Beware."" knew actual value securities were, fully understood risks were. housing market booming prices rising, banks investors kept buying selling them, passing risk greater profit ultimate responsibility. Banks took debt handle. government-chartered companies Fannie Mae Freddie Mac, traditional mandate help support traditional mortgages, decided action buying holding billions dollars securities. AIG, biggest insurer world traditional insurance business profitable, decided profits suddenly selling billions dollars complicated financial instruments supposedly insured securities. making record profits -- wealth created real paper. bubble grew, accountability oversight Washington. housing bubble burst. Home prices fell. People began default subprime mortgages. value loans securities plummeted. Banks investors couldn't buy them. Greed gave way fear. Investors pulled money market. Large financial institutions didn't money hand pay obligations collapsed. banks held tight money simply lending. Now, crisis spread Wall Street Street. all, ability loan finance purchase home car to, know well, college education. It's stores stock shelves, farms buy equipment, businesses payroll. banks lending money, businesses started laying workers. laid-off workers money spend, businesses forced lay workers. people couldn't car loan, bad situation auto companies worse. people couldn't home loans, crisis housing market deepened. infected securities traded worldwide nations weak regulations, recession soon global. nations can't afford buy goods, slows economy further. situation, spiral confronted day took office. urgent task clear away wreckage, repair damage economy, prevent larger collapse. problems face working feed vicious economic downturn, we've choice attack fronts economic crisis simultaneously. step fight severe shortage demand economy. Federal Reserve dramatically lowering rates year order boost investment. administration Congress boosted demand passing largest recovery plan nation's history. It's plan that's process saving creating 3.5 million jobs years. It's putting money directly people's pockets tax cut 95 percent working families that's showing paychecks America. cushion blow recession, extended unemployment benefits continued health care coverage Americans who've lost jobs fault own. Now, recall argued recovery plan case irresponsible government spending, it's blame long-term deficit projections, federal government cutting increasing spending right now. want tackle argument head on. begin with, economists left right agree government middle recession cut spending. see, recession began, families sat kitchen table tried figure cut back. businesses. completely reasonable understandable reaction. -- -- family America, business America cuts once, spending money, means customers, means layoffs, means economy worse. That's government step temporarily boost spending order stimulate demand. That's exactly we're right now. Second, absolutely agree long-term deficit major problem fix. recovery plan represents tiny fraction long-term deficit. I'll discuss moment, key dealing long-term deficit national debt handle out-of-control health care costs -- stand idly economy goes free fall. recovery plan step confronting economic crisis. second step heal financial credit flowing businesses families rely it. heart financial crisis banks financial institutions simply lending money. climate fear, banks unable replace losses bad mortgages raising new capital own, unwilling lend money afraid pay back. It's reason administration called Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, banks temporary financial assistance order lending again. Now, understand TARP popular, say don't agree ways TARP program managed, agree broader rationale banks capital confidence start lending again. That's purpose stress tests soon tell additional capital needed support lending largest banks. Ideally, needs met private investors willing money banks. that's possible, banks require substantial additional resources government, hold accountable responsible, we'll force adjustments, we'll support clean bank balance sheets, assure continuity strong viable institution serve people economy. course, differ approach. hand, argue government stand simply let banks fail -- especially cases bad decisions helped create crisis place. like not, history shown repeatedly nations early aggressive action credit flowing again, crises years years months months -- years low growth, years low job creation, years low investment, cost nations far course bold, upfront action. Americans understandably think government money spent going directly families businesses banks -- frequent questions letters constituents is, ""Where's bailout?"" -- understand sentiment. makes sense intuitively, morally makes sense, truth dollar capital bank actually result $8 $10 loans families businesses. that's multiplier effect ultimately lead faster pace economic growth. That's fix banks. Now, hand, don't dispute need shore banking system, suggest we've timid it. essentially nationalization argument heard. argument says federal government preemptively stepped taken major financial institutions way FDIC currently intervenes smaller banks, failure, administration's failure example Washington coddling Wall Street -- ""Why aren't tougher banks?"" let clear: reason taken step ideological political judgment we've government involvement banks. It's certainly concern management shareholders actions helped cause mess. Rather, it's believe preemptive government takeovers likely end costing taxpayers end, it's likely undermine create confidence. Governments practice principle doctors: First, harm. rest assured -- credit flowing again, ways minimize risks taxpayers broader economy. end, addition program capital banks, we've launched plan pair government resources private investment order clear away old loans securities -- so-called toxic assets -- preventing banks lending money. Now, we've learned crisis banks aren't institutions affected toxic assets clogging financial system. AIG, example, bank, it's insurance company, mentioned -- chose insure billions dollars worth risky assets, essentially creating hedge fund insurance company, failure threaten entire financial freeze lending more. that's why, frustrating -- promise you, frustrated AIG -- promise -- support AIG, entire system, fragile is, profoundly endangered AIG went liquidation bankruptcy. It's need new legal authority power intervene financial institutions, way bankruptcy courts currently businesses hit hard times don't pose systemic risks -- way restructure businesses orderly way doesn't induce panic financial -- and, way, allow restructure inappropriate bonus contracts creating perception government change compensation rules whim. we're moving aggressively unfreeze markets jumpstart lending banking system, half lending America actually takes place. this, we've started program increase guarantees small business loans unlock market auto loans student loans. stabilize housing market, we've launched plan save million responsible homeowners foreclosure help millions refinance homes. weeks, reassess state Chrysler General Motors, companies important place history large footprint economy -- companies fallen hard times. Late year, companies given transitional loans previous administration tide worked develop viable business plans. Unfortunately, plans developed fell short, we've given additional time work complex issues through. way, owed executives bad bets contributed weakening companies, hundreds thousands workers livelihoods hang balance -- entire towns, entire communities, entire states profoundly impacted happens auto industry. Now, fervent hope coming weeks, Chrysler viable partner GM develop business plan path profitability endless support American taxpayer. meantime, we're taking steps spur demand American cars relief autoworkers communities. continue reaffirm nation's commitment 21st-century American auto industry creates new jobs builds fuel-efficient cars trucks carry clean-energy future. Finally, coordinate global response global recession, went meeting G20 nations London week. nation undertaken significant stimulus spur demand. agreed pursue tougher regulatory reforms. agreed triple lending capacity International Monetary Fund -- which, know, international financial institution supported major economies -- direct assistance developing nations vulnerable populations. That's charity; America's success depends nations ability buy sell, it's important pay attention emerging markets. pledged avoid trade barriers protectionism hurts end. decided meet fall gauge progress additional steps necessary. that's we've been, that's we've months. actions -- Recovery Act, bank capitalization program, housing plan, strengthening non-bank credit market, auto plan, work G20 -- pieces recovery puzzle. They've designed increase aggregate demand credit flowing families businesses help families businesses ride storm. taken together, actions starting generate signs economic progress. recovery plan, schools police departments cancelled planned layoffs; clean energy companies construction companies re-hiring workers build energy-efficient windows new roads highways. housing plan helped lead spike number homeowners taking advantage historically-low mortgage rates refinancing, like putting $2,000 tax cut pocket. program support market auto loans student loans started unfreeze market securitize lending weeks. small businesses seeing jump loan activity time months. Now, welcome encouraging news. mean hard times over; 2009 continue difficult year America's economy, obviously, difficult who've lost jobs. severity recession cause job loss, foreclosures, pain ends. market continue rise fall. Credit flowing nearly easily should. process restructuring AIG auto companies involve difficult unpopular choices; finished front. means there's work done. means continue expect unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort administration fight economic recovery fronts. continue clear away wreckage address crisis, firm belief task, beginning now, sure crisis happens again. clean balance sheets credit flowing again, people start spending businesses start hiring -- that's going happen -- realize bubble-and-bust economy led point. simply sustainable 21st-century financial governed 20th-century rules regulations allowed recklessness threaten entire economy. sustainable economy year, 40 percent corporate profits came financial sector based inflated home prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks overvalued assets. It's sustainable economy incomes 1 percent skyrocketed typical working household seen incomes decline nearly $2,000. That's sustainable model long-term prosperity. chasing ever-bigger bonuses short-term profits decade, continued neglect long-term threats prosperity: crushing burden rising cost health care placing families businesses; failure education prepare workers new age; progress nations making clean energy industries technologies -- remain addicted foreign oil; growing debt we're passing children. emerge current recession, challenges represent major obstacles stand way success 21st century. we've work do. Now, there's parable end Sermon Mount tells story men. built house pile sand, soon destroyed storm hit. second known wise man, ""the rain descended, floods came, winds blew, beat house, fell not: founded rock."" founded rock. rebuild economy pile sand. build house rock. lay new foundation growth prosperity -- foundation era borrow spend save invest; consume home exports abroad. It's foundation built pillars grow economy new century American century: Number one, new rules Wall Street reward drive innovation, reckless risk-taking; number two, new investments education workforce skilled competitive; number three, new investments renewable energy technology create new jobs new industries; number four, new investments health care cut costs families businesses; number five, new savings federal budget bring debt future generations. That's new foundation build. That's house built rock. future -- administration's policies designed achieve future. Let talk steps turn. step build foundation reform outdated rules regulations allowed crisis happen place. time lay tough new rules road Wall Street ensure again. Great Depression new rules designed banks avoid kind reckless speculation helped create depression, we've adaptations current set rules: create rules punish shortcuts abuse; rules tie someone's pay actual job performance --- novel concept; rules protect typical American families buy home, credit card invest 401(k). we've begun work Congress shape comprehensive new regulatory framework -- expect arrive desk signature year out. second pillar new foundation education finally prepares workers 21st century economy. know, 20th century, G.I. helped generation college. decades led world educational attainment, consequence led world economic growth. new economy, we've come trail world's leaders graduation rates, educational achievement, production scientists engineers. That's set goal greatly enhance ability compete high-wage, high-tech jobs 21st century: 2020, America highest proportion college graduates world. goal set intend do. meet goal, start early. we've dramatically expanded early childhood education. investing innovative programs proven help schools meet high standards close achievement gaps. We're creating new rewards tie teachers' performance new pathways advancement. I've asked American commit year higher education career training, tax credits college education affordable American, attend Georgetown. And, way, changes like -- I'm going talking weeks come -- seeing best brightest commit making -- engineers, scientists, innovators. long, placed pinnacle folks manipulate numbers engage complex financial calculations. that's good, need that. know scientists engineers, building making export countries. Now, pillar new foundation harness renewable energy create millions new jobs new industries. know country harnesses new energy source lead 21st century. we've allowed countries outpace race future. don't know you, accept future jobs industries tomorrow root borders. think it's time America lead again. investments Recovery Act double nation's supply renewable energy years. putting Americans work making homes buildings efficient save billions energy bills grow economy time. Now, truly spark transformation that's need gradual, market-based cap carbon pollution, clean energy profitable kind energy. who've argued shouldn't attempt, shouldn't thinking, shouldn't talking transition economy recovers. right account costs transition. Transitioning clean energy economy easy. longer delay putting framework clean energy economy place. needs now. businesses entrepreneurs know today closing carbon pollution loophole, they'll start investing clean energy now. pretty soon, we'll companies constructing solar panels, workers building wind turbines, car companies manufacturing fuel-efficient cars. Investors money new energy technology, small business open start selling it. That's grow economy, enhance security, protect planet time. Now, fourth pillar new foundation 21st century health care families, businesses government budgets aren't dragged skyrocketing insurance premiums. half million Americans lose homes year medical crisis. Major American corporations struggling compete foreign counterparts. Small businesses closing doors. can't allow cost health care continue strangling economy. that's Recovery Act invest electronic health records strict privacy standards save money lives reduce medical error. That's we've largest investment preventive care, that's best ways costs control. included budgets passed Congress historic commitment reform finally quality health care affordable American. I'm looking forward months working parties Congress reform reality. -- done. Now, fixing health care -- require resources; it's going free. budget we've commitment fully pay reform increasing deficit, we've identified specific savings health care efficient reduce costs all. fact, we've undertaken unprecedented effort kind savings corner budget, final pillar building new foundation restoring fiscal discipline economy recovers. we've identified $2 trillion dollars deficit reductions decade. need more, we've that. We've announced procurement reform greatly reduce no-bid contracts save government $40 billion. need more, that's important start. Secretary Gates recently announced courageous set reforms right hundreds billions dollars waste cost overruns bloated defense budget making America safer. need more, proposal Secretary Gates right target. end education programs don't work, root waste fraud abuse Medicare program. Altogether, budget reduce discretionary spending domestic programs share economy 10 percent decade lowest level we've seen began keeping records nearly half century ago. continue federal budget line line, announcing additional savings, secured eliminating consolidating programs don't need room need. That's we're now. course, realize some, isn't enough. know there's criticism administration spending reckless abandon, pushing liberal social agenda mortgaging children's future. You've heard argument. Well, let points. First, earlier, worst recession severe try cut government spending time families businesses world cutting spending. deficit debt problems -- -- major efforts deal focus medium long-term budget picture, short-term. that's exactly we've done. Second, tackling deficit issue, simply sacrifice long-term investments desperately need generate long-term prosperity. That's argument critics made: Well, you're proposing health care reform, shouldn't that; you're proposing education investments, shouldn't that, adds deficit. Look, cash-strapped family cut kinds luxuries, insist spending money children college, refuse kids drop college work fast-food place, bring income short-term, they're thinking long term -- country current choices eye future. don't invest renewable energy, don't invest skilled workforce, don't invest affordable health care system, economy simply won't grow pace needs 10 years road. don't lay new foundation now, won't long we're right today. assure chronically slow growth help long-term budget situation. That's second point. point, problem deficit debt new. building dramatically past years, largely big tax cuts combined increased spending wars increased costs government health care programs pushed upwards. structural gap budget, money that's coming money that's going out, worse baby boomers age, lead unsustainable path. let's kid suggest solve problem trimming earmarks cutting budget National Endowment Arts. That's true. defense national debt, biggest cost drivers budget entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- expensive year. want fiscal discipline, do, we're going trim waste discretionary budget -- we've begun -- entitlement reform. Now, important goal passing health care reform brings costs system, including Medicare Medicaid. mistake, health care reform entitlement reform. That's opinion -- conclusion wide range participants Fiscal Responsibility Summit held White House February. that's reasons firmly believe need health care reform year. tackle rising health care costs, work Social Security firmer footing. It's time parties come way promise sound retirement future generations. restore sense fairness balance tax code including shutting corporate loopholes ensuring pays owe. efforts require tough choices. efforts require compromise. difficulties can't serve excuse inaction -- anymore -- brings final point I'd like today. I've talked fundamental weakness economy led day reckoning. arrived fundamental weakness political system. long, Washington hard decisions time day. There's tendency spend time scoring political points rolling sleeves solve real problems. There's impatience characterizes town -- attention span grown shorter 24-hour news cycle insists instant gratification form results higher poll numbers. crisis hits, there's lurch shock trance, responding tempest moment furor died down, media coverage moved else, confronting major challenges shape future sustained focused way. can't times. challenges great. stakes high. know difficult members Congress parties grapple big decisions face right now. I'd love problems coming time time. It's Congresses Presidents deal lifetime. called govern extraordinary times. requires extraordinary sense responsibility -- ourselves, men women here, generations lives affected ill here. doubt times tough. means woods yet. stand, time, we're beginning glimmers hope. that, way distance, vision America's future far troubled economic past.

That's argued closed campaign, ordered closed year. decision order review pending cases Guantanamo. knew ordered Guantanamo closed difficult complex. 240 people spent years legal limbo. dealing situation, don't luxury starting scratch. We're cleaning is, simply, mess -- misguided experiment left wake flood legal challenges administration forced deal constant, daily basis, consumes time government officials time spent protecting country. Indeed, legal challenges sparked debate recent weeks Washington taking place decided close Guantanamo. example, court order release 17 Uighurs -- 17 Uighur detainees took place fall, George Bush President. Supreme Court invalidated prosecution Guantanamo 2006 overwhelmingly appointed Republican Presidents -- wild-eyed liberals. words, problem Guantanamo detainees caused decision close facility; problem exists decision open Guantanamo place. let blunt. neat easy answers here. wish were. tell wrong answer pretend like problem away maintain unsustainable status quo. President, refuse allow problem fester. refuse pass else. responsibility solve problem. security interests permit delay. courts won't allow it. conscience. Now, weeks, we've seen return politicization issues characterized years. I'm elected official; understand problems arouse passions concerns. should. We're confronting complicated questions democracy face. spending time relitigating policies years. I'll leave others. want solve problems, want solve Americans. ill-served fear-mongering emerges discuss issue. Listening recent debate, I've heard words that, frankly, calculated scare people educate them; words politics protecting country. want opportunity lay doing, intend resolve outstanding issues. explain action taking help build framework protects American people values hold dear. I'll focus broad areas: first, issues relating Guantanamo detention policy; but, second, want discuss issues relating security transparency. Now, let begin disposing argument plainly can: going release endanger national security, release detainees United States endanger American people. demanded justice national security, seek transfer detainees type facilities hold manner dangerous violent criminals borders -- namely, highly secure prisons ensure public safety. decisions, bear mind following face: escaped federal, supermax prisons, hold hundreds convicted terrorists. Republican Lindsey Graham said, idea place securely house 250-plus detainees United States rational. currently process reviewing detainee cases Guantanamo determine policy dealing them. so, acutely aware administration, detainees released and, cases, returned battlefield. That's away poorly planned, haphazard approach let detainees past. treating cases care attention law requires security demands. Now, going forward, cases fall distinct categories. First, feasible, try violated American criminal laws federal courts -- courts United States Constitution. derided federal courts incapable handling trials terrorists. wrong. courts juries, citizens, tough convict terrorists. record makes clear. Ramzi Yousef tried blow World Trade Center. convicted courts serving life sentence U.S. prisons. Zacarias Moussaoui identified 20th 9/11 hijacker. convicted courts, serving life sentence prison. try terrorists courts hold prisons, detainees Guantanamo. Recently, prosecuted received guilty plea detainee, al-Marri, federal court years legal confusion. We're preparing transfer detainee Southern District Court New York, face trial charges 1998 bombings embassies Kenya Tanzania -- bombings killed 200 people. Preventing detainee coming shores prevent trial conviction. decade, time finally justice served, intend do. second category cases involves detainees violate laws war best tried military commissions. Military commissions history United States dating George Washington Revolutionary War. venue trying detainees violations laws war. allow protection sensitive sources methods intelligence-gathering; allow safety security participants; presentation evidence gathered battlefield effectively presented federal courts. Now, suggested represents reversal part. look record. 2006, strongly oppose legislation proposed Bush administration passed Congress failed establish legitimate legal framework, kind meaningful process rights accused stand appeal. time, however, supported military commissions try detainees, reforms, bipartisan efforts achieve reforms. reforms making. using flawed commissions years, administration bringing commissions line rule law. longer permit evidence -- evidence statements obtained using cruel, inhuman, degrading interrogation methods. longer place burden prove hearsay unreliable opponent hearsay. detainees greater latitude selecting counsel, protections refuse testify. reforms, others, military commissions credible effective means administering justice, work Congress members parties, legal authorities political spectrum, legislation ensure commissions fair, legitimate, effective. category detainees includes ordered released courts. Now, let repeat earlier: decision close Guantanamo. rule law. courts spoken. there's legitimate reason hold 21 people currently held Guantanamo. Nineteen findings took place sworn office. ignore rulings President, bound law. United States nation laws abide rulings. fourth category cases involves detainees determined transferred safely country. far, review team approved 50 detainees transfer. administration ongoing discussions number countries transfer detainees soil detention rehabilitation. Now, finally, remains detainees Guantanamo prosecuted pose clear danger American people. honest -- toughest single issue face. We're going exhaust avenue prosecute Guantanamo pose danger country. process complete, number people prosecuted past crimes, cases evidence tainted, nonetheless pose threat security United States. Examples threat include people who've received extensive explosives training Qaeda training camps, commanded Taliban troops battle, expressed allegiance Osama bin Laden, clear want kill Americans. people who, effect, remain war United States. Let repeat: going release individuals endanger American people. Qaeda terrorists affiliates war United States, capture -- like prisoners war -- prevented attacking again. that, recognize detention policies unbounded. can't based simply executive branch decide alone. That's administration begun reshape standards apply ensure line rule law. clear, defensible, lawful standards fall category. fair procedures don't mistakes. process periodic review, prolonged detention carefully evaluated justified. know creating poses unique challenges. countries grappled question; now, we. want clear goal construct legitimate legal framework remaining Guantanamo detainees transferred. goal avoid legitimate legal framework. constitutional system, prolonged detention decision man. determine United States hold individuals carrying act war, involves judicial congressional oversight. so, going forward, administration work Congress develop legal regime efforts consistent values Constitution. Now, efforts close Guantanamo forward, know politics Congress difficult. issues fodder 30-second commercials. picture direct mail pieces emerge vote issue -- designed frighten population. it. continue decisions climate fear, mistakes. refuse deal issues today, guarantee albatross efforts combat terrorism future. confidence American people interested right protect country political posturing. person city swore oath uphold Constitution -- member Congress. responsibility enlist values effort secure people, leave legacy makes easier future Presidents country safe. Now, let touch second set issues security transparency. National security requires delicate balance. hand, democracy depends transparency. hand, protected public disclosure sake security -- instance, movement troops, intelligence-gathering, terrorist organization affiliates. cases, lives stake. Now, weeks ago, ongoing court case, released memos issued previous administration's Office Legal Counsel. disagreed enhanced interrogation techniques memos authorized, didn't release documents rejected legal rationales -- counts. released memos existence approach interrogation widely known, Bush administration acknowledged existence, banned methods. argument releasing memos terrorists interrogated makes sense. interrogating terrorists using approach. approach prohibited. short, released memos overriding reason protect them. ensuing debate helped American people understand interrogation methods came authorized used. hand, recently opposed release photographs taken detainees U.S. personnel 2002 2004. Individuals violated standards behavior photos investigated held accountable. debate reflected photos wrong. concealed absolve perpetrators crimes. However, judgment -- informed national security team -- releasing photos inflame anti-American opinion allow enemies paint U.S. troops broad, damning, inaccurate brush, endangering theaters war. short, clear compelling reason release photos. nearly 200,000 Americans serving harm's way, solemn responsibility safety Commander-in-Chief. gained release photos matters lives young men women serving harm's way. Now, press's mind public's mind, cases contradictory. me. cases, strike right balance transparency national security. balance brings precious responsibility. There's doubt American people seen balance tested years. images Abu Ghraib brutal interrogation techniques public long President, American people learned actions taken bear resemblance ideals generations Americans fought for. run-up Iraq war revelation secret programs, Americans felt like story unnecessarily withheld them. caused suspicion build up. leads thirst accountability. understand that. ran promising transparency, meant said. that's why, possible, administration American people informed judgments hold accountable. argued -- -- sensitive national security matters simply open book. abandon -- vigorously defend -- necessity classification defend troops war, protect sources methods, safeguard confidential actions American people safe. Here's difference though: release public valid national security reasons, insist oversight actions -- Congress courts. We're currently launching review current policies agencies responsible classification documents determine reforms possible, assure branches government position review executive branch decisions matters. checks balances, watch watchers -- especially comes sensitive administration -- information. Now, lines, administration confronting challenges known ""state secrets"" privilege. doctrine allows government challenge legal cases involving secret programs. It's past Presidents -- Republican Democrat -- decades. principle absolutely circumstances protect national security, concerned over-used. currently subject wide range lawsuits. let lay principles here. protect merely reveals violation law embarrassment government. that's administration nearing completion review practice. plan embrace principles reform. apply stricter legal test material protected state secrets privilege. assert privilege court following formal process, including review Justice Department committee personal approval Attorney General. year voluntarily report Congress invoked privilege because, before, proper oversight actions. matters disclosure sensitive information, wish say simple formula had. not. involve tough calls, involve competing concerns, require surgical approach. common thread runs decisions simple: safeguard protect American people, ensure accountability oversight hallmark constitutional system. hide truth it's uncomfortable. deal Congress courts co-equal branches government. tell American people know don't know, release publicly secret, tell why. Now, areas I've discussed today, policies I've proposed represent new direction years. protect American people values, we've banned enhanced interrogation techniques. closing prison Guantanamo. reforming military commissions, pursue new legal regime detain terrorists. declassifying embracing oversight actions, we're narrowing state secrets privilege. dramatic changes approach national security surer, safer, sustainable footing. implementation time, done. There's core principle apply actions. clean mess Guantanamo, constantly reevaluate approach, subject decisions review branches government, public. seek strongest sustainable legal framework addressing issues long term -- serve politics, what's right long term. leave legacy outlasts administration, presidency, endures -- legacy protects American people enjoys broad legitimacy home abroad. Now, mean say need focus future. recognize strong desire focus past. comes actions years, passions high. Americans angry; want re-fight debates settled, cases debates lost. know debates lead directly, cases, fuller accounting, independent commission. I've opposed creation commission believe existing democratic institutions strong deliver accountability. Congress review abuses values, ongoing inquiries Congress matters like enhanced interrogation techniques. Department Justice courts work punish violations laws miscarriages justice. It's secret tendency Washington spend time pointing fingers another. it's secret media culture feeds impulse lead fight copy. contribute extended relitigation years. Already, we've seen kind effort leads Washington sides laying blame. distract focusing time, efforts, politics challenges future. that, all, recent debate -- recent debate obscured truth sends people opposite absolutist ends. spectrum, little allowance unique challenges posed terrorism, national security transparency. end spectrum, embrace view summarized words: ""Anything goes."" arguments suggest ends fighting terrorism justify means, blanket authority wants -- agree. sides views, right. American people absolutist, don't elect impose rigid ideology problems. know need sacrifice security values, sacrifice values security, long approach difficult questions honesty care dose common sense.

Let begin thanking Nancy wonderful introduction. want Dr. Joseph Heyman, chair Board Trustees, Dr. Jeremy Lazarus, speaker House Delegates. bringing home, it's day. moment took office President, central challenge we've confronted nation need lift worst recession World War II. recent months, we've taken series extraordinary steps, repair damage economy, build new foundation lasting sustained growth. We're create new jobs, unfreeze credit markets. We're stemming loss homes decline home values. important. we've progress, know road prosperity remains long remains difficult. know essential step journey control spiraling cost health care America. order that, we're going need help AMA. Today, spending $2 trillion year health care -- 50 percent person costly nation. yet, think aware, spending, citizens uninsured, quality care lower, aren't healthier. fact, citizens countries spend substantially actually living longer do. mistake: cost health care threat economy. It's escalating burden families businesses. It's ticking time bomb federal budget. unsustainable United States America. It's unsustainable Americans like Laura Klitzka, young mother met Wisconsin week, who's learned breast cancer thought she'd beaten spread bones, who's forced spend time worrying cover $50,000 medical debts she's accumulated, worried future debts she's going accumulate, wants spend time children focus well. worries woman like Laura face nation wealthy ours. Stories like Laura's told women men country -- families who've seen out-of-pocket costs soar, premiums double decade rate times faster wages. forcing Americans ages checkups prescriptions need -- know need. It's creating situation single illness wipe lifetime savings. costly health care unsustainable doctors like Michael Kahn New Hampshire, who, puts it, spends 20 percent day supervising staff explaining insurance problems patients, completing authorization forms, writing appeal letters -- routine calls disruptive distracting, giving time doctor actually care patients. Small business owners like Chris Becky Link Nashville struggling. They've wanted right workers family-run marketing firm, they've recently unthinkable lay number employees -- layoffs deferred, say, health care costs weren't high. country, one-third small businesses reduced benefits recent years one-third dropped workers' coverage altogether early '90s. largest companies suffering, well. big led General Motors Chrysler trouble recent decades huge costs racked health care workers -- costs profitable competitive automakers world. fix health care system, America way GM -- paying more, less, going broke. comes cost health care, then, status quo unsustainable. reform luxury; necessity. hear people say, well, taking right now, you've problems, reminding people I'd love able defer issues, can't. know there's discussion reform cost, rightly so. test -- Democrats Republicans alike -- holding line new spending restoring fiscal discipline. let doubt -- cost inaction greater. fail act -- fail act -- know individual practices -- fail act, premiums climb higher, benefits erode further, rolls uninsured swell include millions Americans -- affect practice. fail act, dollars earn spent health care decade. 30 years, -- trend mean lost jobs, lower take-home pay, shuttered businesses, lower standard living Americans. fail act, federal spending Medicaid Medicare grow coming decades equal government currently spends nation's defense. will, fact, eventually grow larger government spends today. It's scenario swamp federal state budgets, impose vicious choice unprecedented tax hikes, overwhelming deficits, drastic cuts federal state budgets. say plainly can, health care single important America's long-term fiscal health. fact. That's fact. It's fact, truth people know it's fact. yet, clear badly needs reform, reform inevitable. There's sense some, members gathered today AMA, bad current -- it's pretty bad -- devil know devil don't. There's fear change -- worry lose works health care trying fix doesn't. I'm tell understand fear. understand cynicism. They're scars left past efforts reform. all, Presidents called health care reform nearly century. Teddy Roosevelt called it. Harry Truman called it. Richard Nixon called it. Jimmy Carter called it. Clinton called it. significant individual reforms -- Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program -- efforts comprehensive reform covers brings costs largely failed. reason groups involved -- doctors, insurance companies, businesses, workers, -- simply couldn't agree need reform shape take. we're honest, reason fierce opposition fueled groups lobbyists -- opposition fear tactics paint effort achieve reform attempt to, yes, socialize medicine. long history failure, I'm standing think we're time. sign past week, Senate passed protect children dangers smoking, reform AMA long championed -- organization long championed; went proposed decade ago -- I'm going sign law. Now, makes moment time -- time -- key stakeholders aligning against, favor reform. They're coming -- they're coming recognition reform health care community -- going pitch -- ultimately, benefit. want commend AMA, particular, offering curb costs achieve reform. week ago, joined hospitals, labor unions, insurers, medical device manufacturers drug companies unthinkable years ago -- promised work cut national health care spending $2 trillion decade, relative been. bring costs; bring premiums. That's exactly kind cooperation need, appreciate much. you. Now, finish job? permanently bring costs quality, affordable health care single American? That's I've come talk today. know moment right health care reform. know historic opportunity we've seen again. know try scuttle opportunity matter -- scare tactics fear-mongering that's worked past; warnings socialized medicine government takeovers, long lines rationed care, decisions bureaucrats doctors. heard before. fear tactics worked, kept worse. let begin saying American people: know millions Americans content health care coverage -- like plan and, importantly, value relationship doctor. trust you. means matter reform health care, promise American people: like doctor, able doctor, period. like health care plan, you'll able health care plan, period. away, matter what. view health care reform guided simple principle: Fix what's broken build works. that's intend do. that, build health care allows physicians administrators accountants; gives Americans -- gives Americans best care lowest cost; eases pressure businesses unleashes promise economy, creating hundreds thousands jobs, making take-home wages thousands dollars higher, growing economy tens billions dollars year. That's we'll spending tax dollars prop unsustainable system, start investing dollars innovations advances health care economy stronger. That's opportunity. that's moment. Now, news instances, there's widespread agreement steps health care work better. First, need upgrade medical records switching paper electronic record keeping. we've begun investment Recovery Act. simply doesn't sense patients 21st century filling forms pens papers stored away somewhere. Newt Gingrich rightly pointed -- don't quote Newt Gingrich -- job tracking FedEx package country tracking patients' health records. shouldn't tell new doctor medical history prescriptions you're taking. shouldn't repeat costly tests. stored securely private medical record tracked doctor -- change jobs, move, number specialists. That's common sense. mean paper-pushing lower administrative costs, saving taxpayers billions dollars; mean physicians easier time jobs. tell you, doctors, drugs patient taking avoid prescribing medication cause harmful interaction. prevent wrong dosages going patient. reduce medical errors, it's estimated, lead 100,000 lives lost unnecessarily hospitals year. shouldn't argument there. want sure we're helping providers computerize running. second step agree invest preventive care avoid illness disease place. starts taking responsibility health health children. means quitting smoking. means going mammogram colon cancer screening. means going run hitting gym, raising children step away video games spend time playing outside. means cutting junk food that's fueling epidemic obesity -- puts far Americans, young old, greater risk costly, chronic conditions. That's lesson Michelle tried instill daughters. know, started White House vegetable garden. say ""we"" generously, Michelle work. That's lesson work local school districts incorporate school lunch programs. Building health care promotes prevention managing diseases require parts. doctors telling risk factors avoid preventive measures pursue. employers following example places like Safeway rewarding workers taking care health reducing health care costs process. you're three-quarters Safeway workers enrolled ""Healthy Measures"" program, screened problems like high cholesterol high blood pressure. score well, pay lower premiums; money paycheck. It's program helped Safeway cut health care spending 13 percent, workers save 20 percent premiums. we're open help employers adopt expand programs like one. federal government step efforts advance cause healthy living. costliest illnesses conditions -- cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung disease, strokes -- prevented. fraction health care dollar goes prevention public health. that's starting change investment we're making prevention wellness programs help avoid disease harm health health economy. important are, investments electronic records preventive care, I've mentioned, they're preliminary steps. dent epidemic rising costs country. suggested, reason spiraling costs simply we've aging population; demographics account rising costs older, sicker societies pay health care younger, healthier ones, there's intrinsically wrong taking care ourselves. accounts bulk costs nature health care delivery -- spend vast amounts money aren't necessarily making people healthier; automatically equates expensive care care. Now, recent article New Yorker, example, showed McAllen, Texas, spending twice El Paso County -- twice -- people McAllen, Texas, sicker El Paso; they're care outcomes. It's simply they're using treatments -- treatments that, cases, don't need; treatments that, cases, actually people harm raising risk infection medical error. problem pattern repeating America. Dartmouth study shows you're likely -- you're likely die heart attack ailments higher-spending area lower-spending one. reasons this. incentives tests services provided, money pay. people room know I'm talking about. It's model rewards quantity care quality care; pushes you, doctor, patients can't spend time each, gives incentive order extra MRI EKG, it's necessary. It's model taken pursuit medicine profession -- calling -- business. That's doctors. That's hours Anatomy Suite O.R. That's brings patient's bedside check in, makes loved patient say fine. didn't enter profession bean-counters paper-pushers. entered profession healers. that's health care let be. That's health care let be. Now, starts reforming way compensate providers -- doctors hospitals. need bundle payments aren't paid single treatment offer patient chronic condition like diabetes, paid treat disease. need create incentives physicians team up, know happens, results healthier patient. need doctors bonuses health outcomes, we're promoting treatment, care. need rethink cost medical education, reward medical students choose career primary care physician -- choose work underserved areas lucrative paths. That's we're making substantial investment National Health Service Corps medical training affordable primary care doctors nurse practitioners aren't drowning debt enter workforce. drowning debt. second structural reform need improve quality medical making way doctors patients. best medical schools, sophisticated labs, advanced training nation globe. we're job harnessing collective knowledge experience behalf medicine. 1 percent health care spending goes examining treatments effective -- 1 percent. finds way journals, 17 years way exam room operating table. result, doctors patients making decisions benefit latest research. recent study, example, half cardiac guidelines based scientific evidence -- half. means doctors bypass operation placing stent equally effective; placing stent adjusting patient's drug medical management equally effective -- drives costs improving patient's health. need figure works, encourage rapid implementation works practices. That's we're making major investment research identify best treatments variety ailments conditions. Now, let clear -- want clear -- identifying works dictating kind care provided. It's patients doctors need best medical decisions. See, assumption makes patients well, that's you're going do. confidence that. We're going need force it. need sure you've best available. Still, know works, making it. that's need build examples outstanding medicine places like Cincinnati Children's Hospital, quality care cystic fibrosis patients shot hospital began incorporating suggestions parents. places like Tallahassee Memorial Health Care, deaths dramatically reduced rapid response teams monitored patients' conditions, ""multidisciplinary rounds"" physicians pharmacists. places like Geisinger Health rural Pennsylvania, Intermountain Health Salt Lake City, high-quality care cost national average. islands excellence need standard health care system. replicating best practices, incentivizing excellence, closing cost disparities -- legislation desk -- achieve goals mind earn title reform. signature enough. need help, doctors, Americans health care system. Americans -- include Michelle kids -- tell do. That's do. listen you, trust you. that's listen work pursue reform works you. Together, steps, convinced bring spending down, bring quality up; save hundreds billions dollars health care costs making health care work patients doctors alike. align interests patients doctors, we're going place. Now, recognize hard changes doctors feel like they're constantly looking shoulders fear lawsuits. recognize that. Don't excited yet. Now, understand doctors feel need order tests treatments avoid legally vulnerable. That's real issue. Now, hold horses here, guys. want honest you. I'm advocating caps malpractice awards -- personally believe unfair people who've wrongfully harmed. think need explore range ideas patient safety first; let doctors focus practicing medicine; encourage broader evidence-based guidelines. want work AMA scale excessive defensive medicine reinforces current system, shift care, simply -- simply treatment. going priority me. know, based responses, it's priority you. look forward working you. it's going difficult. stuff going difficult. it's going important. Now, know long speech, do. changes spoken about, going need hand-in-hand reforms. health care complex medicine evolving, need way continually evaluate eliminate waste, reduce costs, improve quality. That's I'm open expanding role commission created Republican Congress called Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, happens include number physicians commission. recent years, commission proposed roughly $200 billion savings law. recommendations incorporated broader reform agenda, need fast-track proposals, commission's proposals, future don't miss opportunity save billions dollars, gain works doesn't work health care system. seek contain cost health care, ensure American coverage afford. it's economic interests. time uninsured American steps foot emergency room way reimburse hospital care, cost handed American family $1,000 that's reflected higher taxes, higher premiums, higher health care costs. It's hidden tax, hidden cut insure Americans. insure young healthy American, spread risk insurance companies, reducing costs everyone. economic arguments, there's another, powerful one. simply this: nation accepts nearly 46 million uninsured men, women children. nation lets hardworking families coverage, turns need. We're nation cares citizens. look another. That's makes United States America. need done. need affordable health insurance single American. need protect what's working health care system. case didn't catch time, let repeat: like health care doctor, reform mean health care cost less. says otherwise, trying mislead don't straight. Now, don't like health care coverage don't insurance all, you'll chance, we've proposed, we're calling Health Insurance Exchange. exchange allow one-stop shop health care plan, compare benefits prices, choose plan that's best family -- way, way, federal employees do, postal worker member Congress. choice number plans offer packages, plan offer affordable, basic package. Again, people aren't happy current plan. like you're getting, it. forcing shift. you're not, gives new options. believe options needs public option people broader range choices -- inject competition health care market force -- force waste insurance companies honest. Now, know there's concern public option. organization there's healthy debate it. particular, understand you're concerned today's Medicare rates, feel low, applied broadly way means cost savings coming backs. legitimate concerns, they're ones, believe, overcome. stated earlier, reforms propose reimbursement reward best practices, focus patient care, current piecework reimbursements. seek stability health care that's sounder financial footing. reforms need place regardless there's public option not. reform, ensure reimbursed thoughtful way that's tied patient outcomes, relying yearly negotiations Sustainable Growth Rate formula that's based politics state federal budget given year. want point alternative reform world health care costs grow unsustainable rate. don't think that's going threaten reimbursements stability health care system, haven't paying attention. public option enemy; friend, believe. Let say -- let address illegitimate concern that's forward claiming public option Trojan horse single-payer system. I'll honest; countries single-payer works pretty well. believe -- I've taken flak members party belief -- it's important reform efforts build traditions United States. hear naysayers claim I'm trying bring government-run health care, know this: They're telling truth. trying -- public option help -- affordable health care reach millions Americans. help ensure afford cost health care option exchange, need assistance families need it. way, reason remain uninsured. Indeed, it's I'm confident ability people ability insurance affordable rate I'm open American bears responsibility health insurance -- long hardship waiver can't afford system. true employers. believe business responsibility health insurance workers, small businesses can't afford receive exemption. small business workers families able seek coverage exchange employer able it. Now, here's news. Insurance companies expressed support idea covering uninsured certainly favor mandate. welcome willingness engage constructively reform debate. I'm glad they're table. refuse simply create insurance companies suddenly bunch customers Uncle Sam's dime, fail meet responsibilities. We're going that. Let example I'm talking about. need end practice denying coverage basis preexisting conditions. days cherry-picking cover deny, days over. know practices, incredibly painful frustrating -- want care insurance companies wiggling paying. personal also. I've told story before. I'll forget watching mother, fought cancer final days, spending time worrying insurer claim illness preexisting condition coverage. Changing current approach preexisting conditions -- mother mother, father, son, daughter, suffered practice, who've paying premiums don't care. need health care reach millions Americans. Now, accept economic moral reasons affordable coverage Americans, denying expanding coverage come cost, short run. cost -- repeat -- add deficits. I've set rule staff, team -- I've Congress -- health care reform be, be, deficit-neutral decade. Now, voices saying numbers don't add up. They're wrong. Here's why. Making health care affordable Americans cost order $1 trillion 10 years. That's real money, Washington. remember, that's projected spent war Iraq. remember, reform health care way genuinely reduces cost growth cost trillions dollars lost economic growth lower wages. said, let explain cover price tag. First, budget passed months ago, $635 billion 10 years we're calling Health Reserve Fund. half -- $300 billion -- come raising revenue like modestly limiting tax deductions wealthiest Americans level end Reagan years -- level Ronald Reagan. concerned dramatically reduce charitable giving, example, statistics that's true. best charities stronger economy build health care reform. can't raise revenues. We're going spending cuts, examining inefficiencies current Medicare program. going robust debates cuts made, welcome debate. here's think cuts made. First, end overpayments Medicare Advantage. Today, we're paying Medicare Advantage plans pay traditional Medicare services. Now, deal insurance companies. It's subsidy insurance companies. It's deal you. It's deal American people. way, doesn't follow free market principles, talking free market principles. That's need introduce competitive bidding Medicare Advantage program, program private insurance companies offering Medicare coverage. save $177 billion decade, step. Second, need Medicare reimbursements reduce preventable hospital readmissions. Right now, 20 percent Medicare patients discharged hospitals readmitted month, they're comprehensive care need. puts people risk; drives cost. changing Medicare reimburses hospitals, discourage acting way boosts profits drives costs else. save $25 billion decade. Third, need introduce generic biologic drugs marketplace.These drugs treat illnesses like anemia. right now, pathway FDA approving generic versions drugs. Creating pathway save billions dollars. save roughly $30 billion deal poorer seniors asking well-off seniors pay little drugs. that's bulk what's Health Reserve Fund. I've proposed saving $313 billion Medicare Medicaid spending ways. way adjusting Medicare payments reflect new advances productivity gains economy. Right now, Medicare payments rising year should. adjustments create incentives providers deliver care efficiently, save roughly $109 billion process. way achieve savings reducing payments hospitals treating uninsured people. know hospitals rely payments now, legitimately, large number uninsured patients treat. people coverage number uninsured people goes reforms, pay hospitals treat uninsured people down, well. Reducing payments gradually, people coverage, save $106 billion. we'll sure difference goes hospitals need most. save $75 billion efficient purchasing prescription drugs. save $1 billion rooting waste, abuse, fraud health care charging service it's worth charging dime service don't provide. Let clear: I'm committed making cuts way protects senior citizens. fact, proposals actually extend life Medicare Trust Fund years, reduce premiums Medicare beneficiaries roughly $43 billion 10 years. I'm working AARP uphold commitment. Now, took pencil paper -- altogether, savings mean we've $950 billion table -- doesn't count long-term savings think come reform -- medical IT, example, increased investment prevention. stuff congressional jargon scorable; Congressional Budget Office won't count savings, we're setting aside. think that's going come, separate far that, we've $950 billion table, taking way covering cost health care reform. weeks months ahead, look forward working Congress difference health care reform fully paid -- real, accountable way. let add count longer-term savings. want repeat that. insisting reforms we're introducing deficit-neutral decade, making reforms help slow growth rate health care costs coming decades -- bending curve -- look forward faster economic growth, higher living standards, falling, rising, budget deficits. Now, let wrap saying this. know people cynical not. know disagreements proceed days ahead. There's healthy debate AMA.

See, half -- half students enter community college earn associate degree, transfer four-year school earn bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail reach goal. That's waste valuable resource, that's tragedy students. Oftentimes they've taken debt don't degree, pay debt. it's disaster economy. we'll fund programs track student progress inside classroom. Let's figure what's keeping students crossing finish line, place reforms remove barriers. Maybe difficult parent away home, expensive waiter nurse miss shift. Maybe young student isn't sure education lead employment. point is, need figure solutions kinds challenges -- facing impediments shouldn't prevent reaching potential. right, that's big chunk initiative. second part: We're going $10 billion loans renovate rebuild college classrooms buildings country. often, community colleges treated like stepchild higher education system; they're afterthought, they're thought all. means schools years facilities provide, means, 21st century economy, they're years education offer. That's mistake it's we'll help correct. fund, schools chance borrow affordable rate modernize facilities, they'll building funds recovery plan helping renovate schools, including community colleges country. way, improve schools training they're providing, guess what? hire workers tradesmen women work schools. means it's putting people work Michigan right right now.

Now, that's Americans health insurance expect plan -- security stability. Now, you're tens millions Americans don't currently health insurance, second plan finally offer quality, affordable choices. lose job change job, you'll able coverage. strike start small business, you'll able coverage.

Now, affordable options, -- especially young healthy -- want risk coverage. companies refuse right workers giving coverage. problem is, irresponsible behavior costs rest money. affordable options people don't sign health insurance, means pay people's expensive emergency room visits. businesses don't workers health care, forces rest pick tab workers sick, gives businesses unfair advantage competitors. part, insurance reforms seek -- especially requiring insurance companies cover preexisting conditions -- can't achieved. that's plan, individuals required carry basic health insurance -- states require carry auto insurance.

It's true. misunderstanding want clear -- plan, federal dollars fund abortions, federal conscience laws remain place. Now, health care proposal attacked oppose reform ""government takeover"" entire health care system. proof, critics point provision plan allows uninsured small businesses choose publicly sponsored insurance option, administered government like Medicaid Medicare. let set record straight here. guiding principle is, been, consumers choice competition. That's market works. Unfortunately, 34 states, 75 percent insurance market controlled companies. Alabama, 90 percent controlled company. competition, price insurance goes quality goes down. makes easier insurance companies treat customers badly -- cherry-picking healthiest individuals trying drop sickest, overcharging small businesses leverage, jacking rates. Insurance executives don't they're bad people; it's profitable. insurance executive testified Congress, insurance companies encouraged reasons drop seriously ill, rewarded it. service meeting executive called ""Wall Street's relentless profit expectations."" Now, putting insurance companies business. legitimate service, employ friends neighbors. want hold accountable. insurance reforms I've mentioned that. additional step insurance companies honest making not-for-profit public option insurance exchange. Now, let clear.

Now, -- it's worth noting strong majority Americans favor public insurance option sort I've proposed tonight. impact shouldn't exaggerated -- left right media. plan, shouldn't handy excuse usual Washington ideological battles. progressive friends, remind decades, driving idea reform end insurance company abuses coverage it. public option -- public option means end -- remain open ideas accomplish ultimate goal. Republican friends, say making wild claims government takeover health care, work address legitimate concerns have. example -- example, suggested public option effect markets insurance companies affordable policies. proposed co-op non-profit entity administer plan. constructive ideas worth exploring. basic principle Americans can't affordable coverage, choice. sure government bureaucrat insurance company bureaucrat care need. Finally, let discuss issue great concern me, members chamber, public -- that's pay plan. here's need know. First, sign plan adds dime deficits -- future. sign adds dime deficit, future, period. prove I'm serious, provision plan requires come forward spending cuts savings promised don't materialize. Now, reason faced trillion-dollar deficit walked door White House initiatives decade paid -- Iraq war tax breaks wealthy. mistake health care. Second, we've estimated plan paid finding savings existing health care system, currently waste abuse. Right now, hard-earned savings tax dollars spend health care don't healthier. That's judgment -- it's judgment medical professionals country. true comes Medicare Medicaid. fact, want speak directly seniors moment, Medicare issue that's subjected demagoguery distortion course debate. decades ago, nation stood principle lifetime hard work, seniors left struggle pile medical bills later years.

Now, Medicare big health care system, making program efficient help usher changes way deliver health care reduce costs everybody. long known places -- like Intermountain Healthcare Utah Geisinger Health rural Pennsylvania -- offer high-quality care costs average. commission help encourage adoption common-sense best practices doctors medical professionals -- reducing hospital infection rates encouraging coordination teams doctors. Reducing waste inefficiency Medicare Medicaid pay plan. Now, rest paid revenues drug insurance companies stand benefit tens millions new customers. reform charge insurance companies fee expensive policies, encourage greater value money -- idea support Democratic Republican experts. according experts, modest change help hold cost health care long run. Now, finally, chamber -- Republican aisle -- long insisted reforming medical malpractice laws help bring cost health care. -- go. go. Now, don't believe malpractice reform silver bullet, I've talked doctors know defensive medicine contributing unnecessary costs.So I'm proposing forward range ideas patient safety let doctors focus practicing medicine. know Bush administration considered authorizing demonstration projects individual states test ideas. think it's idea, I'm directing Secretary Health Human Services forward initiative today.

2010-02-01,./Data/barackobama2010budgettocongress.txt,"morning, everybody. morning, budget Congress coming year. It's budget reflects challenges facing country. We're war. economy lost 7 million jobs years. government deeply debt decade profligacy. is, 10 years ago, budget surplus $200 billion, projected surpluses stretching horizon. course past 10 years, previous administration previous Congresses created expensive new drug program, passed massive tax cuts wealthy, funded wars paying -- compounded recession rising health care costs. result, walked door, deficit stood $1.3 trillion, projected deficits $8 trillion decade. taken office ordinary times, started bringing deficits immediately. year ago, country crisis: losing nearly 700,000 jobs month, economy free fall, financial near collapse. feared Great Depression. initiated rescue, rescue significant cost; added deficit well. year later, steps we've taken, we're place. can't simply crisis; address irresponsibility led it. includes failure rein spending, reliance borrowing -- Wall Street Washington Street -- fuel growth. That's change. families America doing: Save afford need. Now, think it's important understand: won't able bring deficit overnight, given recovery taking hold families country need help. continue, example, takes create jobs. That's reflected budget; it's essential. budget includes new tax cuts people invest small businesses, tax credits small businesses hire new workers, investments create jobs repairing roads bridges, tax breaks retrofitting homes save energy. continue lay new foundation lasting growth, essential well. terrible mistake borrow children's future pay way today, equally wrong neglect future invest areas determine economic success new century. That's build largest investment clean energy history, increase investment scientific research, fostering industries jobs future right America. That's I've proposed 6 percent increase funding Education Department. funding tied reforms raise student achievement, inspire students excel math science, turn schools consign young people lesser future -- 21st century anti-poverty program world-class education. that's eliminate wasteful subsidy banks lend college students, money revitalize community colleges college affordable. help reach goal I've set America: 2020 highest proportion college graduates world. investments create jobs opportunity future. departure way business Washington, actually pay investments putting country fiscally sustainable path. I've proposed freeze government spending years. won't apply benefits folks Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare. won't apply national security -- including benefits veterans. apply discretionary government programs. we're simply photocopying year's budget; freezing spending mean won't cut doesn't work pay does. department's spending line line, item item, looking inefficiency, duplication, programs outlived usefulness. That's freeze discretionary spending. year, $17 billion cuts. year, we've $20 billion. Now, cuts common sense. example, cut $115 million program pays states clean mines cleaned up. We're cutting Forest Service economic development program strayed far mission funded music festival. we're saving $20 million stopping refurbishment Department Energy science center Department Energy want refurbish. cuts, though, painful, goals underlying programs worthy. eliminate program grants environmental clean abandoned buildings. That's mission support, sources private public funds achieve it. eliminated $120 million program allows folks Earned Income Tax Credit advance. big supporter Earned Income Tax Credit. problem 80 percent people advance didn't comply program's requirements. I'm willing reduce waste programs care about, I'm asking members Congress same. I'm asking Republicans Democrats alike fresh look programs they've supported past what's working what's not, trim accordingly. Like business, we're looking ways bang buck, promoting innovation cutting red tape. example, consolidate 38 separate education programs 11. fall, launched ""SAVE Awards"" solicit ideas federal employees government efficient effective. I'm proud say number ideas -- like allowing Social Security appointments online -- budget. want note Department Defense exempt budget freeze, it's exempt budget common sense. It's exempt looking savings. save money eliminating unnecessary defense programs safe. example $2.5 billion we're spending build C-17 transport aircraft. years ago, Defense Department decided cease production acquired number requested -- 180. year since, Congress unrequested money C-17s Pentagon doesn't want need. It's waste, pure simple. steps we're taking rein deficits. I've proposed fee big banks pay taxpayers bailout. We're reforming way contracts awarded, save taxpayers billions dollars. extend middle-class tax cuts budget, continue costly tax cuts oil companies, investment fund managers, making $250,000 year. can't afford it. Finally, changing spending-as-usual depends changing politics-as-usual. that's I've proposed bipartisan fiscal commission: panel Democrats Republicans hammer concrete deficit reduction proposals medium long term, come answers deadline. point out, way, idea strong bipartisan support, originally introduced Senators Gregg Republican Conrad Democratic side; Republican cosponsors idea. hope that, voted Senate, Republican Leader Mitch McConnell Republican Leader House John Boehner ahead fully embrace bipartisan idea arms budget. That's we're restoring pay-as-you-go: simple rule says Congress can't spend dime cutting dime elsewhere. rule helped lead budget surpluses 1990s, it's important steps restore fiscal discipline Washington. read budget budget.gov -- easy remember --budget.gov. line this: simply continue spend deficits don't consequences; waste doesn't matter; hard-earned tax dollars American people treated like Monopoly money; ignore challenge generation. can't. order meet challenge, welcome idea, Democrats Republicans. welcome -- reject -- old grandstanding cameras on, irresponsible budget policies cameras off.

I'm concerned insurance industry freer rein raise premiums deny care. don't believe government bureaucrats insurance company bureaucrats control health care America. believe it's time American people control health care health insurance. don't believe afford leave life-and-death decisions health care discretion insurance company executives alone. believe doctors nurses physician assistants like ones room free decide what's best patients. Now, proposal forward gives Americans control health insurance health care holding insurance companies accountable. builds current Americans health insurance employer. like plan, plan. like doctor, doctor. tell father young girls, want plan interferes relationship family doctor. Essentially, proposal change current health care system. First, end worst practices insurance companies. longer able deny coverage preexisting condition. longer able drop coverage sick. longer able force pay unlimited amounts money pocket. longer able arbitrarily massively raise premiums like Anthem Blue Cross recently tried California -- 39 percent increases year individual market. practices end. Second, proposal uninsured individuals small business owners kind choice private health insurance members Congress -- it’s members Congress, it’s people pay salaries. reason federal employees deal health insurance participate insurance market insurance companies coverage rates, customers. It's idea Republicans embraced past, politics intruded. proposal says can’t afford insurance new marketplace, it's going deals people right individual marketplace, we'll offer tax credits -- tax credits add largest middle-class tax cut health care history. all, wealthiest buy best insurance is, able coverage Medicaid. it's middle class squeezed, that’s help. Now, absolutely true cost money -- $100 billion year. comes nearly $2 trillion year America spends health care -- spent wisely. money wasted spent badly. plan, we’re going sure dollars spend making insurance affordable secure. We’re going eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies currently insurance pharmaceutical companies; set new fee insurance companies stand gain money profits millions Americans able buy insurance; we're going sure wealthiest Americans pay fair share Medicare. line proposal paid for. new money generated plan goes small businesses middle-class families can't afford health insurance. lower prescription drug prices seniors. help train new doctors nurses physician assistants care American families. Finally, proposal bring cost health care millions -- families, businesses, federal government. incorporated ideas political spectrum contain rising cost health care -- ideas waste abuse system, especially programs like Medicare. protecting Medicare benefits, extending financial stability program nearly decade. cost-cutting measures mirror proposals current Senate bill, reduces people's premiums brings deficit trillion dollars decades -- brings deficit. aren't numbers; savings determined Congressional Budget Office, Washington acronym nonpartisan, independent referee Congress terms stuff costs. that's proposal. we've ended up. It's approach debated changed believe improved year. incorporates best ideas Democrats Republicans -- including ideas Republicans offered health care summit, like funding state grants medical malpractice reform, curbing waste fraud abuse health care system. proposal rid provisions place health care reform -- provisions winning individual votes Congress improving health care Americans. Now, agree Republican ideas we've incorporated, -- -- Republicans Congress fundamental disagreement oversight insurance companies. truly believe regulation lead higher quality, affordable health insurance, vote proposal I've forward. Now, believe should, I'm proposing, pursue piecemeal approach health insurance reform, tinker edges challenge years. acknowledge problem uninsured say can't afford help right -- Republican proposal covers 3 million uninsured Americans cover 31 million. problem approach access affordable coverage, can't prevent insurance companies denying coverage based preexisting conditions; can't limit families forced pay pockets. insurance reforms rest access coverage. don't taxpayers currently end subsidizing uninsured they're forced emergency room care, tune thousand bucks family. can't savings people going emergency room. is, health reform works care problems once. Now, week's summit, Republicans Congress insisted acceptable course health care reform start over. given honest substantial differences parties need regulate insurance industry need help millions middle-class families insurance, don't year negotiations help. Moreover, insurance companies aren't starting over. They're continuing raise premiums deny coverage speak. start simply lead delay decade, more. American people, U.S. economy, can't wait long. So, matter approach favor, believe United States Congress owes American people final vote health care reform. debated issue thoroughly, past year decades. Reform passed House majority. passed Senate supermajority 60 votes. deserves kind vote cast welfare reform, cast Children's Health Insurance Program, COBRA health coverage unemployed, and, way, Bush tax cuts -- pass Congress simple majority. I, therefore, ask leaders houses Congress finish work schedule vote weeks. then, power case reform. urge American wants reform voice heard -- family, business, patient, doctor, nurse, physician’s assistant. voice heard. long wrenching debate. stoked great passions American people representatives. that's health care difficult issue. complicated issue. easy, solved long ago. know experience, health care literally issue life death. result, easily lends demagoguery political gamesmanship, misrepresentation misunderstanding. that’s excuse lead.

Moreover, democracy nation 300 million people inherently difficult. It’s noisy messy, contentious, complicated. We’ve fighting proper size role government day Framers gathered Philadelphia. We’ve battled meaning individual freedom equality Rights drafted. economy shifted emphasis agriculture industry, information, technology, argued struggled juncture best way ensure citizens shot opportunity. depressed current state politics, let’s remember history. great debates past stirred great passions. angry, led terrible war. amazing conflict, flaws frustrations, experiment democracy worked form government Earth. day Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin famously asked, “Well, Doctor, -- republic monarchy?” Franklin gave answer that’s quoted ages: said, “A republic, it.” it. Well, 200 years, kept it. revolution civil war, democracy survived. depression world war, prevailed. periods great social economic unrest, civil rights women’s rights, allowed slowly, painfully, perfect union. now, class 2010, generation this: democracy going? moment challenges big politics small, democracy alive vibrant; century? I’m offer grand theory detailed policy prescription. let offer brief reflections based experiences experiences country centuries. all, American democracy thrived recognized need government that, limited, help adapt changing world. fourth panel Jefferson Memorial quote remember reading daughters visit there. says, “I advocate frequent changes laws constitutions, but...with change circumstances, institutions advance pace times.” democracy designed Jefferson founders intended solve problem new law new program. thrown tyranny British Empire, Americans understandably skeptical government. we’ve held fast belief government doesn’t answers, cherished fiercely defended individual freedom. That’s strand nation’s DNA. strand belief together, nation -- government pace times. America expanded colonies entire continent, needed way reach Pacific, government helped build railroads. transitioned economy based farms based factories, workers needed new skills training, nation set public high schools. markets crashed Depression people lost life savings, government place set rules safeguards sure crisis happened again, safety net place sure elders impoverished way been. markets financial systems evolved then, we’re putting place new rules safeguards protect American people. Now, notion -- notion, class, hasn’t partisan. Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, role government people themselves. he’d begin intercontinental railroad set land-grant colleges. Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, said, “the object government welfare people.” he’s remembered using power government break monopolies, establish National Park system. Democrat Lyndon Johnson announced Great Society commencement Michigan, Republican him, Dwight Eisenhower, launched massive government undertaking known Interstate Highway System. course, who’ve opposed efforts. argue government intervention inefficient; restricts individual freedom dampens individual initiative. instances, that’s true. years, welfare discouraged people taking responsibility upward mobility. times, we’ve neglected role parents, government, cultivating child’s education. regulation fails, benefits don’t justify costs. troubles hear people say government inherently bad. favorite signs health care debate said, “Keep Government Hands Medicare” -- essentially saying “Keep Government Government-Run Health Care Plan.” government spoken menacing, threatening foreign entity, ignores democracy, government us. We, people -- We, people, hold hands power choose leaders change laws, shape destiny. Government police officers protecting communities, servicemen women defending abroad.

Government extraordinary public university -- place that’s lifesaving research, catalyzing economic growth, graduating students change world ways big small. truth is, debate we’ve decades government government, doesn’t fit times live. know government stifle competition deprive choice burden debt. we’ve clearly seen dangers little government -- like lack accountability Wall Street nearly leads collapse entire economy. So, class 2010, asking need “big government” “small government,” create smarter government. era iPods Tivo, choices -- can't work -- 23-year-olds -- government shouldn’t try dictate lives. tools need succeed. Government shouldn’t try guarantee results, guarantee shot opportunity American who’s willing work hard. -- So, yes, debate role government lives. remember, asked meet challenges time, remember ability adapt government needs age helped democracy work inception.

Throwing phrases like “socialists” “Soviet-style takeover” “fascist” “right-wing nut” -- grab headlines, effect comparing government, political opponents, authoritarian, murderous regimes. Now, we’ve seen kind politics past. It’s practiced fringes ideological spectrum, left right, nation’s birth. it’s starting creep center discourse. problem hurt feelings bruised egos public officials criticized. Remember, signed it. Michelle reminds that. problem kind vilification over-the-top rhetoric closes door possibility compromise. undermines democratic deliberation. prevents learning -- since, all, listen “fascist,” “socialist,” “right-wing nut,” left-wing nut”? makes nearly impossible people legitimate bridgeable differences sit table hash out. robs rational debate, need real big challenges facing nation. coarsens culture, worst, signals extreme elements society violence justifiable response. do? year White House, changing type politics easy. civility requires recall simple lesson learned parents: Treat like treated, courtesy respect. civility age requires asking can’t along.

You’d ask them, want grow up?

Right? That’s joke. learn that, especially you’re boy. That’s placed heavy emphasis education children kindergarten 12th grade. Now, past 18 months, single important we’ve -- we’ve lot. mean, Recovery Act money schools, teacher jobs, sure schools didn’t cut drastically community country. think single important we’ve launch initiative called Race Top. states, committed outstanding teaching, successful schools, higher standards, assessments -– you’re committed excellence children -– eligible grant help attain goal. far, results promising powerful. effort compete extra money, 32 states reformed education laws spent dime. competition leveraged change state level. standards set high, couple states actually won grant round, meant states didn’t money, they’ve strengthened applications, additional reforms. 36 applied second round, 18 states plus District Columbia running second grant. understand what’s happened. successive round, we’ve leveraged change country. students districts haven’t grant, they’ve benefited reforms initiated. process sown seeds achievement. It’s forced teachers principals officials parents forge agreements tough, uncomfortable issues -- raise sights embrace education. part, states, educators, reformers, they’ve responded great enthusiasm promise excellence. know there’s controversy Race Top. it, believe, reflects general resistance change. comfortable status quo status quo isn’t good. excuses way are. try shake up, people aren’t happy. criticisms folks civil rights community elements Race Top. want address today. told we’re going honest conversation. First, know there’s concern Race doesn’t minority kids, argument is, well, there’s competition, states school districts help others. Let tell you, what’s working black kids Hispanic kids Native American kids country status quo. That's what’s working. What’s working we’ve decades now. charge Race isn’t targeted young people need absolutely false lifting quality children -- black, white, Hispanic -- central premise Race Top. can’t win grants you’ve plan deal schools young people aren’t well. state school district directly incentivized deal schools forgotten, given on. want directly speak issue teachers. teachers house. know Urban League teachers. important teachers. sister teacher. I’m great teachers. premise Race teachers single important factor child’s education moment step classroom. know firsthand vast majority teachers working tirelessly, passionate students, digging pockets basic supplies, going duty. want teachers higher salaries. want support. want trained like professionals –- rigorous residencies like ones doctors through. want career ladder they’ve opportunities advance, earn real financial security. don't want talented young people say I’d love teach can’t afford it. want fulfilling supportive workplace environment. want resources -- basic supplies reasonable class sizes -- help succeed. culture we’re idolizing sports stars celebrities, want build culture idolize people shaping children’s future. want teachers covers magazines. teachers MTV, featured. “The View” yesterday, asked Snooki was. said, don't know Snooki is. know teachers guys talking about. didn't say teacher part, -- is, lifting up? promoting? saying important? 110 percent teachers. I’m asking return -- President, parent, citizen -- measure accountability. applaud teachers hard work, we’ve sure we’re seeing results classroom. we’re seeing results classroom, let’s work teachers help effective. doesn’t work, let’s right teacher classroom. Arne makes point simply: children chance education, need right. want commend teachers unions country working improve teaching -- like Delaware Education Association, working state leaders Race efforts, set 90 minutes collaboration time week improve instruction, strengthen teacher development evaluation. That's right way go. So, wants Race blame punish teachers -- you’re missing point. goal isn’t admonish teachers; goal accountability. It’s teachers support need effective be, create environment teachers students alike. Now, there’s hard teachers push students classroom. Nations Asia Europe answered question, creating standards sure teachers students performing high levels nation. That’s reasons children ours. home, there’s controversy national standards, common standards -- violates principle local control. Now, there’s history local control need think about, -- that’s argument. here’s Race says: Washington imposing standards down, let’s challenge states adopt common standards voluntarily, up. doesn’t mean standards; means higher standards, standards, standards clarify teachers expected teach children expected learn -– high school graduates actually prepared college career. want young people diploma can’t read diploma. Now, far, 30 states come embrace develop common standards, high standards. states expected coming weeks. way, Child Left Behind, gave states wrong incentives. bunch states watered standards school districts wouldn’t penalized students fell short. what’s happened is, states -– Illinois Oklahoma –- lowered standards response Child -- Child Left -- raising standards up, partly response Race Top. making sure young people meet high standards designing tests accurately measure learning. Now, here, too, there’s controversy. talk testing, parents worry means teaching test. worry tests culturally biased. Teachers worry they’ll evaluated solely basis single standardized test. thinks that’s unfair. unfair. that’s Race about. Race says is, there’s wrong testing -– need tests applied way helps teachers students, stifling teachers students classroom. Tests don’t dictate what’s taught, tell learned. Tests measure children mastering essential skills answering complex questions. tests track students growing academically, catch they’re falling help passed along. Race Top, states finding innovative ways snapshot students are, real-time picture shows far they’ve come far go. armed information, teachers amounts game tape study enhance teaching focus areas students need help most. Now, school’s problems run deep assessments higher standards challenging curriculum, that’s enough. school isn’t producing graduates basic skills –- year year year year -– needs differently. know, definition, said, madness expecting result. want success country, can’t accept failure schools decade decade. that’s we’re challenging states turn 5,000 lowest performing schools. don’t think it’s secret serving African American Hispanic kids. We’re investing $4 billion help that, transform schools -– $4 billion, Washington real money. isn’t -- Child Left Behind, isn’t labeling troubled school failure throwing hands saying, well, we’re giving you. It’s investing school’s future, recruiting community help turn around, identifying viable options forward. Now, cases, that’s going mean restarting school management charter school -– independent public school formed parents, teachers, civic leaders who’ve broad leeway innovate. people don’t like charter schools. say, well, that’s going away money public schools need support. Charter schools aren’t magic bullet, want states school districts chance try new things. charter school works, let’s apply lessons elsewhere. charter school doesn’t work, we’ll hold accountable; we’ll shut down. So, no, don’t support charter schools, support charter schools. I’ll example. There’s charter school called Mastery Philadelphia. years, schools Mastery taken seen reading math levels nearly double –- cases, triple. Chaka Fattah here, knows I’m talking about. school called Pickett went 14 percent students proficient math 70 percent. -- here’s kicker -- time academic performance improved, violence dropped 80 percent -– 80 percent. that’s coincidence. Now, school like Mastery it, Pickett it, troubled school it. means we’re going shake up. Setting high standards, common standards, empowering students meet them; partnering teachers achieve excellence classroom; educating children -- -- graduate ready college, ready career, ready lives -- controversial. fuss weren’t things. fuss Arne Duncan wasn’t trying shake up. Race Top, isn’t simply initiative. sums what’s happening schools. It’s single ambitious, meaningful education reform effort we’ve attempted country generations. know number steps need lift education -- like saving teachers’ jobs country layoffs -- I’ll continue fighting steps save jobs. I’ll continue fight Race I’ve got, including using veto prevent folks watering down. Now, let wrap saying this. know say Race won’t work. cynics naysayers argue problems education entrenched, think we’ll fall old arguments divides held long. true, I’ve ran President, knows firsthand, change hard. don't know you’ve noticed. That's I’ve gray hair. Fixing broken health care easy. Fixing broken Wall Street easy. Fixing what’s broken education easy. won’t results overnight. decade changes pay off. that’s reason them. It’s reason start making right now, feel sense urgency -- fierce urgency now. know significant reforms are, there’s going ingredient difference: parents going involved children’s education. Now, past, statement sparked controversy. Folks say, well, talking parents? Parents need help, too. know that. Parents need jobs. need housing. need -- cases -- social services. substance abuse problems. We’re working fronts. people say, well, talking parental responsibility black folks? say, talk parent responsibility talk education. Michelle happen black parents, -- add little umph I’m talking black parents. paraphrase Dr. King, education isn’t either/or proposition. It’s both/and proposition. focus parents, schooling. money, reform. collective commitment, personal commitment. So, yes, federal government responsibilities meet, making sure federal government meets responsibilities. governors, superintendents, states, school districts responsibilities meet. parents responsibilities meet. children responsibilities meet. It’s parents. It’s children, too. kids need understand going hand future. education tip head pour ear. You’ve want it. You’ve reach claim future yourself. can’t excuses. know life tough young people country. places Urban League working difference, day. I’m coming Southside Chicago. know -- young people going there. points lives, young black men women feel sting discrimination. feel trapped community drugs violence unemployment pervasive, forced wrestle child face. kinds reasons children say, “No, can’t.” job say them, “Yes, can.” Yes, overcome. Yes, persevere. Yes, lives. know can, know character America’s young people. saw volunteer campaign. asked questions town hall meetings. write letters trials aspirations. letter recently postmarked Covington, Kentucky.

Imagine Washington. truth is, gimmicks, slogans bit difference. gas prices finally fall, global recession led demand oil. Companies producing less; demand petroleum went down; prices went down. economy recovering, demand up. Add turmoil Middle East, it’s surprising oil prices higher. time price barrel oil world market rises $10, gallon gas goes 25 cents. point gas prices historically tended temporary. look long-term trends, going gas prices gas prices. that’s you’ve countries like India China growing rapid clip, 2 billion people start consuming goods -- want cars like we’ve cars; want energy lives little easier like we’ve -- absolutely demand faster supply. It’s fact. here’s line: quick fixes. tells isn’t telling truth. victim shifts oil market finally long-term policy secure, affordable energy future. We’re going think long term, came here, talk young people Georgetown, stake energy policy right anybody. Now, here’s source concern, though. We’ve known dangers oil dependence decades. Richard Nixon talked freeing dependence foreign oil. time talked freeing dependence foreign oil. Politicians stripe promised energy independence, promise far unmet. talked reducing America’s dependence oil running President, I’m proud historic progress we’ve years goal, we’ll talk little bit. I’ve honest. We’ve run political gridlock, inertia held decades. change. change. going shock gas prices trance -- we’ve time there’s price spike, we’re shocked again. can’t rush propose action gas prices high hit snooze button fall again. can’t that. United States America afford bet long-term prosperity, long-term security resource eventually run out, runs expensive extract ground. can’t afford costs economy, country, planet high. generation needs right. It’s time secure energy future. today, want announce new goal, reasonable, achievable, necessary. elected office, America imported 11 million barrels oil day. little decade now, cut one-third. achieve. cut oil dependence -- cut oil dependence third. set goal knowing we’re going import oil. remain important energy portfolio time, we’ve alternative energy strategies fully force. comes oil import nations, obviously we’ve look neighbors like Canada Mexico stable steady reliable sources. look countries like Brazil. reason went talk energy Brazilians. recently discovered significant new oil reserves, share American technology know-how develop resources. best opportunities enhance energy security backyard -- boast critical, renewable resource rest world can’t match: American ingenuity. American ingenuity, American know-how. secure, control energy future, we’re going harness ingenuity. It’s task won’t finished end presidency, end presidency. continue work we’ve begun years, won’t spark new jobs, industries innovations -- leave generation future generations country safer, healthier, that’s prosperous. today, administration releasing Blueprint Secure Energy Future outlines comprehensive national energy policy, we’ve pursuing day took office. cutting oil dependence plan. Georgetown, I’d like talk broad strokes achieve goals. Now, meeting goal cutting oil dependence depends largely things: first, finding producing oil home; second, reducing dependence oil cleaner alternative fuels greater efficiency. begins continuing increase America’s oil supply. interested seeing reduction dependence fossil fuels -- know passionate young people issues like climate change -- matter is, time, America going dependent oil making economy work. Now, year, American oil production reached highest level 2003. time decade, oil imported accounted half liquid fuel consumed. trend. reducing reliance imports, administration encouraging offshore oil exploration production -- long it’s safe responsible. don’t think forgotten happened year, deal largest oil spill history. know fishermen Gulf Coast haven’t forgotten it. learned disaster helped place smarter standards safety responsibility. example, you’re going drill deepwater, you’ve prove start drilling actually contain underwater spill. That’s common sense. lately, we’ve hearing folks saying, well, administration, restrictions oil companies operate offshore. Well, yes, spent time, energy money trying clean big mess. don't know you, don't amnesia. remember things. think important sure prevent like happening again. Now, today, we’re working expedite new drilling permits companies meet higher standards. in, we’ve approved 39 new shallow-water permits; we’ve approved deepwater permits recent weeks. comes drilling offshore, administration approved permits year new industry started drill. claim administration responsible gas prices we’ve “shut down” oil production, claim like simply untrue. useful sound bite, doesn’t track reality. true we’ve you’re going drill offshore you’ve plan sure don’t kind catastrophe year. don’t think there’s dispute that’s right strategy pursue. Moreover, we’re actually pushing oil industry advantage opportunities they’ve got. Right industry holds tens millions acres leases they’re producing single drop. They’re sitting supplies American energy ready tapped. That’s plan new incentives promote rapid, responsible development resources. We’re exploring assessing new frontiers oil gas development Alaska Mid- South Atlantic states, producing oil America help lower oil prices, help create jobs, enhance energy security, we’ve right way. Now, increase domestic oil production, going long-term solution energy challenge. statistic time, forgive repeating again: America holds 2 percent world’s proven oil reserves. means is, drilled drop oil single reserves possess -- offshore onshore -- wouldn’t meet long-term needs. consume 25 percent world’s oil. 2 percent reserves. doubled U.S. oil production, we’re short. way America’s energy supply truly secure permanently reducing dependence oil. We’re going ways boost efficiency oil. We’ve discover produce cleaner, renewable sources energy produce carbon pollution, threatening climate. we’ve quickly. Now, terms new sources energy, options. natural gas. Recent innovations given opportunity tap large reserves –- century’s worth reserves, years worth reserves -– shale feet. true terms extracting oil ground, we’ve sure we’re extracting natural gas safely, polluting water supply. That’s I’ve asked Secretary Chu, Energy Secretary, work agencies, natural gas industry, states, environmental experts improve safety process. Chu right guy this. He’s Nobel Prize physics. actually deserved Nobel Prize. kind likes fun weekend. goes garage tinkers figures extract natural gas. I’m going embarrass further. year, trying -- figure close cap, Chu sit BP offices, essentially designed cap ultimately worked, drew specs BP build it, construct it. knows he’s doing. studying physics, actually pay someday. potential natural gas enormous. area there’s actually broad bipartisan agreement. year, 150 members Congress sides aisle produced legislation incentives clean-burning natural gas vehicles oil. that's big deal. 150 members Congress agree big deal. joined T. Boone Pickens, businessman fortune oil, making simple point can’t simply drill way energy problems. ask members Congress interested parties involved it, pass helps achieve goal extracting natural gas safe, environmentally sound way. Now, substitute oil holds tremendous promise renewable biofuels -- ethanol, biofuels like switchgrass wood chips biomass. doubts potential fuels, consider Brazil. said, week. Half Brazil’s vehicles run biofuels -- half fleet automobiles run biofuels petroleum. week, Air Force -- Air Force -- advanced biofuel blend fly Raptor 22 -- F-22 Raptor faster speed sound. Think that. mean, F-22 Raptor fly speed -- faster speed sound biomass, know old beater you’ve got, you’re driving -- so, too. There’s reason can’t cars same. fact, Air Force aiming half domestic jet fuel alternative sources 2016. I’m directing Navy Department Energy Agriculture work private sector create advanced biofuels power fighter jets, trucks commercial airliners. there’s reason shouldn’t using renewable fuels America. that’s we’re investing like fueling stations research generation biofuels. biggest problems alternative energy producing energy, distributing it. We’ve gas stations country, need gas know -- doesn’t matter are. Well, we’ve kind distribution network comes renewable energy sources converting kind car runs kind energy, you’re going able convenience. Otherwise, market won’t work; won’t grow. years, we’ll help entrepreneurs break ground next-generation biorefineries -- capacity 20 million gallons year. going forward, look ways reform biofuels incentives sure they’re meeting today’s challenges they’re saving taxpayers money. replace oil fuels like natural gas biofuels, reduce dependence making cars trucks oil place. Seventy percent petroleum consumption goes transportation -- 70 percent. way, second biggest chunk families’ budgets goes transportation. that’s best ways economy dependent oil save folks money transportation sector efficient. Now, went 30 years didn’t raise fuel efficiency standards cars. happened U.S. auto industry oil cheap, U.S. auto industry decided we’re going money SUVs, we’re going worry fuel efficiency. Thirty years lost time comes technology improve efficiency cars. year, established groundbreaking national fuel efficiency standard cars trucks. year legislation. parties agree -- automakers, autoworkers, environmental groups, industry. means cars gas mileage, saving 1.8 billion barrels oil life program -- 1.8 billion. consumers save money trips pump -- $3,000 average time save higher fuel efficiency standards. automakers build innovative products. Right now, cars rolling assembly lines Detroit combustion engines -- I’m talking hybrids -- combustion engines 50 miles gallon. know it. know cars efficient. going forward, we’re going continue work automakers, autoworkers, states, ensure high-quality, fuel-efficient cars trucks tomorrow built right United States America. That’s going priority us. summer, we’re going propose first-ever fuel efficiency standards heavy-duty trucks. fall, we’ll announce round fuel standards cars builds we’ve done. way, federal government going need lead example. fleet cars trucks federal government largest country. We’ve cars. that’s we’ve doubled number alternative vehicles federal fleet. that’s today directing agencies purchase 100 percent alternative fuel, hybrid, electric vehicles 2015. alternative fuel. Going forward, we’ll partner private companies want upgrade large fleets. means, way, students, consumers future consumers cars, you’ve sure boosting demand alternative vehicles. You’re going responsibility well, alternative-fuel vehicles manufactured guys aren’t buying them, folks making cars don’t fuel efficiency. you’ve power process, decisions individually lives say comes energy independence. We’ve historic investments high-speed rail mass transit, making transportation sector cleaner efficient involves offering Americans, urban, suburban, rural, choice mobile car pay gas. Still, breakthroughs promising increasing fuel efficiency reducing dependence oil electric vehicles. Soon took office, set goal million electric vehicles roads 2015. We’ve created incentives American companies develop vehicles, Americans want buy them. new manufacturing plants opening years. modest $2 billion investment competitive grants companies develop generation batteries cars jumpstarted big new American industry. Pretty soon, America home 40 percent global manufacturing capacity advanced batteries. wondering means, that’s holding electric vehicles battery stores electricity, energy. efficient, lightweight batteries, easier manufacture cars competitive price. industry United States America, means jobs. batteries here, cars here. cars here, we’re putting Americans work. Now, sure stay goal we’re going need -- offering powerful incentives consumers, rewarding communities pave way adoption vehicles. Now, electric cars -- don't need talk Chu -- turns electric cars run electricity. reduce oil dependency, we’re producing great electric cars, we’re going plan change way generate electricity America it’s cleaner safer healthier. know ushering clean energy economy potential creating untold numbers new jobs new businesses right United States. we’re going think produce electricity efficiently. Now, addition producing it, actually think making sure we’re wasting energy. don't know we’re Georgetown campus, Mr. President, institution household start thinking reducing energy we’re using efficient ways. Today, homes businesses consume 40 percent energy use, costs billions dollars energy bills. Manufacturers require large amounts energy products, they're challenged rising energy costs. can’t separate issue oil dependence issue producing generally -- energy generally. that’s we’ve proposed new programs help Americans upgrade homes businesses plants new, energy-efficient building materials -- new lighting, new windows, new heating cooling systems -- investments save consumers business owners tens billions dollars year, free money investment hiring creating new jobs hiring workers putting contractors work well. nice energy efficiency technology. don’t create new. help businesses homeowners place installation, energy-efficient windows, energy-efficient lighting. They’ll money back. save money electricity pays improvements made, people money front, we’ve incentives that. like fuels cars, we’re going cleaner renewable sources electricity. Today, two-fifths electricity come clean energy sources. that. think right incentives place, double clean energy. that’s why, State Union address January, called new Clean Energy Standard America: 2035, 80 percent electricity needs come wide range clean energy sources -- renewables like wind solar, efficient natural gas. And, yes, we’re going examine clean coal nuclear power work. Now, light ongoing events Japan, want minute talk nuclear power. Right now, America one-fifth electricity nuclear energy. it’s important recognize nuclear energy doesn’t emit carbon dioxide atmosphere. concerned climate change, we’ve recognize nuclear power, it’s safe, significant contribution climate change question. I’m determined ensure it’s safe. light what’s happened Japan, I’ve requested comprehensive safety review Nuclear Regulatory Commission sure existing nuclear energy facilities safe. we’re going incorporate conclusions lessons Japan design building generation plants. can’t simply table. administration leading global discussions new international framework countries operating nuclear plants making sure they’re spreading dangerous nuclear materials technology. broadly, clean energy standard expand scope clean energy investments gives cutting-edge companies certainty need invest. Essentially says companies, know what, customer you’re producing clean energy. Utilities, need buy clean energy portfolio, means innovators willing big capital investments. we’ve start -- think -- 1980s, America home 80 percent world’s wind capacity, 90 percent world’s solar capacity. leaders wind. leaders solar. clean energy economy ‘80s. Guess what. Today, China wind capacity. Germany solar capacity. invest clean energy do, larger economy substantially larger user energy.

I’ve seen scientists searching big breakthrough energy. happened government support. understand we’ve tight fiscal situation, it’s fair ask pay government’s investment energy. debate national priorities budget Congress, we’re going tough choices. We’re going cut don’t need invest need. Unfortunately, folks want cut critical investments clean energy. want cut research development new technologies. They’re shortchanging resources promptly issue new permits offshore drilling. cuts eliminate thousands private sector jobs; terminate scientists engineers; end fellowships researchers, Georgetown, graduate students talent desperately need area 21st century. doesn’t sense. We’re paying price inaction. time pump, time lose job business countries investing clean energy, comes air, water, climate change threatens planet inherit -- we’re paying price. costs bearing. nothing, price up. moments like these, sacrificing investments research development, supporting clean energy technologies, weaken energy economy dependent oil.

You’ll hear phrase lot. “We need eliminate waste abuse.” implication tackling deficit issue won’t require tough choices. politicians suggest close entire deficit eliminating like foreign aid, foreign makes 1 percent entire federal budget. here’s truth. two-thirds budget -- two-thirds -- spent Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, national security. Two-thirds. Programs like unemploymentinsurance, student loans, veterans’ benefits, tax credits working families 20 percent. What’s left, debt, 12 percent else.

Today want clear priority translated concrete actions, supported diplomatic, economic strategic tools disposal. Let specific. First, policy United States promote reform region, support transitions democracy. effort begins Egypt Tunisia, stakes high -- Tunisia vanguard democratic wave, Egypt longstanding partner Arab world’s largest nation. nations set strong example free fair elections, vibrant civil society, accountable effective democratic institutions, responsible regional leadership. support extend nations transitions place. Unfortunately, countries, calls change far answered violence. extreme example Libya, Muammar Qaddafi launched war people, promising hunt like rats. United States joined international coalition intervene, prevent injustice perpetrated regime people, learned experience Iraq costly difficult try impose regime change force -- matter well-intentioned be. Libya, saw prospect imminent massacre, mandate action, heard Libyan people’s help. acted NATO allies regional coalition partners, thousands killed. message clear: power killing people takes. Now, time working Qaddafi. control country. opposition organized legitimate credible Interim Council. Qaddafi inevitably leaves forced power, decades provocation come end, transition democratic Libya proceed. Libya faced violence greatest scale, it’s place leaders turned repression remain power. recently, Syrian regime chosen path murder mass arrests citizens. United States condemned actions, working international community stepped sanctions Syrian regime -- including sanctions announced yesterday Assad him. Syrian people shown courage demanding transition democracy. Assad choice: lead transition, way. Syrian government shooting demonstrators allow peaceful protests. release political prisoners unjust arrests. allow human rights monitors access cities like Dara’a; start dialogue advance democratic transition. Otherwise, Assad regime continue challenged continue isolated abroad. far, Syria followed Iranian ally, seeking assistance Tehran tactics suppression. speaks hypocrisy Iranian regime, says stand rights protesters abroad, represses people home. Let’s remember peaceful protests region streets Tehran, government brutalized women men, threw innocent people jail. hear chants echo rooftops Tehran. image young woman dying streets seared memory. continue insist Iranian people deserve universal rights, government smother aspirations. Now, opposition Iran’s intolerance Iran’s repressive measures, illicit nuclear program support terror, known. America credible, acknowledge times friends region reacted demands consistent change -- change that’s consistent principles I’ve outlined today. That’s true Yemen, Saleh needs follow commitment transfer power. that’s true today Bahrain. Bahrain longstanding partner, committed security. recognize Iran tried advantage turmoil there, Bahraini government legitimate rule law. Nevertheless, insisted publicly privately mass arrests brute force odds universal rights Bahrain’s citizens, -- steps legitimate calls reform away. way forward government opposition engage dialogue, can’t real dialogue parts peaceful opposition jail. government create conditions dialogue, opposition participate forge future Bahrainis. Indeed, broader lessons drawn period sectarian divides need lead conflict. Iraq, promise multiethnic, multi-sectarian democracy. Iraqi people rejected perils political violence favor democratic process, they’ve taken responsibility security. course, like new democracies, face setbacks. Iraq poised play key role region continues peaceful progress. do, proud stand steadfast partner. months ahead, America influence encourage reform region. acknowledge country different, need speak honestly principles believe in, friend foe alike. message simple: risks reform entails, support United States. build efforts broaden engagement elites, reach people shape future -- young people. continue commitments Cairo -- build networks entrepreneurs expand exchanges education, foster cooperation science technology, combat disease. region, intend assistance civil society, including officially sanctioned, speak uncomfortable truths. technology connect -- listen -- voices people. is, real reform come ballot box alone. efforts support basic rights speak mind access information. support open access Internet, right journalists heard -- it’s big news organization lone blogger. 21st century, power, truth hidden, legitimacy governments ultimately depend active informed citizens. open discourse important square worldview. Let clear, America respects right peaceful law-abiding voices heard, disagree them. profoundly disagree them. look forward working embrace genuine inclusive democracy. oppose attempt group restrict rights others, hold power coercion consent. democracy depends elections, strong accountable institutions, respect rights minorities. tolerance important comes religion. Tahrir Square, heard Egyptians walks life chant, “Muslims, Christians, one.” America work spirit prevails -- faiths respected, bridges built them. region birthplace world religions, intolerance lead suffering stagnation. season change succeed, Coptic Christians right worship freely Cairo, Shia mosques destroyed Bahrain. true religious minorities true comes rights women. History shows countries prosperous peaceful women empowered. that’s continue insist universal rights apply women men -- focusing assistance child maternal health; helping women teach, start business; standing right women voices heard, run office. region reach potential half population prevented achieving potential. Now, promote political reform, promote human rights region, efforts can’t there. second way support positive change region efforts advance economic development nations transitioning democracy. all, politics protesters streets. tipping point people constant concern putting food table family. people region wake expectations making day, hoping luck change. region, young people solid education, closed economies leave unable job. Entrepreneurs brimming ideas, corruption leaves unable profit ideas. greatest untapped resource Middle East North Africa talent people. recent protests, talent display, people harness technology world.

So, drawing we’ve learned world, think it’s important focus trade, aid; investment, assistance. goal model protectionism gives way openness, reigns commerce pass many, economy generates jobs young. America’s support democracy based ensuring financial stability, promoting reform, integrating competitive markets global economy. we’re going start Tunisia Egypt. First, we’ve asked World Bank International Monetary Fund present plan week’s G8 summit needs stabilize modernize economies Tunisia Egypt. Together, help recover disruptions democratic upheaval, support governments elected later year. urging countries help Egypt Tunisia meet near-term financial needs.

Third, we’re working Congress create Enterprise Funds invest Tunisia Egypt. modeled funds supported transitions Eastern Europe fall Berlin Wall.

EU membership served incentive reform Europe, vision modern prosperous economy create powerful force reform Middle East North Africa. Prosperity requires tearing walls stand way progress -- corruption elites steal people; red tape stops idea business; patronage distributes wealth based tribe sect. help governments meet international obligations, invest efforts anti-corruption -- working parliamentarians developing reforms, activists technology increase transparency hold government accountable. Politics human rights; economic reform. Let conclude talking cornerstone approach region, relates pursuit peace. decades, conflict Israelis Arabs cast shadow region. Israelis, meant living fear children blown bus rockets fired homes, pain knowing children region taught hate them. Palestinians, meant suffering humiliation occupation, living nation own. Moreover, conflict come larger cost Middle East, impedes partnerships bring greater security prosperity empowerment ordinary people. years, administration worked parties international community end conflict, building decades work previous administrations. expectations unmet.

Indeed, argue change uncertainty region, simply possible forward now. disagree. time people Middle East North Africa casting burdens past, drive lasting peace ends conflict resolves claims urgent ever. That’s certainly true parties involved. Palestinians, efforts delegitimize Israel end failure. Symbolic actions isolate Israel United Nations September won’t create independent state. Palestinian leaders achieve peace prosperity Hamas insists path terror rejection. Palestinians realize independence denying right Israel exist. Israel, friendship rooted deeply shared history shared values. commitment Israel’s security unshakeable. stand attempts single criticism international forums. precisely friendship, it’s important tell truth: status quo unsustainable, Israel act boldly advance lasting peace. is, growing number Palestinians live west Jordan River. Technology harder Israel defend itself. region undergoing profound change lead populism millions people -- leaders -- believe peace possible. international community tired endless process produces outcome. dream Jewish democratic state fulfilled permanent occupation. Now, ultimately, Israelis Palestinians action. peace imposed -- United States; else. endless delay won’t problem away.

Now, debt ceiling debate, hoped negotiate compromise Speaker House fulfilled principles achieved $4 trillion deficit reduction leaders parties agreed need -- grand bargain strengthened economy, weakened it. Unfortunately, Speaker walked away balanced package. agreed wasn’t grand. start -- roughly $1 trillion cuts domestic spending defense spending. knows more, special joint committee Congress assigned deficit reduction. So, today, I’m laying set specific proposals finish started summer -- proposals live principles I’ve talked beginning. It’s plan reduces debt $4 trillion, achieves savings way fair -- asking bear burden own. told, plan cuts $2 spending dollar new revenues. addition $1 trillion spending we’ve cut budget, plan makes additional spending cuts need happen we’re solve problem. reform agricultural subsidies -- subsidies times pay large farms crops don't grow. modest adjustments federal retirement programs. reduce tens billions dollars tax money goes Fannie Mae Freddie Mac. ask largest financial firms -- companies tax dollars financial crisis -- repay American people dime spent. save additional $1 trillion end wars Iraq Afghanistan. savings counted plan, budget plan nearly Republican House voted for. Finally, plan includes structural reforms reduce cost health care programs like Medicare Medicaid. mind we've included number reforms health care law, long way controlling costs. we're going little more. plan reduces wasteful subsidies erroneous payments changing incentives lead excessive health care costs. makes prescriptions affordable faster approval generic drugs. We’ll work governors Medicaid efficient accountable. we’ll change way pay health care. paying procedures, providers paid improve results -- steps save money improve care. changes phased slowly strengthen Medicare Medicaid time. need reduce health care costs, I’m going allow excuse turning Medicare voucher program leaves seniors mercy insurance industry.

I've before, Social Security primary cause deficits, face long-term challenges country grows older. parties going need work separate track strengthen Social Security children grandchildren. reduce spending: scouring budget dime waste inefficiency, reforming government spending, making modest adjustments Medicare Medicaid. reductions spending, themselves, solve fiscal problems. can’t cut way hole. It’s going balanced approach. we’re going spending cuts -- wouldn’t weren’t facing large budget deficits -- it’s right ask pay fair share. know, week, Speaker House John Boehner gave speech economy. credit, point can’t afford kind politics says it’s “my way highway.” encouraged that. Here’s problem: speech, came plan cut deficit includes additional revenues whatsoever. -- I'm quoting -- “only option.” option option relies entirely cuts. means slashing education, surrendering research America’s technological edge 21st century, allowing critical public assets like highways bridges airports worse. cripple competiveness ability win jobs future. mean asking sacrifice seniors middle class poor, asking wealthiest Americans biggest corporations. Speaker says can’t ""my way highway,"" basically says, way -- highway. That’s smart. It’s right. we’re going meet responsibilities, together. Now, I’m proposing real, cuts spending. include $1 trillion cuts I’ve signed law, biggest cuts spending history. they’ve larger plan that’s balanced –- plan asks fortunate pay fair share, like else. that’s plan eliminates tax loopholes primarily wealthiest taxpayers biggest corporations –- tax breaks small businesses middle-class families don’t get. tax reform doesn't done, plan asks wealthiest Americans paying rates paid 1990s, Bush tax cuts. promise it’s looks forward prospects raising taxes paying taxes. don’t. fact, I’ve cut taxes middle class small businesses, American Jobs Act, we’d cut taxes promote hiring money pockets people. can’t afford special lower rates wealthy -– rates, way, meant temporary. -- tax cuts, 2001, 2003, talked about, talked temporary measures. can’t afford we’re running big deficits. Now, ready work Democrats Republicans reform entire tax code, rid decades accumulated loopholes, special carve-outs, tax expenditures stack deck small business owners ordinary families can’t afford Washington lobbyists fancy accountants. tax code 10,000 pages long. stack volumes, they’re feet tall. means pay depends game system, that's especially true corporate tax code. We’ve highest corporate tax rates world, it’s riddled exceptions special loopholes. companies paying taxes, rest end foot bill. makes entire economy competitive country desirable place business. change. tax code shouldn’t advantage companies best-connected lobbyists. advantage companies invest United States America create jobs United States America. lower corporate rate rid special deals. ready, eager, work Democrats Republicans reform tax code simpler, fairer, America competitive. reform plan raise revenue help close deficit. formula. reform follow simple principle: Middle-class families shouldn’t pay higher taxes millionaires billionaires. That’s pretty straightforward. It’s hard argue that. Warren Buffett’s secretary shouldn’t pay higher tax rate Warren Buffett. justification it. wrong United States America, teacher nurse construction worker earns $50,000 pay higher tax rates pulling $50 million. says can’t change tax code correct that, signed pledge protect single tax loophole long live, called out. defend unfairness -- explain who's making $50 million year financial markets paying 15 percent taxes, teacher making $50,000 year paying -- paying higher rate. answer it. they’re pledged kind unfairness place, remember, time checked pledge matters pledge uphold Constitution. Now, we’re hearing usual defenders kinds loopholes saying “class warfare.” reject idea asking hedge fund manager pay tax rate plumber teacher class warfare. think it’s right do. believe American middle class, who've pressured relentlessly decades, believe it’s time fought hard lobbyists lawmakers fought protect special treatment billionaires big corporations. wants punish success America. What’s great country belief able try -– idea open business idea millionaires billionaires. land opportunity. That’s great. I’m saying well, including me, pay fair share taxes contribute nation success possible. shouldn’t deal ordinary families get. think wealthy Americans agree knew help grow economy deal debt threatens future. comes this: prioritize. parties agree need reduce deficit -- $4 trillion. choices going reach goal? ask wealthiest Americans pay fair share taxes, we’re going ask seniors pay Medicare. can’t afford both. gut education medical research, we’ve reform tax code profitable corporations tax loopholes companies don’t get. can’t afford both. class warfare. It’s math. money going come someplace. we’re willing ask who've extraordinarily help America close deficit trying reach target $4 trillion, logic, math says more: We’ve entire burden middle class poor. We’ve scale investments helped economy grow. We’ve settle second-rate roads second-rate bridges second-rate airports, schools crumbling. That’s unacceptable me. That’s unacceptable American people. happen watch. support -- support -- plan puts burden closing deficit ordinary Americans. veto changes benefits rely Medicare raise revenues asking wealthiest Americans biggest corporations pay fair share. going one-sided deal hurts folks vulnerable. changes I’m proposing easy politically convenient.

Now, debate, suffering kind collective amnesia. that’s happened, worst economic crisis, worst financial crisis Great Depression, want return practices mess. fact, want policies stacked deck middle-class Americans way years. philosophy simple: left fend play rules. say wrong. I’m Kansas reaffirm deep conviction we’re greater own. believe country succeeds fair shot, fair share, plays rules. aren’t Democratic values Republican values. aren’t 1 percent values 99 percent values. They’re American values. reclaim them. see, isn’t time America faced choice. turn century, nation farmers transitioning world’s industrial giant, decide: settle country new railroads factories controlled giant monopolies kept prices high wages low? allow citizens children work ungodly hours conditions unsafe unsanitary? restrict education privileged few? people thought massive inequality exploitation people price pay progress. Theodore Roosevelt disagreed. Republican son wealthy family. praised titans industry create jobs grow economy. believed know true today, free market greatest force economic progress human history.

Roosevelt knew free market free license can. understood free market works rules road ensure competition fair open honest. busted monopolies, forcing companies compete consumers services prices. today, must. fought sure businesses couldn’t profit exploiting children selling food medicine wasn’t safe. today, can’t. 1910,Teddy Roosevelt came Osawatomie laid vision called New Nationalism. “Our country,” said, “...means means triumph real democracy...of economic man guaranteed opportunity best him.” Now, this, Roosevelt called radical. called socialist -- communist. today, richer nation stronger democracy fought campaign: eight-hour work day minimum wage women -- insurance unemployed elderly, disabilities; political reform progressive income tax. Today, 100 years later, economy transformation. decades, huge advances technology allowed businesses less, it’s easier set shop hire workers want world. know firsthand painful disruptions caused Americans. Factories people thought retire suddenly picked went overseas, workers cheaper. Steel mills needed 100 -- 1,000 employees able work 100 employees, layoffs permanent, temporary business cycle. changes didn’t affect blue-collar workers. bank teller phone operator travel agent, saw profession replaced ATMs Internet. Today, higher-skilled jobs, like accountants middle management outsourced countries like China India. you’re job cheaper computer country, don’t leverage employer comes asking wages benefits, especially Americans today union. Now, Teddy Roosevelt’s time, crowd Washington who, decades, said, let’s respond economic challenge old tune. “The market care everything,” tell us. cut regulations cut taxes -- especially wealthy -- economy grow stronger. Sure, say, winners losers. winners well, jobs prosperity eventually trickle else. And, argue, prosperity doesn’t trickle down, well, that’s price liberty. Now, it’s simple theory. admit, it’s speaks rugged individualism healthy skepticism government. That’s America’s DNA. theory fits bumper sticker. here’s problem: doesn’t work. worked. didn’t work tried decade Great Depression. It’s led incredible postwar booms ‘50s ‘60s. didn’t work tried decade. mean, understand, it’s haven’t tried theory. Remember years, 2001 2003, Congress passed expensive tax cuts wealthy history. us? slowest job growth half century. Massive deficits harder pay investments built country basic security helped millions Americans reach stay middle class -- like education infrastructure, science technology, Medicare Social Security. Remember years, folks running Congress, weak regulation, little oversight, us? Insurance companies jacked people’s premiums impunity denied care patients sick, mortgage lenders tricked families buying homes couldn’t afford, financial sector irresponsibility lack basic oversight nearly destroyed entire economy. simply return brand “you’re own” economics we’re rebuilding middle class country. know doesn’t result strong economy. results economy invests little people future. know doesn’t result prosperity trickles down. results prosperity that’s enjoyed citizens. Look statistics. decades, average income 1 percent 250 percent 1.2 million dollars year. I’m talking millionaires, people million dollars. I’m saying people million dollars single year. hundredth 1 percent, average income 27 million dollars year. typical CEO earn 30 times worker earns 110 times more. yet, decade incomes Americans actually fallen 6 percent. Now, kind inequality -- level haven’t seen Great Depression -- hurts all. middle-class families longer afford buy goods services businesses selling, people slipping middle class, drags entire economy bottom. America built idea broad-based prosperity, strong consumers country. That’s CEO like Henry Ford mission pay workers buy cars made. It’s recent study showed countries inequality tend stronger steadier economic growth long run. Inequality distorts democracy. gives outsized voice afford high-priced lobbyists unlimited campaign contributions, runs risk selling democracy highest bidder. leaves rightly suspicious Washington rigged them, elected representatives aren’t looking interests Americans. there’s fundamental issue stake. kind gaping inequality gives lie promise that’s heart America: place try. tell people -- tell kids -- country, you’re born nothing, work hard middle class. tell children chance do. That’s immigrants world historically flocked shores. yet, decades, rungs ladder opportunity grown farther farther apart, middle class shrunk. know, years World War II, child born poverty slightly 50-50 chance middle class adult. 1980, chance fallen 40 percent. trend rising inequality decades continues, it’s estimated child born today one-in-three chance making middle class -- 33 percent. It’s heartbreaking millions working families country forced children food banks decent meal. idea children chance climb situation middle class, matter hard work? That’s inexcusable. wrong. flies face stand for.

It’s important role democracy role citizen. indeed, 225 years ago today Constitutional Convention opened Philadelphia, founders, citizens all, began crafting extraordinary document. Yes, flaws -- flaws nation strived protect (perfect) time.

American history, though, lost bet, believe time well. ultimately, Class 2012, depend you. Don’t wait person speak what’s right. maybe, maybe, they’re waiting you. brings second piece advice: underestimate power example. graduating, let women graduate college men, possible earlier generations women -- mothers, grandmothers, aunts -- shattered myth couldn’t shouldn’t are. think friend who’s daughter immigrants. high school, guidance counselor told her, know what, you’re college material. think secretary.

I’m calling Congress pass specific proposals right away. First: It’s time Congress require universal background check trying buy gun. law requires licensed gun dealers run background checks, 14 years that’s kept 1.5 million wrong people hands gun. it’s hard enforce law 40 percent gun purchases conducted background check. That’s safe. That's smart. It’s fair responsible gun buyers sellers. want buy gun -- it’s licensed dealer private seller -- felon legally prohibited buying one. common sense. overwhelming majority Americans agree need universal background checks -- including 70 percent National Rifle Association’s members, according survey. there’s reason can’t this. Second: Congress restore ban military-style assault weapons, 10-round limit magazines. type assault rifle Aurora, example, paired high-capacity magazines, purpose -- pump bullets possible, quickly possible; damage, using bullets designed inflict maximum damage. that's allowed gunman Aurora shoot 70 people -- 70 people -- killing 12 matter minutes. Weapons designed theater war place movie theater. majority Americans agree this. And, way, Ronald Reagan, staunchest defenders Second Amendment, wrote Congress 1994, urging -- Ronald Reagan speaking -- urging “listen American public law enforcement community support ban manufacture weapons.” finally, Congress needs help, hinder, law enforcement job. tougher people buy guns express purpose turning selling criminals. severely punish helps this. Congress hasn’t confirmed director Bureau Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms years, confirm Todd Jones, -- Acting, nominating post. time budget cuts forcing communities reduce police force, cops job streets. Let absolutely clear. Like Americans, believe Second Amendment guarantees individual right bear arms. respect strong tradition gun ownership rights hunters sportsmen. millions responsible, law-abiding gun owners America cherish right bear arms hunting, sport, protection, collection. believe gun owners agree respect Second Amendment keeping irresponsible, law-breaking inflicting harm massive scale. believe agree America worked harder guns hands dangerous people, atrocities like occurred Newtown.

Instead, we’ve seen emergence Qaeda affiliates. Yemen Iraq, Somalia North Africa, threat today diffuse, Qaeda’s affiliates Arabian Peninsula -- AQAP -- active plotting homeland. AQAP’s efforts approach scale 9/11, continued plot acts terror, like attempt blow airplane Christmas Day 2009.

Nevertheless, ideology persists, age ideas images travel globe instant, response terrorism can’t depend military law enforcement alone. need elements national power win battle wills, battle ideas. want discuss today components comprehensive counterterrorism strategy.

Don’t word it. intelligence gathered bin Laden’s compound, wrote, “We lose reserves enemy’s air strikes. fight air strikes explosives.” communications Qaeda operatives confirm well. Dozens highly skilled Qaeda commanders, trainers, bomb makers operatives taken battlefield. Plots disrupted targeted international aviation, U.S. transit systems, European cities troops Afghanistan. Simply put, strikes lives. Moreover, America’s actions legal. attacked 9/11. week, Congress overwhelmingly authorized force. domestic law, international law, United States war Qaeda, Taliban, associated forces. war organization right kill Americans first. war -- war waged proportionally, resort, self-defense. yet, fight enters new phase, America’s legitimate claim self-defense end discussion. say military tactic legal, effective, say wise moral instance. human progress gives technology strike half world away demands discipline constrain power -- risk abusing it. that’s why, years, administration worked vigorously establish framework governs force terrorists –- insisting clear guidelines, oversight accountability codified Presidential Policy Guidance signed yesterday. Afghan war theater, -- -- continue support troops transition complete end 2014. means continue strikes high value Qaeda targets, forces massing support attacks coalition forces. end 2014, longer need force protection, progress we’ve core Qaeda reduce need unmanned strikes. Afghan theater, target Qaeda associated forces. then, drones heavily constrained. America strikes ability capture individual terrorists; preference detain, interrogate, prosecute. America strikes choose; actions bound consultations partners, respect state sovereignty. America strikes punish individuals; act terrorists pose continuing imminent threat American people, governments capable effectively addressing threat. strike taken, near-certainty civilians killed injured -- highest standard set. Now, point critical, criticism drone strikes -- home abroad -- understandably centers reports civilian casualties. There’s wide gap U.S. assessments casualties nongovernmental reports. Nevertheless, hard U.S. strikes resulted civilian casualties, risk exists war. families civilians, words legal construct justify loss. me, chain command, deaths haunt long live, haunted civilian casualties occurred conventional fighting Afghanistan Iraq. Commander-in-Chief, weigh heartbreaking tragedies alternatives. face terrorist networks invite far civilian casualties-- cities home facilities abroad, places like Sana’a Kabul Mogadishu terrorists seek foothold. Remember terrorists target civilians, death toll acts terrorism Muslims dwarfs estimate civilian casualties drone strikes. option. foreign governments effectively terrorism territory, primary alternative targeted lethal action conventional military options. I’ve said, small special operations carry enormous risks. Conventional airpower missiles far precise drones, likely cause civilian casualties local outrage. invasions territories lead viewed occupying armies, unleash torrent unintended consequences, difficult contain, result large numbers civilian casualties ultimately empower thrive violent conflict. false assert putting boots ground likely result civilian deaths likely create enemies Muslim world. results U.S. deaths, Black Hawks down, confrontations local populations, inevitable mission creep support raids easily escalate new wars.

Now, say risks real. U.S. military action foreign lands risks creating enemies impacts public opinion overseas. Moreover, laws constrain power wartime, taken oath defend Constitution United States. precision drone strikes secrecy involved actions end shielding government public scrutiny troop deployment invites. lead team view drone strikes cure-all terrorism. reason, I’ve insisted strong oversight lethal action. took office, administration began briefing strikes Iraq Afghanistan committees Congress. Let repeat that: Congress authorize force, briefed strike America takes. strike. includes instance targeted American citizen -- Anwar Awlaki, chief external operations AQAP. week, authorized declassification action, deaths Americans drone strikes, facilitate transparency debate issue dismiss outlandish claims made. record, believe constitutional government target kill U.S. citizen -- drone, shotgun -- process, deploy armed drones U.S. soil. U.S. citizen goes abroad wage war America actively plotting kill U.S. citizens, United States, partners position capture carries plot, citizenship serve shield sniper shooting innocent crowd protected SWAT team. That’s Anwar Awlaki -- continuously trying kill people. helped oversee 2010 plot detonate explosive devices U.S.-bound cargo planes. involved planning blow airliner 2009. Farouk Abdulmutallab -- Christmas Day bomber -- went Yemen 2009, Awlaki hosted him, approved suicide operation, helped tape martyrdom video shown attack, instructions blow airplane American soil. detained prosecuted Awlaki captured carried plot, couldn’t. President, derelict duty authorized strike took out. course, targeting American raises constitutional issues present strikes -- administration submitted Awlaki Department Justice months Awlaki killed, briefed Congress strike well. high threshold we’ve set taking lethal action applies potential terrorist targets, regardless American citizens. threshold respects inherent dignity human life. decision men women uniform harm’s way, decision force individuals groups -- sworn enemy United States -- hardest President. decisions made, given responsibility protect American people. Going forward, I’ve asked administration review proposals extend oversight lethal actions warzones reporting Congress. option virtues theory, poses difficulties practice. example, establishment special court evaluate authorize lethal action benefit bringing branch government process, raises constitutional issues presidential judicial authority. idea that’s suggested -- establishment independent oversight board executive branch -- avoids problems, introduce layer bureaucracy national security decision-making, inspiring additional public confidence process. challenges, look forward actively engaging Congress explore options increased oversight. believe, however, force seen larger discussion need comprehensive counterterrorism strategy -- focus force, force safe. force radical ideology takes root; absence strategy reduces wellspring extremism, perpetual war -- drones Special Forces troop deployments -- prove self-defeating, alter country troubling ways. element strategy involves addressing underlying grievances conflicts feed extremism -- North Africa South Asia. we’ve learned past decade, vast complex undertaking. humble expectation quickly resolve deep-rooted problems like poverty sectarian hatred. Moreover, countries alike, undergo chaotic change better. security values demand effort. means patiently supporting transitions democracy places like Egypt Tunisia Libya -- peaceful realization individual aspirations serve rebuke violent extremists. strengthen opposition Syria, isolating extremist elements -- end tyrant way tyranny terrorism. actively working promote peace Israelis Palestinians -- right peace help reshape attitudes region. help countries modernize economies, upgrade education, encourage entrepreneurship -- American leadership elevated ability connect people’s hopes, simply fears. success fronts requires sustained engagement, require resources. know foreign popular expenditures is. That’s true Democrats Republicans -- I’ve seen polling -- amounts percent federal budget. fact, folks think it’s 25 percent, ask people streets. percent -- wildly unpopular. foreign assistance viewed charity. fundamental national security. it’s fundamental sensible long-term strategy battle extremism. Moreover, foreign assistance tiny fraction spend fighting wars assistance ultimately prevent. spent month Iraq height war, training security forces Libya, maintaining peace agreements Israel neighbors, feeding hungry Yemen, building schools Pakistan, creating reservoirs goodwill marginalize extremists. strategy. Moreover, America carry work don’t diplomats serving dangerous places. past decade, strengthened security embassies, implementing recommendation Accountability Review Board, unacceptable failures Benghazi. I’ve called Congress fully fund efforts bolster security harden facilities, improve intelligence, facilitate quicker response time military crisis emerges. steps, irreducible risks diplomats remain. price world’s powerful nation, wave change washes Arab World. balancing trade4offs security active diplomacy, firmly believe retreat challenging regions increase dangers face long run. that's grateful diplomats willing serve. Targeted action terrorists, effective partnerships, diplomatic engagement assistance -- comprehensive strategy significantly reduce chances large-scale attacks homeland mitigate threats Americans overseas. guard dangers abroad, neglect daunting challenge terrorism borders. earlier, threat new. technology Internet increase frequency cases lethality. Today, person consume hateful propaganda, commit violent agenda, learn kill leaving home. address threat, years ago administration comprehensive review engaged law enforcement. best way prevent violent extremism inspired violent jihadists work Muslim American community -- consistently rejected terrorism -- identify signs radicalization partner law enforcement individual drifting violence. partnerships work recognize Muslims fundamental American family. fact, success American Muslims determination guard encroachments civil liberties ultimate rebuke say we’re war Islam. Thwarting homegrown plots presents challenges proud commitment civil liberties America home. That’s why, years come, working hard strike balance need security preserving freedoms are. means reviewing authorities law enforcement, intercept new types communication, build privacy protections prevent abuse. means -- Boston -- deport throw prison absence evidence. means putting careful constraints tools government uses protect sensitive information, state secrets doctrine. means finally strong Privacy Civil Liberties Board review issues counterterrorism efforts values come tension. Justice Department’s investigation national security leaks offers recent example challenges involved striking right balance security open society. Commander-in-Chief, believe secret protects operations people field. so, enforce consequences break law breach commitment protect classified information. free press essential democracy. That’s are. I’m troubled possibility leak investigations chill investigative journalism holds government accountable. Journalists legal risk jobs. focus break law. that’s I’ve called Congress pass media shield law guard government overreach. I’ve raised issues Attorney General, shares concerns. agreed review existing Department Justice guidelines governing investigations involve reporters, he’ll convene group media organizations hear concerns review. I’ve directed Attorney General report July 12th. Now, issues remind choices war impact -- unintended ways -- openness freedom way life depends. intend engage Congress existing Authorization Military Force, AUMF, determine continue fight terrorism keeping America perpetual wartime footing. AUMF nearly 12 years old. Afghan war coming end. Core Qaeda shell self. Groups like AQAP dealt with, years come, collection thugs labels Qaeda pose credible threat United States. discipline thinking, definitions, actions, drawn wars don’t need fight, continue grant Presidents unbound powers suited traditional armed conflicts nation states. look forward engaging Congress American people efforts refine, ultimately repeal, AUMF’s mandate. sign laws designed expand mandate further. systematic effort dismantle terrorist organizations continue. war, like wars, end. That’s history advises. That’s democracy demands. brings final topic: detention terrorist suspects. I’m going repeat time: matter policy, preference United States capture terrorist suspects. detain suspect, interrogate them. suspect prosecuted, decide try civilian court military commission. past decade, vast majority detained military captured battlefield. Iraq, turned thousands prisoners ended war. Afghanistan, transitioned detention facilities Afghans, process restoring Afghan sovereignty. bring law war detention end, committed prosecuting terrorists can. glaring exception time-tested approach detention center Guantanamo Bay. original premise opening GTMO -- detainees able challenge detention -- unconstitutional years ago. meantime, GTMO symbol world America flouts rule law. allies won’t cooperate think terrorist end GTMO. time budget cuts, spend $150 million year imprison 166 people -- $1 million prisoner. Department Defense estimates spend $200 million GTMO open time we’re cutting investments education research home, Pentagon struggling sequester budget cuts. President, tried close GTMO. transferred 67 detainees countries Congress imposed restrictions effectively prevent transferring detainees countries imprisoning United States. restrictions sense. all, Bush, 530 detainees transferred GTMO Congress’s support. ran time, John McCain supported closing GTMO -- bipartisan issue. person escaped super-max military prisons United States -- ever. courts convicted hundreds people terrorism terrorism-related offenses, including folks dangerous GTMO detainees. They're prisons. given administration’s relentless pursuit Qaeda’s leadership, justification politics Congress prevent closing facility opened. Today, Congress lift restrictions detainee transfers GTMO. asked Department Defense designate site United States hold military commissions. I’m appointing new senior envoy State Department Defense Department sole responsibility achieve transfer detainees countries. lifting moratorium detainee transfers Yemen review case-by-case basis. greatest extent possible, transfer detainees cleared countries. appropriate, bring terrorists justice courts military justice system. insist judicial review detainee. Now, steps issue remain -- deal GTMO detainees know participated dangerous plots attacks prosecuted, example, evidence compromised inadmissible court law. commit process closing GTMO, confident legacy problem resolved, consistent commitment rule law. know politics hard. history cast harsh judgment aspect fight terrorism fail end it. Imagine future -- 10 years 20 years -- United States America holding people charged crime piece land country. Look current situation, force-feeding detainees held hunger strike. I'm willing cut young lady interrupted slack it's worth passionate about. are? Founders foresaw? America want leave children? sense justice stronger that. prosecuted scores terrorists courts. includes Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, tried blow airplane Detroit; Faisal Shahzad, car bomb Times Square. It's court law try Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, accused bombing Boston Marathon. Richard Reid, shoe bomber, is, speak, serving life sentence maximum security prison United States. sentencing Reid, Judge William Young told him, “The way treat you...is measure liberties.” judge sentenced Mr. Reid, shoe bomber, went point American flag flew courtroom. “That flag,” said, “will fly long forgotten. flag stands freedom.” So, America, we’ve faced dangers far greater Qaeda. staying true values founding, using constitutional compass, overcome slavery Civil War fascism communism. years President, I’ve watched American people bounce painful recession, mass shootings, natural disasters like recent tornados devastated Oklahoma. events heartbreaking; shook communities core. resilience American people, events come close breaking us. think Lauren Manning, 9/11 survivor severe burns 80 percent body, said, “That’s reality. Band-Aid it, literally, on.” think New Yorkers filled Times Square day attempted car bomb happened. think proud Pakistani parents who, daughter invited White House, wrote us, “We raised American Muslim daughter dream big pay off.” think wounded warriors rebuilding lives, helping vets jobs. think runner planning 2014 Boston Marathon, said, “Next year, you’re going people ever. Determination messed with.” That’s American people -- determined, messed with. need strategy politics reflects resilient spirit. victory terrorism won’t measured surrender ceremony battleship, statue pulled ground.

That's focus energies months, remainder presidency. plans I'll lay country. won’t able alone, I'm going calling cause. We’ll need businesses, best world, pressure Congress invest future. I’ll asking businesses set example decent wages salaries employees. I’m going highlight ones that. companies like Costco, pays wages offers benefits.

We’ve willing -- we’ve embrace changes cherished priorities work new age. can't -- Democrats can't stand pat defend government doing. believe government middle class fair shot new century -- believe -- we’ve obligation prove it. means we’ve open new ways things. we’ll need Republicans Congress set short-term politics work common ground. It’s interesting, run-up speech, reporters say that, well, Mr. President, ideas, you’ve before; sound great, can't Congress. Republicans won’t agree you. say, look, Republicans Congress right privately agree ideas I’ll proposing. know they’ve so. worry they’ll face swift political retaliation cooperating me. Now, dismiss idea forward they’re playing strident supporters, cases because, sincerely, fundamentally vision America -- says inequality inevitable just; says unfettered free market restraints inevitably produces best outcomes, regardless pain uncertainty imposed ordinary families; government problem shrink small can. case, say members Congress: I’m laying ideas middle class shot. it’s time lay ideas. can't something. something. think I’ve wrong, trends talked happening took office. it’s oppose me. something. ideas? you’re willing work strengthen American manufacturing rebuild country’s infrastructure, let’s go. you’ve ideas bring cost college working families, let’s hear them. think plan making sure American security quality, affordable health care, taking meaningless repeal votes, share concrete ideas country.

First, asked, won’t slippery slope war? man wrote “still recovering involvement Iraq.” veteran bluntly: “This nation sick tired war.” answer simple: American boots ground Syria. pursue open-ended action like Iraq Afghanistan. pursue prolonged air campaign like Libya Kosovo. targeted strike achieve clear objective: deterring chemical weapons, degrading Assad’s capabilities. asked it's worth acting don’t Assad. members Congress said, there’s point simply “pinprick” strike Syria.

Finally, asked: leave countries, seek solutions short force? people wrote me, “We world’s policeman.” agree, deeply held preference peaceful solutions. years, administration tried diplomacy sanctions, warning negotiations -- chemical weapons Assad regime. However, days, we’ve seen encouraging signs. credible threat U.S. military action, constructive talks Putin, Russian government willingness join international community pushing Assad chemical weapons. Assad regime admitted weapons, they’d join Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibits use. It’s early tell offer succeed, agreement verify Assad regime keeps commitments. initiative potential remove threat chemical weapons force, Russia Assad’s strongest allies. have, therefore, asked leaders Congress postpone vote authorize force pursue diplomatic path.

Let specific: faction, party, house Congress, branch government, shut major parts government -- didn’t like law. Republican shutdown happen. want American understand happen. Republicans House Representatives refused fund government defunded dismantled Affordable Care Act.

So, again, urge House Republicans reopen government, restart services Americans depend on, allow public servants home return work. going happen Republicans realize don’t hold entire economy hostage ideological demands. I’ve repeatedly, prepared work Democrats Republicans need grow economy create jobs, fiscal house order long run. add shutdown isn’t deficits, spending, budgets. all, deficits falling fastest pace 50 years. We’ve cut half took office. fact, demands Republicans making actually raise deficits. No, shutdown deficits, it’s budgets. shutdown rolling efforts health insurance folks don’t it. It’s rolling Affordable Care Act. This, else, Republican Party stands days. know it’s strange party keeping people uninsured centerpiece agenda, apparently is. course, what’s stranger shutting government doesn’t accomplish stated goal. Affordable Care Act law passed House; passed Senate. Supreme Court ruled constitutional. central issue year’s election. settled, stay. funding sources, it’s impacted government shutdown. Americans today because, government closed, big Affordable Care Act open business. them, millions like them, historic day reason. It’s long time coming, today, Americans forced insurance visit healthcare.gov enroll affordable new plans offer quality coverage. starts today. people months sign up. months, people going opportunity -- cases, time lives -- affordable coverage desperately need. Now, course, you’re 85 percent Americans health insurance, don’t need thing. You’re benefiting new benefits protections place time law. 15 percent Americans don't health insurance, opportunity life-changing. Let tell folks stories represented today. years ago, Amanda Barrett left job New York care parents. while, temporary insurance covered multiple sclerosis. expired, insurers wouldn’t cover MS. ended paying $1,200 month. That’s near affordable. starting today, covered less, today’s new plan can’t medical history charge else. Sky-high premiums forced Nancy Beigel choose paying rent paying health insurance. She’s uninsured since. pays medical bills pocket, puts credit card, making harder pay.

Millions seniors discount prescription medicines. millions families actually received rebates insurance companies didn’t spend health care. law means choice, competition, lower costs millions Americans. law doesn’t mean economic security families. means we’re finally addressing biggest drivers long-term deficits. means stronger economy. Remember Republicans bunch predictions law haven’t come true. “death panels.” Costs haven’t skyrocketed; they’re growing slowest rate 50 years. years signed Affordable Care Act law slowest rates health spending growth record. contrary Republican claims, law hasn’t “destroyed” economy. past half years, businesses created 7.5 million new jobs. today, learned manufacturers growing fastest rate half years. factored Affordable Care Act. don't think it’s problem.

Now, let closing point: Republican shutdown threatens economy time millions Americans looking work, businesses starting traction. timing good. course, Republicans House ran office years ago promising shut government, so, apparently, they've wish. I've before, irony House Republicans contend they've shut bunch parts government, Affordable Care Act open business. you've Republican governors senators growing number reasonable Republican congressmen telling extreme right party knock off, pass budget, on. want underscore Congress doesn’t end shutdown reopen government -- Congress generally governing crisis. break habit. drag economy. worthy country. example, important Congress couple weeks raise what's called debt ceiling. it's important understand is. routine vote. Congress taken vote 45 times raise debt ceiling Ronald Reagan took office. cost taxpayers single dime. grow deficits single dime. authorize spend new money whatsoever. authorize Treasury pay bills Congress spent.

That’s about. routine. they’re supposed do. concession me. demand that’s unreasonable I’m making. Congress supposed routine matter. shouldn’t wait minute it. time Republicans threatened course action -- remember, 2011 -- economy staggered, credit rating downgraded time. time force United States default obligations time history, far dangerous government shutdown -- bad shutdown is. economic shutdown. I’ll speak coming days, let repeat: negotiate Congress’s responsibility pay bills it’s racked up.

President, looks intelligence morning, can’t help reminded America vigilant face threats. Fortunately, focusing specifics speculation hypotheticals, review process given -- hopefully American people -- clear direction change. today, announce series concrete substantial reforms administration intends adopt administratively seek codify Congress. First, approved new presidential directive signals intelligence activities home abroad. guidance strengthen executive branch oversight intelligence activities. ensure account security requirements, alliances; trade investment relationships, including concerns American companies; commitment privacy basic liberties. review decisions intelligence priorities sensitive targets annual basis actions regularly scrutinized senior national security team. Second, reform programs procedures place greater transparency surveillance activities, fortify safeguards protect privacy U.S. persons. began review, including released today, declassified 40 opinions orders Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, judicial review sensitive intelligence activities -- including Section 702 program targeting foreign individuals overseas, Section 215 telephone metadata program. going forward, I’m directing Director National Intelligence, consultation Attorney General, annually review purposes declassification future opinions court broad privacy implications, report Congress efforts. ensure court hears broader range privacy perspectives, calling Congress authorize establishment panel advocates government independent voice significant cases Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Third, additional protections activities conducted Section 702, allows government intercept communications foreign targets overseas that’s important national security. Specifically, asking Attorney General DNI institute reforms place additional restrictions government’s ability retain, search, criminal cases communications Americans foreign citizens incidentally collected Section 702. Fourth, investigating threats, FBI relies what's called national security letters, require companies specific limited government disclosing orders subject investigation. cases it's important subject investigation, possible terrorist spy, isn’t tipped off. transparent government uses authority. directed Attorney General amend national security letters secrecy indefinite, terminate fixed time government demonstrates real need secrecy. enable communications providers public orders received data government. brings program generated controversy past months -- bulk collection telephone records Section 215. Let repeat story broke: program involve content phone calls, names people making calls. Instead, record phone numbers times lengths calls -- metadata queried reasonable suspicion number linked terrorist organization. necessary? program grew desire address gap identified 9/11. 9/11 hijackers -- Khalid al-Mihdhar -- phone San Diego known Qaeda safe-house Yemen.

Rather, consolidates records database government query specific lead -- consolidation phone records companies retained business purposes. review group turned indication database intentionally abused. believe important capability program designed meet preserved. that, believe critics right point proper safeguards, type program yield private lives, open door intrusive bulk collection programs future.

Relying solely records multiple providers, example, require companies alter procedures ways raise new privacy concerns. hand, party maintaining single, consolidated database carrying essentially government function expense, legal ambiguity, potentially accountability -- doubtful impact increasing public confidence privacy protected. review process, suggested able preserve capabilities need combination existing authorities, sharing, recent technological advances. work needs determine exactly work. challenges involved, I’ve ordered transition away existing program proceed steps.

Next, step two, instructed intelligence community Attorney General transition period develop options new approach match capabilities gaps Section 215 program designed address government holding metadata itself. report options alternative approaches program comes reauthorization March 28th. period, consult relevant committees Congress seek views, seek congressional authorization new program needed.

I’ve clear United States collect intelligence suppress criticism dissent, collect intelligence disadvantage people basis ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs. collect intelligence competitive advantage U.S. companies U.S. commercial sectors. terms bulk collection signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies data meet specific security requirements: counterintelligence, counterterrorism, counter-proliferation, cybersecurity, force protection troops allies, combating transnational crime, including sanctions evasion. directive, taken unprecedented step extending protections American people people overseas. I’ve directed DNI, consultation Attorney General, develop safeguards, limit duration hold personal information, restricting information. line people world, regardless nationality, know United States spying ordinary people don’t threaten national security, privacy concerns account policies procedures. applies foreign leaders well. Given understandable attention issue received, clear intelligence community compelling national security purpose, monitor communications heads state government close friends allies. I’ve instructed national security team, intelligence community, work foreign counterparts deepen coordination cooperation ways rebuild trust going forward. let clear: intelligence agencies continue gather intentions governments -- opposed ordinary citizens -- world, way intelligence services nation does. apologize simply services effective. heads state government work closely, cooperation depend, feel confident treating real partners. changes I’ve ordered that. Finally, sure follow reforms, making important changes government organized. State Department designate senior officer coordinate diplomacy issues technology signals intelligence. appoint senior official White House implement new privacy safeguards announced today. devote resources centralize improve process handle foreign requests legal assistance, keeping high standards privacy helping foreign partners fight crime terrorism. asked counselor, John Podesta, lead comprehensive review big data privacy. group consist government officials who, President’s Council Advisors Science Technology, reach privacy experts, technologists business leaders, look challenges inherent big data confronted public private sectors; forge international norms manage data; continue promote free flow ways consistent privacy security. ultimately, what’s stake debate goes far months headlines, passing tensions foreign policy. cut noise, what’s stake remain true world remaking dizzying speed. it’s ability individuals communicate ideas; access filled great library country world; forge bonds people sides globe, technology remaking possible individuals, institutions, international order. reforms announced point new direction, mindful work needed future. I’m of: debate stronger. know time change, United States America lead. America held standard.

They’re wrong. here’s why. all, say trade agreement cost American jobs. they’re basing past experience, looking happened ‘90s, 20 years, outsourcing going on. know what, past trade agreements, it’s true, didn’t reflect values didn’t protect American workers. that’s we’re designing kind trade deal. truth companies care low wages, they’ve moved. don’t need new trade deals move. They’ve outsourced. They’ve located search low wages. trade agreement open doors higher-skill, higher-wage jobs future -- jobs excel at. sure manufacturers operating higher end value chain able access growing markets. is, past years, manufacturers steadily creating jobs time 1990s -- Administration. decade away spot, business leaders world declared United States world’s number place invest year row. year row. point is, outsourcing giving way insourcing. Companies starting advanced manufacturing, trend expect continue. trade deal help that. morning, Mark mentioned, Nike announced that, Trans-Pacific Partnership, new investments advanced manufacturing -- overseas, right United States. far Nike products U.S.A. means thousands new jobs manufacturing engineering design Nike facilities country, potentially tens thousands new jobs Nike’s supply chain home. That’s trade do. Look, I’ve spent half years trying rescue economy -- half years trying revitalize American manufacturing, including rescuing American auto industry fully recovered. risk thought trade deals going undermine it. reason I’m think enhance advance it. that’s point number one. Point number -- ask folks specifically, oppose trade deal, say “NAFTA.” NAFTA passed 20 years ago. agreement. fact, agreement fixes wrong NAFTA making labor environmental provisions actually enforceable. law school NAFTA passed. Number -- you’ve critics saying deal rushed through; it’s secret deal, people don’t know what’s it. true. agreement finalize 11 countries posted online 60 days sign it. Congress -- know they’re going fast. months review. crossed, dotted. going able exactly what’s it. There’s fast-track this. deliberate track -- fully subject scrutiny. I’m confident people read agreement themselves, they’ll progressive trade deal history. Number -- critics warn parts deal undermine American regulation -- food safety, worker safety, financial regulations. They’re making stuff up. true. trade agreement going force change laws. agreement sure companies aren’t discriminated countries. treat companies countries fairly here. companies don’t treated fairly there. need way settle disputes it’s subject whims government bureaucrat country. That’s important. want businesses succeed selling that's workers jobs United States. finally, critics talk currency manipulation. Now, problem past. countries, try lower currency makes goods cheaper, makes expensive. time China pretty egregious this. came office, started pounding them. time meet them, I’d talking currency. pushed hard, China moved. real terms, currency appreciated 30 percent came office. we're going going it. that’s argument trade agreement. chance help businesses sell stuff world’s fastest-growing markets, doesn't currency manipulation. is, folks opposed trade deals principle, reflexive principle. tell is, know what, you're opposed smart, progressive trade deals, means satisfied status quo. status quo hasn’t working workers. hasn’t working businesses. people tell why. I’m going couple examples small businesses chance meet today. Egg Press Portland-based greeting card company. nice. sell cards Australia, member Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. CEO, Tess Darrow -- where’s Tess? Raise hand. saw her. is. Tess says easily reach customers Japan, well, they’d sell half volume America. That’s lot. Right now, logistics exporting Japan complicated. Products end held months border. agreement help solve problems Tess sell greeting cards Japan -- presumably Japanese. going -- translation process, assume. Yes, absolutely. I’m teasing. trade deal help eliminate barriers, simplify customs, hold countries accountable products delivered swiftly. Tess sells, grow, hire Oregon, United States. Oregon Fruit Products -- makes canned fruits, berries, products -- depends exports 20 percent annual sales. Right now, exports members partnership we're putting together: Japan, Australia, Singapore, Canada. Unfortunately, selling countries right mean dealing unfair rules designed prevent products offered markets. agreement, change. Exporting simpler, consistent. means people world eating Oregon berries year long. Berry tasty. Sokol Blosser Winery -- drinkers here. It’s winery, family-run Dayton, Oregon. export markets Japan. Right now, high tariffs American wine country. trade partnership, tariffs eliminated, wineries America sales grow overseas. brother --and-sister team runs vineyard -- wave, guys -- say, “If easier business countries trading partners, countries allies, that’s thing.” They’re right. deal thing. let’s “just it.” took catch that, didn’t it? thought pretty obvious. So, listen, know folks skeptical trade. Past trade deals didn’t live hype. Labor environmental protections weren’t strong enough. saw years, Chicago towns Illinois, manufacturing collapsing, jobs drying up. Outsourcing real. Folks didn’t up. manufacturing base shifted 25 years, wasn’t manufacturing wasn’t communities, wasn’t workers. That’s truth. benefits -- jobs created, cheaper goods. real displacement real pain. so, Americans, abstraction; real. we’ve learn right lessons that. lesson pull drawbridge build moat ourselves. lesson is, we’ve sure trade deals shape ones allow compete fairly. took office, decided rethink way trade way actually works working Americans. didn’t think right companies. didn’t think right working families, fighting it. agreement undercuts working families, won’t sign it. ran office expand opportunity -- all-American idea matter are, come from, started out, love, America try. So, yes, mindful past, can’t ignore realities new economy. can’t stand beaches global economy shores. We’ve harness terms. century built us. It’s innovation.

Today, Iraq remains gripped sectarian conflict, emergence Qaeda Iraq evolved ISIL. ironically, single greatest beneficiary region war Islamic Republic Iran, saw strategic position strengthened theremoval long-standing enemy, Saddam Hussein. raise recent history need clear thinking foreign policy. raise history bears directly respond Iranian nuclear program. program decades, dating Shah’s efforts -- U.S. support -- 1960s ‘70s develop nuclear power. theocracy overthrew Shah accelerated program theIran-Iraq War 1980s, war Saddam Hussein chemical weapons brutal effect, Iran’s nuclear program advanced steadily 1990s, unilateral U.S. sanctions. Bush Administration took office, Iran centrifuges -- machines produce material bomb -- spinning enrich uranium. repeated warnings United States government, time took office, Iran installed thousand centrifuges, showed inclination slow -- halt -- program. U.S. policymakers, there’s disagreement danger posed Iranian nuclear bomb. Democrats Republicans alike recognized spark arms race world’s unstable region, turn crisis potential nuclear showdown. embolden terrorist groups, like Hezbollah, pose unacceptable risk Israel, Iranian leaders repeatedly threatened destroy. broadly, unravel global commitment non-proliferation world defend. question, then, prevent Iran obtaining nuclear weapon, how. taking office,I clear Iran allowed acquire nuclear weapon watch, it’s policy presidency options -- including possible military options -- table achieve objective. clear preference peaceful, diplomatic resolution issue -- costs war, negotiated agreement offered effective, verifiable durable resolution. so, 2009, let Iranians know diplomatic path available. Iran failed path, intelligence community exposed existence covert nuclear facility Fordow. Now, argued Iran’s intransigence showed futility negotiations. fact, willingness negotiate helped America rally world cause, secured international participation unprecedented framework commercial financial sanctions. mind unilateral U.S. sanctions Iran place decades, failed pressure Iran negotiating table. new approach effective ability draw new U.N. Security Council resolutions, combining strong enforcement voluntary agreements nations like China India, Japan South Korea reduce purchases Iranian oil, imposition European allies total oil embargo. Winning global buy-in easy -- know. there. cases, partners lost billions dollars trade decision cooperate. able convince absent diplomatic resolution, result war, major disruptions global economy, greater instability Middle East. words, diplomacy -- hard, painstaking diplomacy -- saber-rattling, tough talk ratcheted pressure Iran. world unified us, Iran’s economy contracted severely, remains 20 percent smaller today been. doubt hardship played role inIran’s 2013 elections, Iranian people elected new government promised improve economy engagement world. window cracked open. Iran came nuclear talks. series negotiations, Iran agreed international community interim deal -- deal rolled Iran’s stockpile near 20 percent enriched uranium, froze progress program P5 1 -- United States, China, Russia, United Kingdom, Germany, France, European Union -- negotiate comprehensive deal fear Iran stalling time. Now, let pause remind thatwhen interim deal announced, critics -- critics we’re hearing -- called “a historic mistake.” insisted Iran ignore obligations. warned sanctions unravel. warned Iran receive windfall support terrorism. critics wrong. progress Iran’s nuclear program halted time decade. stockpile dangerous materials reduced. deployment advanced centrifuges stopped. Inspections increase. flood money Iran, architecture international sanctions remained place. fact, interim deal worked people criticized fiercely cite excuse support broader accord. Think that. proclaimed historic mistake held success reason sign comprehensive deal. mind assess credibility arguments diplomacy today. criticism, moved ahead negotiate lasting, comprehensive deal. diplomats, led Secretary State John Kerry, kept coalition united. nuclear experts --including best world, Secretary Energy Ernie Moniz -- worked tirelessly technical details. July, reached comprehensive plan action meets objectives. terms, Iran allowed build nuclear weapon. Iran, like party Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, allowed access peaceful nuclear energy, agreement strictly defines manner nuclear program proceed, ensuring pathways bomb cut off. Here’s how: deal, Iran acquire plutonium needed bomb. Thecore heavy-water reactor Arak pulled out, filled concrete, replaced produce plutonium weapon. spent fuel reactor shipped country, Iran build new heavy-water reactors 15 years. Iran able acquire enriched uranium bomb. soon deal implemented, Iran remove two-thirds centrifuges. decade, Iran enrich uranium advanced centrifuges. Iran enrich uranium previously undisclosedFordow facility, buried deep underground, 15 years. Iran rid 98 percent stockpile enriched uranium, currently 10 nuclear bombs, 15 years. 15 years passed, Iran right peaceful program cover pursue weapon. And, fact, deal shuts type covert path Iran pursued past. 24/7 monitoring Iran’s key nuclear facilities. decades, inspectors access Iran’s entire nuclear supply chain -- uranium mines mills raw materials, centrifuge production facilities machines enrich it. understand important: Iran cheat, build building covert facility like Fordow. need secret source single aspect program. nation history able pull subterfuge subjected rigorous inspections. terms deal, inspectors permanent ability inspect suspicious sites Iran. finally, Iran powerful incentives commitments. sanctions relief, Iran significant, concrete steps like removing centrifuges rid stockpile. Iran violates agreement decade, sanctions snap place. won’t need support members U.N. Security Council; America trigger snapback own. hand, Iran abides deal economy begins reintegrate world, incentive avoid snapback grow. deal best choice alternatives -– strongest non-proliferation agreement negotiated. strong deal, nation world commented publicly, exception Israeli government1, expressed support. TheUnited Nations Security Council unanimously supported it. majority arms control non-proliferation experts support it. 100 ambassadors -- served Republican Democratic Presidents -- support it. I’ve tough calls President, deal American security calls. It’s close. Unfortunately, we’re living time American politics foreign policy decision viewed partisan prism, evaluated headline-grabbing sound bites. ink dry deal -- Congress read -- majority Republicans declared virulent opposition. Lobbyists pundits suddenly transformed arm-chair nuclear scientists, disputing assessments experts like Secretary Moniz, challenging findings, offering multiple -- contradictory -- arguments Congress reject deal. repeat arguments long enough, traction. let address arguments far opposition deal. First, say inspections strong inspectors can’t Iran time notice. Well, here’s truth: Inspectors allowed daily access Iran’s key nuclear sites. reason inspecting suspicious, undeclared site Iran, inspectors access, Iran objects. access little 24 hours’ notice. process resolving dispute access 24 days, we’ve identified site raises suspicion, watching continuously inspectors in. way, nuclear material isn’t hide closet. leave trace years. line is, Iran cheats, catch -- will. Second, argue deal isn’t strong limitations Iran’s civilian nuclear program expire 15 years. Let repeat: prohibition Iran nuclear weapon permanent. ban weapons-related research permanent. Inspections permanent. true limitations Iran’s peaceful program 15 years. that’s arms control agreements work. SALT Treaty Soviet Union lasted years. START Treaty lasted 15 years. current situation, 15 20 years now, Iran tries build bomb, deal ensures United States tools detect it, stronger basis international law respond, options weapons program today, including -- -- military options. hand, deal, scenarios critics warn happening 15 years happen months now. killing deal, Congress merely pave Iran’s pathway bomb, accelerate it. Third, number critics say deal isn’t worth Iran billions dollars sanctions relief. Now, let’s clear: international sanctions place precisely Iran agree constraints program. That's point sanctions. negotiated agreement Iran involve sanctions relief. argument sanctions relief effectively argument diplomatic resolution issue. true Iran lives commitments, gain access roughly 56 billion dollars money -- revenue frozen overseas countries. notion game-changer, money funneled Iran’s pernicious activities, misses reality Iran’s current situation. Partly sanctions, Iranian government half trillion dollars urgent requirements -- funding pensions salaries, paying crumbling infrastructure. Iran’s leaders raised expectations people sanctions relief improve lives. repressive regime like Iran’s completely ignore expectations. that’s best analysts expect bulk revenue spending improves economy benefits lives Iranian people. Now, say sanctions relief benefit Iran’s military. Let’s stipulate money flow activities object to. illusions Iranian government, significance Revolutionary Guard Quds Force. Iran supports terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. supports proxy groups threaten interests interests allies -- including proxy groups killed troops Iraq. try destabilize Gulf partners. Iran engaged activities decades. engaged sanctions sanctions place. fact, Iran engaged activities middle Iran-Iraq War -- war cost nearly million lives hundreds billions dollars. truth Iran way fund efforts, benefit Iran claim sanctions relief pales comparison danger pose nuclear weapon. Moreover, there’s scenario sanctions relief turns Iran region’s dominant power. Iran’s defense budget times smaller combined budget Gulf allies. conventional capabilities compare Israel’s, commitment Israel’s qualitative military edge helps guarantee that. years, Iran spend billions dollars support ally Arab World -- Bashar al-Assad -- he’s lost control huge chunks country. Hezbollah suffered significant blows battlefield. Iran, like rest region, forced respond threat ISIL Iraq. contrary alarmists claim Iran brink taking Middle East, world, Iran remain regional power set challenges. ruling regime dangerous repressive. continue sanctions place Iran’s support terrorism violation human rights. continue insist release Americans detained unjustly. differences Iranian regime. we’re confronting Iran’s destabilizing activities, hard imagine worse approach blocking deal. Instead, need check behavior we're concerned directly: helping allies region strengthen capabilities counter cyber-attack ballistic missile; improving interdiction weapons shipments groups like Hezbollah; training allies’ special forces effectively respond situations like Yemen. capabilities difference. stronger position implement deal. And, way, strategy helps effectively confront lethal threat posed ISIL. Now, final criticism -- sort catch-all hear -- notion there’s deal had. “We deal” -- that’s repeated again. “It's bad deal, need deal” -- relies vague promises toughness, and, recently, argument apply broader indefinite set sanctions squeeze Iranian regime harder. making argument ignorant Iranian society, they’re straight American people. Sanctions going force Iran completely dismantle vestiges nuclear infrastructure -- aspects consistent peaceful programs. oftentimes critics calling “a deal.” Iranian government, Iranian opposition, Iranian people agree view total surrender sovereignty. Moreover, closest allies Europe, Asia -- China Russia -- certainly going agree enforce existing sanctions 5, 10, 15 years according dictates U.S. Congress. willingness support sanctions place based Iran ending pursuit nuclear weapons. based belief Iran peaceful nuclear power. certainly wasn’t based desire regime change Iran. result, say walk away deal maintain sanctions selling fantasy. strengthening position suggested, Congress’s rejection certainly result multilateral sanctions unraveling. If, suggested, tried maintain unilateral sanctions, beefen up, standing alone. dictate foreign, economic energy policies major power world. order try that, sanction, example, world’s largest banks. We’d cut countries like China American financial system. happen major purchasers debt, actions trigger severe disruptions economy and, way, raise questions internationally dollar’s role world’s reserve currency. That’s reason previous unilateral sanctions waived. What’s likely happen, Congress reject deal, Iran end form sanctions relief accept constraints inspections required deal. sense, critics right: Walk away agreement deal -- Iran. Now, sanctions won’t produce results critics want, honest. Congressional rejection deal leaves U.S. Administration absolutely committed preventing Iran nuclear weapon option -- war Middle East. say provocative. stating fact. deal, Iran position -- tough rhetoric –- steadily advance capabilities. breakout time, fairly small, shrink near zero. doubt voices raised deal demanding bomb nuclear facilities? firmly believes Iran nuclear weapon, wrestled issue beginning presidency, tell alternatives military action exhausted reject hard-won diplomatic solution world unanimously supports. let’s mince words. choice face ultimately diplomacy form war -- maybe tomorrow, maybe months now, soon. here’s irony. before, military action far effective deal preventing Iran obtaining nuclear weapon. That’s supposition. estimate, including Israeli analysts, suggest military action set Iran’s program years best, fraction limitations imposed deal. likely guarantee inspectors kicked Iran. probable drive Iran’s program deeper underground. certainly destroy international unity we’ve spent years building. Now, opponents -- credit; opponents deal accept choice war. fact, argue surgical strikes Iran’s facilities quick painless. we’ve learned decade, it’s wars general wars Middle East simple. certainty war human suffering, uncertain costs, unintended consequences. sure Americans bear heaviest burden 1 percent us, outstanding men women serve uniform, war. Commander-in-Chief, shied using force necessary. ordered tens thousands young Americans combat. sat bedside come home. I’ve ordered military action countries. times force necessary, Iran abide deal, it’s possible don’t alternative. conscience justify war we’ve tested diplomatic agreement achieves objectives; agreed Iran; supported rest world; preserves options deal falls short? justify troops? justify world future generations? end, lesson we’ve learned decade war. end, ask tough questions. Subject assumptions evidence analysis. Resist conventional wisdom drumbeat war. Worry labeled weak; worry right. recognize resorting force tempting face rhetoric behavior emanates parts Iran. offensive. incendiary. seriously. superpowers act impulsively response taunts, provocations addressed short war. Iranian hardliners chant “Death America” mean that’s Iranians believe. fact, it’s hardliners comfortable status quo. It’s hardliners chanting “Death America” opposed deal. They’re making common cause Republican caucus. majority Iranian people powerful incentives urge government different, provocative direction -- incentives strengthened deal. offer chance. opportunity. It’s guaranteed succeed. it, Iran, United States. region known conflict. world. Iran direction, Iran violates deal, ample ability respond. agreements pursued Kennedy Reagan Soviet Union, agreements, treaties involved America accepting significant constraints arsenal. such, riskier. agreement involves constraints. defense budget United States 600 billion dollars. repeat, Iran’s 15 billion dollars. military remains ultimate backstop security agreement make. stated Iran allowed obtain nuclear weapon. sure military options real. doubt follows position. let sum here. carefully examine arguments deal, stand scrutiny. rhetoric strident. suppose ascribed knee-jerk partisanship familiar; rhetoric renders decision that’s disaster, surrender -- “you're aiding terrorists; you're endangering freedom.” hand, think it’s important acknowledge another, understandable motivation opposition deal, skepticism deal, affinity friend ally, Israel -- affinity that, stalwart friend Israel career, deeply share. Israeli government opposed something, people United States notice. should. blame Israelis deep skepticism dealings government like Iran’s -- includes leaders denied Holocaust, embrace ideology anti-Semitism, facilitate flow rockets arrayed Israel’s borders, pointed Tel Aviv. dangerous neighborhood, Israel vigilant, rightly insists depend country -- great friend United States -- security. seriously concerns Israel. is, partly American military intelligence assistance, Administration unprecedented levels, Israel defend conventional danger -- Iran directly proxies. hand, nuclear-armed Iran changes equation. that’s deal ultimately judged achieves central goal preventing Iran obtaining nuclear weapon. deal exactly that. say strengthen Israel’s security. clear Israeli government prepared discuss deepen cooperation further. we’ve held talks Israel concluding 10-year plan U.S. security assistance Israel. enhance support areas like missile defense, sharing, interdiction -- help meet Israel’s pressing security needs, hedge additional activities Iran engage consequence sanctions relief. listened Israeli security establishment, warned danger posed nuclear-armed Iran decades. fact, helped develop ideas ultimately led deal. friends Israel, Israeli people, say this: nuclear-armed Iran far dangerous Israel, America, world Iran benefits sanctions relief. recognize Prime Minister Netanyahu disagrees -- disagrees strongly. doubt sincerity. believe wrong. believe support deal. believe America’s Israel’s interest. United States, abrogation constitutional duty act best judgment simply causes temporary friction dear friend ally. believe right United States. believe right Israel. couple weeks, repeatedly challenged opposed deal forward better, plausible alternative. hear one. I’ve heard types arguments heard run-up Iraq War: Iran dealt diplomatically; military strikes significant consequences; shouldn’t worry rest world thinks, act, fall line; tougher talk, military threats force Iran submission; deal. know it’s easy play people’s fears, magnify threats, compare attempt diplomacy Munich. arguments hold up. didn’t 2002 2003; shouldn’t now. mindset, cases offered people compunction repeatedly wrong, led war strengthen Iran, isolate United States decades since. It’s mindset step traditions American foreign policy, exhaust diplomacy war, debate matters war peace cold light truth. “Peace absence conflict,” Reagan said. “the ability cope conflict peaceful means.” 2 Kennedy warned Americans, “not conflict inevitable, accommodation impossible, communication exchange threats.” 3 time apply wisdom. deal doesn’t bet Iran changing, doesn’t require trust; verifies requires Iran forsake nuclear weapon, struck agreements Soviet Union time threatening allies, arming proxies us, proclaiming commitment destroy way life, nuclear weapons pointed major cities -- genuine existential threat. live complicated world -- world forces unleashed human innovation creating opportunities children unimaginable human history. world persistent threats, world mass violence cruelty common, human innovation risks destruction hold dear. world, United States America remains powerful nation Earth, believe remain decades come. nation many. separates empires old, exceptional, mere military might. World War II, deadliest war human history, power try bind nations international law. led evolution human institutions Kennedy spoke -- prevent spread deadly weapons, uphold peace security, promote human progress. opportunity build progress. built coalition held sanctions negotiations, solution prevents Iran obtaining nuclear weapon, resorting war. Americans, proud achievement. members Congress reflect pending decision, urge set political concerns, shut noise, consider stakes involved vote cast. Congress kills deal, lose constraints Iran’s nuclear program, sanctions painstakingly built. lost precious: America’s credibility leader diplomacy; America’s credibility anchor international system. John F. Kennedy cautioned here, 50 years ago, university, “the pursuit peace dramatic pursuit war.” 4 it’s important. surely pursuit peace needed world strife. fellow Americans, contact representatives Congress.

I’ve point issue, right? importation politics nationally, cable talk radio, seeps everything. point I’m trying care fixing politics I’m today, initiatives blocked Congress -- happens President, happens governor, happens participates -- participates democracy. You're going 100 percent want time. reason important is, year I’ll hold important title all, that's title citizen. American citizen, understand progress inevitable -- progress inevitable. fought for, won us, kind patriotism fellow Illinoisan, Adlai Stevenson, ""short, frenzied outburst emotion, tranquil steady dedication lifetime."" requires citizenship sense one. today kind citizenship threatened poisonous political climate pushes people away participating public life. turns folks off. discourages them, makes cynical. happens, powerful extreme voices void. happens, progress stalls. that’s end handful lobbyists setting agenda. That’s end policies detached working families face day. That’s end well-connected publicly demand government stay business whisper ear special treatment. That’s political consumed small people called great -- shot changing economy; America safe strong uncertain world; repair climate threatens leave kids. that’s what’s mind come Illinois today. focus course year beyond: do, us, together, try politics better? speak sides this. know, better, feel prouder work better. So, first, let’s rest couple myths politics. myth problems politics new. not. American politics gentle high-minded -- especially times great change. mentioned visited mosque Maryland week, Thomas Jefferson’s opponent tried stir suggesting Muslim. I’m company. that’s compared newspaper warned Jefferson elected, ""murder, robbery, rape, adultery, incest openly taught practiced."" Vice President, Aaron Burr, literally killed Alexander Hamilton duel. don’t want tell Andrew Jackson’s opponents mamma. Lincoln, himself, routinely called ""weak, wishy-washy,"" ""yahoo,"" ""an unshapely man,"" ""the obscene ape Illinois,"" and, favorite -- ""facetious pettifogger."" don’t know means -- sounds insulting. So, comparatively speaking, today bad -- long you’ve skin. Harold Washington said: ""Politics ain't beanbag."" It’s tough. that’s okay. There’s notion politics broken politicians significantly corrupt beholden big money be. There’s doubt lobbyists easier access halls power average American. There’s work need sure works ordinary people well-connected. That’s true federal level; that’s true state level. Folks aren’t entirely wrong feel rigged address interests. But, relative past, listen, I’m confident we’ve rules checks prevent Cabinet siphoning whiskey tax revenue pockets like Grant’s administration did. FDR went ward bosses Tammany Hall, controlled judges politicians -- patronage, bribery, money laundering. It’s easy whip tens thousands phantom votes, Chicago South Texas. Teapot Dome Watergate, history tells vigilant demand public servants follow highest ethical standards. truth kind corruption blatant, sort saw past, likely today’s politics. Justice Department media work hard way. that’s thing. don’t want romanticize past think it’s difference people elected. isn’t true today’s issues inherently polarizing past. remember, endured years Civil War resulted hundreds thousands dead Americans. country divided fundamental question. Pearl Harbor, entering World War II highly charged debate. fault lines Vietnam, culture wars ‘60s -- echo politics half-century later. We’ve arguing founding proper size role government; meaning individual freedom equality; war peace, best way citizens opportunity. important debates join, rigor free people require. point is, problem politicians worse, problem issues tougher. it’s important understand situation today unique hopeless. We’ve periods democracy stuck. happens, new way business. We’re moments. We’ve build politics -- that’s spectacle battle ideas; that’s business mission; understands success American experiment rests willingness engage citizens work. starts acknowledging problem. know it. What’s today nature extent polarization. ideologically divided parties brought long-term trends politics culture. parties homogenous ever. great sorting taken place drove Southern conservatives Democratic Party, Northern moderates Republican Party, don’t party diversity views. you’ve fractured media. folks watch FOX News; folks read Huffington Post. often, what’s profitable sensational conflict incendiary sound bites. choose facts. don’t common basis what’s true what’s not. mean, listened conservative pundits, wouldn’t vote either. sound like scary guy. You’ve advocacy groups that, frankly, benefit keeping members agitated possible, assured righteousness cause. Unlimited dark money -- money knows it’s coming from, who’s paying -- drowns ordinary voices. far surrender voices entirely choosing vote. polarization pervasive seeps society point surveys suggest Americans wouldn’t want kids date political party. Now, don’t want kids dating, period. that’s losing battle. isn’t abstract problem political scientists. real impact together. real impact families able support themselves, homeless shelter cold day. makes difference quality education kids getting. abstraction. often, debates, Washington increasingly state legislatures, abstractions. It’s people involved, it’s cardboard cutouts caricatures positions. encourages kind ideological fealty rejects compromise form weakness. big, complicated democracy like ours, can’t compromise, definition, can’t govern ourselves. Look, progressive Democrat. proud that. bones it. I’m going point here. believe people access health care. believe access public education. believe workers deserve higher minimum wage. believe collective bargaining critical prospects middle class, pensions vital retirement, long they’re funded responsibly. Hold second. Hold second. Sit down, Democrats. Sit down. Sit -- second. appreciate that, want larger point. believe we’re judged care poor vulnerable. believe order live ideals, continually fight discrimination forms. believe science, science like climate change, transition cleaner sources energy help preserve planet future generations. believe tough, smart foreign policy says America hesitate protect people allies, element power rush war. believe. here’s point want make. believe Republicans share values, disagree means achieve them. think Republican colleagues constructive points outdated regulations need changed, programs well-intended, didn't work way supposed to. I’ve opportunity common ground, doesn’t sellout party. applies -- well, we’ll talk later, Duncan. happens, starts cherry-picking. I’ve learned folks don't change. trying common ground doesn't Democrat progressive. means I’m trying stuff done. applies Republican who, heaven forbid, agree issue -- America great, decided stand State Union. It’s controversial proposition. You're going trouble. that's hard testament difficult politics become. folks worried, well, I’m going yelled you, blogger going write that, talk host going talk me, suddenly I’ve challenger, calling RINO real progressive. hear voices party boast refusal compromise accomplishment itself, I’m impressed. prevent Americans consider actual accomplishments -- like fixing roads, educating kids, passing budgets, cleaning environment, making streets safe. cuts ways, guys. See, suddenly standing. fascinating watch. point is, cuts ways. Founders trusted keys self-government. politics place try incredible machinery work; come settle differences solve big problems, big possibly alone. Founders anchored visionary Constitution separates power demands compromise, precisely prevent party, wing party, faction, powerful interests 100 percent way. makes blanket promises base can’t possibly meet -- tax cuts cuts services -- ""everything fine, won’t spend money"" -- war shared sacrifice -- ""we’re going tough, don’t worry, fine"" -- union bashing corporate bashing acknowledging workers businesses economy run -- kind politics means supporters perennially disappointed. adds folks’ sense rigged. It’s reasons big electoral swings years. It’s people cynical. Now, don’t pretend answers this. trends change overnight. did, executive action. joke, guys. Relax. sense humor helpful. want offer steps believe help reform institutions way helps reflect selves. aren’t original, want ahead mention them. take, reduce, corrosive influence money politics. Now, year, 150 families -- 150 families -- spent presidential race rest America combined. Today, couple billionaires state push agenda, dump dark money state -- knows it’s coming -- dark ads, kind dark worst picture possible. there’s ominous voice talking they’re destroying country. spend money based ideological preference disconnected realities people live. They’re concerned what’s happening union hall Galesburg, folks going trying job. They’re familiar what’s happening VFW post. Somebody’s phone on. Carbondale. haven’t heard personally farmers Quads they’re going through. voices outweighing handful folks money. I’m saying folks money voice; I’m saying shouldn’t able drown else’s. that’s disagree Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. don’t believe money speech, political spending limits, shouldn’t disclosed. support constitutional amendment set reasonable limits financial influence America’s elections. amending Constitution extremely challenging time-consuming process -- be. we’re going come ways reduce influence money politics. proposals there, work ones gain bipartisan support -- handful families hidden interests shouldn’t able bankroll elections greatest democracy Earth. second step politics rethinking way draw congressional districts. Now, let point -- want point out, case cherry-picking here. tends popular states Democrats drawing lines Republicans, popular Republicans control drawing lines. let’s clear -- clean hands thing. clean hands thing. is, today technology allows parties power precision-draw constituencies opposition’s supporters packed districts possible. That’s districts shaped like earmuffs spaghetti. It’s party seats votes. gerrymandering insulate incumbents challenge party, means incumbents worried challengers extreme voices party. That’s what’s happened Congress. wonder Congress doesn’t work? House Representatives there, handful -- 10 percent -- districts competitive point. you’re Republican, you’re worried right saying you, know you’re going lose general election. true Democrats. debates away middle, Americans are, far ends spectrum. polarizes further. Now, power fix. census rolls up-to-date picture America’s population, change way districts drawn. America, politicians pick voters; voters pick politicians. needs nation, select states. everywhere. Now, Americans voice participate, captive politics narrow constituencies. matter undisclosed money spent, matter negative ads run, matter unrepresentative district drawn, voted, far larger number people voted, overcome ways institutional barriers. politics better. that’s step politics making voting easier, harder; modernizing way live now. Now, shouldn’t controversial, guys. liked redistricting thing, letting people vote. applause that, too. Listen, years ago, set bipartisan commission improve voting experience America. election lawyers campaign Mitt Romney’s campaign. context politics. actually want assembly moving adopt recommendations. work dear friend, Senator Don Harmon, you, there’s new law going effect year allow Illinoisans register vote polls Election Day. expands early voting -- makes easier working folks busy parents vote. Think it. you’re single mom, you’ve public transportation punch clock, work round clock, home, cook dinner Tuesday bad weather -- that’s tough. want couldn’t Saturday Sunday? advancing democracy? law difference. I’m proud home state helping lead way. know works. 2012 2014, states highest voter turnout same-day registration. today, ask state America join -- reduce barriers voting. easier constituents vote. I’d encourage assembly step. Senator Manar Representative Gabel bills automatically register eligible citizen vote apply driver’s license. protect fundamental right everybody. Democrats, Republicans, independents, seniors, folks disabilities, men women military -- sure easier vote vote counted. constituents, think pass legislation right away. think Governor sign delay. Let’s Land Lincoln leader voter participation. That's proud do. Let’s set pace -- encourage states country follow lead, making automatic voter registration new norm America. Now, course talk, it’s interesting watch dynamics, obviously. politics designed short-term, tactical gain. think voters hurt Election Day, suddenly you're interested participation. think gerrymandering helping hurting you, you're proposals. trapped things. know better. setting set rules ahead time, didn't know stood, party going in, didn't data poll numbers tell what’s going edge not, you’d set fair. You’d encourage it. That's learned civics books. That's work. can't that, brings point, is, change way works, responsibility change way we, elected officials citizens, work together. democracy works right -- fair, build culture trying work. Recently, I’ve thinking friend mine, Deval Patrick, constituents governor Massachusetts. said, ""Insist modicum civility condition serving you."" told voters. ""Insist modicum civility."" think that’s us, Americans, insist other. children watching do. don’t learn school, learn watching -- way conduct ourselves, way treat other. lie other, learn it’s lie. ignore science, think it’s opinion matters. insulting like school kids, think, well, guess that's people supposed behave. way respect -- don’t -- citizens determine hard, frustrating, absolutely work self-government continues. I’ve daughters older now, important parent think seeing you're public, you're dealing important, -- treat people generally. makes mindful. want live expectations. way, want democracy live people’s expectations. can't forward tear down. political incentives, today, rewards kind behavior. That's attention. require courage act way parents taught act. shouldn’t, political environment apparently does. We’ve insist other, other. reward who’d disenfranchise segment America, we’ve insist arm information, facts, vote. 99 percent voted, wouldn’t matter 1 percent spends elections. reward extreme voices, divisive language, best launching schoolyard taunts, insist higher form discourse common life, based empathy respect, -- mean abandon principle. doesn't mean you're tough. paint disagree motivated malice, suggest lack patriotism -- insist, Lincoln did, enemies, friends; fellow Americans entitled point view, love country do. reward 24/7 media thrives sensationalism conflict, stand insist, no, reason matters, matter; issues complicated. folks stuff up, can’t unchallenged. that’s true Democrats hear Democratic up, that’s true Republican Republican cross line. accept notion compromise sellout side, we’ve insist opposite -- genuine victory means progress sides. preventing kids dating people parties -- well, issues dating, generally -- trust we’ve raised kids right thing, look qualities people’s character, label attached them. maybe, all, begins grow cynical politics, believes actions can’t difference it’s worth participating in, we’ve insist, evidence contrary, difference. job citizen United States America, that’s big deal. It's revere seriously. Abraham Lincoln wasn’t giant think today. lacked formal schooling. businesses law practices struggled. term Congress, opposition Mexican-American War damaged reputation badly run reelection. denounced traitor, demagogue, enemy sympathizer. returned law practice admitted losing politics entirely. happened shook conscience. Congress effectively overturned Missouri Compromise, flawed fragile law prohibited slavery North legalized South, left ultimately unsettled. stunned news, Lincoln he’d roused ""as before"" meant America’s future. so, Springfield, state fair, game delivered great anti-slavery speeches crowd thousands. years, lost political races, arguments Douglas shaped national debate.

Number three: life passion change; need strategy. I'll repeat that. want passion, strategy. awareness, action. hashtags, votes. see, change requires righteous anger. requires program, requires organizing. 1964 Democratic Convention, Fannie Lou Hamer -- five-feet-four-inches tall -- gave fiery speech national stage. went home Mississippi organized cotton pickers. didn't tools technology whip movement minutes. door door.

It's duty. it’s time elect member Congress city councilman, school board member, sheriff. That’s change politics -- electing people level representative accountable us. complicated. Don’t complicated. finally, change requires speaking -- requires listening, well. particular, requires listening disagree, prepared compromise. state senator, helped pass Illinois’s racial profiling law, laws nation requiring videotaping confessions capital cases. successful because, early on, engaged law enforcement. didn’t say them, oh, guys racist, need something. understood, do, overwhelming majority police officers good, honest, courageous, fair, love communities serve. knew bad apples, cops best intentions -- including, way, African American police officers -- unconscious biases, do. engaged listened, kept working built consensus. took time listen, crafted legislation police -- improved trust cooperation community -- communities, likely treated unfairly. say unequivocally: acceptance police organizations Illinois, bills passed. simple. blocked them. point is, need allies democracy.

That's cheat progress. remember Dr. King’s soaring oratory, power letter Birmingham jail, marches led. sat Johnson Oval Office try Civil Rights Act Voting Rights Act passed. seminal bills perfect -- like Emancipation Proclamation war document clarion freedom. mileposts progress perfect. centuries slavery Jim Crow eliminate racism 40 acres mule. better. know what, time. tell staff -- good, consolidate gains fight stronger position.

That’s change things. Change isn’t happens years years; change placing faith politician putting feet saying, okay, go. Change effort committed citizens hitch wagons bigger fight single day.

Fascism threatened overrun entire world -- wage total war response. Communism threatened overturn world order, threatened nuclear holocaust -- build armaments alliances contain it. Today’s terrorists kill innocent people, don't pose existential threat nation, mistake elevating do. job them. makes important helps recruitment. second point follow path previous great powers defeated over-reach. protecting homeland drawing number troops serving harm’s way overseas, helped save resources, importantly, lives. tell you, course years, shied away sending men women danger necessary. It's hardest decision make, it's I've security American people stake. I've seen costs. I've held hands wounded warriors Walter Reed. I've met caskets fallen Dover. that's apologies sending troops harm’s way clear mission achievable absolutely necessary. Number three, need wisdom upholding values adhering rule law weakness; long term, greatest strength. objective terrorists scare changing nature democracy. is, people nations decisions driven fear. terrorists directly destroy way life, lose track values nation founded upon. remind Commander-in-Chief, protect people, swore oath defend Constitution. years, demonstrated staying true traditions nation laws advances security values. prohibited torture, everywhere, times -- includes tactics like waterboarding. time worked told cost intelligence. capture terrorists, political rhetoric need strip terrorists rights, interrogation teams obtained valuable terrorists resorting torture, operating law. Article III courts delivered justice faster military trials. prisons proven capable holding dangerous terrorists. Consider terrorists captured, lawfully interrogated, prosecuted civilian courts. Faisal Shahzad, tried set car bomb Times Square. Dzohkar Tsarneyev, Boston Marathon bomber. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, so-called “underwear bomber.” American juries judges determined people know freedom again. lawfully. wheels justice right turning -- terrorists like Ahmed Warsame, al-Shabaab commander, Abu Khatalla, accused leader Benghazi attacks. terrorists stay true are. And, fact, success dealing terrorists justice reinforces past time shut detention facility Guantanamo. opinion, it's opinion military leaders. administration, responsibly transferred 175 detainees foreign governments, safeguards reduce risk returning battlefield. we've cut population Gitmo 242 59. politics fear led Congress prevent detainees transferred prisons United States -- though, speak, imprison dangerous terrorists prisons, dangerous criminals prisons country; allies oftentimes turn terrorist think terrorist end Gitmo; groups like ISIL Gitmo propaganda. we're wasting hundreds millions dollars 60 people detention facility Cuba. That’s strength. Congress changes course, judged harshly history, continue remove blot national honor. Number four, fight terrorists way create terrorists. example, dangerous world, terrorists seek places it’s impossible capture them, count local governments so. means best option terrorists targeted strike. taken action command, including drones, remove terrorists battlefield, protects troops prevented real threats American people. Now, rules place public, strike taken warzone, near certainty civilians killed injured. strike, acknowledged tragic instances innocents killed strikes, highest standard set. Nevertheless, critics suggest strikes wrong. say them, weigh alternatives. Drone strikes allow deny terrorists safe haven airstrikes, precise, invasions likely kill innocent civilians American servicemembers. actions we’ve taken lives home abroad. point is, careful sure actions, we’re alienating local populations, serve recruitment new terrorists. Number five, transparency accountability serve national security times peace, but, importantly, times conflict. that’s we’ve public terrorist organizations we’re fighting we’re fighting them. We’ve released assessments non-combatants killed operations, taken responsibility mistakes made. We've declassified interrogation methods wrong learn past mistakes. yesterday, directed government time release description legal policy frameworks guide military operations world. public allows informed public debate, potential check unfettered executive power. power presidency awesome, supposed bound you, citizens. here’s thing: doesn’t mean anything, doesn’t work people’s representatives Congress don’t jobs, they’re paying attention. Right now, waging war authorities Congress 15 years ago -- 15 years ago. gray hair 15 years ago. years ago, asked Congress, let’s update authorization, new authorization war ISIL, reflecting changing nature threats, reflecting lessons we’ve learned decade. far, Congress refused vote. Democracies operate state permanently authorized war. That’s military, it’s democracy. And, way, reason that’s dangerous today, outstanding, all-volunteer force, percent population actually fighting. means carrying burden. means important know we’re explain public, easy percent population they’re thought through. threat require sacrifice men women uniform, members Congress courage clear stand -– sidelines -- cable TV shows, fulfilling constitutional duty authorizing force threats face today. That’s democracies supposed work. Number six, outstanding military work, draw strength diplomacy. Terrorists love walk away type work builds international coalitions, ends conflicts, stops spread deadly weapons. life easier them; tragic mistake us. think we’ve years firing shot. We’ve rolled Iran’s nuclear program. That’s assessment, that’s assessment Israeli intelligence, opposed deal. We’ve secured nuclear materials globe, reducing risk fall hands terrorists. We’ve eliminated Syria’s declared chemical weapons program. steps helped safe helped troops safe. result diplomacy. sustained diplomatic efforts, matter frustrating difficult appear, going required resolve conflicts roiling Middle East, Yemen, Syria, Israel Palestine. don’t strong efforts there, called clean failure diplomacy. Similarly, long-term strategy reduce threat terrorism depends investments strengthen fragile societies. generals, commanders understand this. charity. It’s fundamental national security. dollar spent development worth dollar spent fighting war. prevent conflicts starting place. ensure peace lasting -- we've fought. It’s people falling prey extremism -- children going school think themselves, families feed aren’t desperate, communities ravaged diseases, countries devastated climate changes. Americans, value empowering civil societies outlets people’s frustrations, support entrepreneurs want build businesses destroying. invest young people areas generating terrorists typically huge youth bulge, makes dangerous. times need help refugees escaped horrors war search life. military recognizes issues governance human dignity development vital security. It’s central plans places like Afghanistan Iraq. Let’s sure wisdom reflected budgets, well. finally, fight, uphold civil liberties define us. Terrorists want turn another. defeating requires draw enormous capabilities government, sure changes address terrorists abused. why, example, we’ve extensive reforms gather intelligence world, increasing oversight, placing new restrictions government’s ability retain search communications people trust us, way cooperate work us. don’t power indiscriminately read emails listen phone calls targeted folks trying harm. save lives. so, maintaining civil liberties, sustain confidence American people cooperation allies readily. Protecting liberty -- that's Americans, some. fighting terrorists claim fight behalf Islam. speak billion Muslims world, speak American Muslims, including wear uniform United States America’s military. stigmatize good, patriotic Muslims, feeds terrorists’ narrative. fuels false grievances motivate people kill. act like war United States Islam, we're going lose Americans terrorist attacks, we’ll lose sight principles claim defend. let final words Commander-in-Chief reminder you're fighting for, fighting for.

We’re country bled struggled sacrificed kind discrimination arbitrary rule, country world. We’re nation believes freedom taken granted responsibility sustain it. universal right speak mind protest authority, live society that’s open free, criticize retribution -- country you're judged content character look like, worship, is, family came -- that's separates tyrants terrorists. nation stands rule law, strengthen laws war. Nazis defeated, trial. couldn’t understand that; happened before. American lawyers Nuremberg says, “I trying prove rule law govern human behavior.” so, broadened scope reach justice world. held beacon example others. nation won World Wars grabbing resources defeated. helped rebuild. didn't hold territory, cemeteries buried dead. Greatest Generation fought bled died build international order laws institutions preserve peace, extend prosperity, promote cooperation nations. imperfections, depend international order protect freedom. words, nation best defined hope, fear. country went crucible Civil War offer new birth freedom; stormed beaches Normandy, climbed hills Iwo Jima; saw ordinary people mobilize extend meaning civil rights.

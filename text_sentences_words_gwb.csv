"Thank you for coming. Prime Minister Olmert, President Abbas, Secretary-General Ban, former Prime Minister Blair, distinguished guests: Welcome to one of the finest institutes we have in America, the United States Naval Academy. We appreciate you joining us in what I believe is an historic opportunity to encourage the expansion of freedom and peace in the Holy Land. We meet to lay the foundation for the establishment of a new nation, a democratic Palestinian state that will live side by side with Israel in peace and security. We meet to help bring an end to the violence that has been the true enemy of the aspirations of both the Israelis and Palestinians. We're off to a strong start. I'm about to read a statement that was agreed upon by our distinguished guests. ""The representatives of the Government of the State of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, represented respective by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas in his capacity as Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee and President of the Palestinian Authority, have convened in Annapolis, Maryland, under the auspices of President George W. Bush of the United States of America, and with the support of the participants of this international conference, having concluded the following joint understanding. ""We express our determination to bring an end to bloodshed, suffering, and decades of conflict between our peoples; to usher in a new era of peace, based on freedom, security, justice, dignity, respect, and mutual recognition; to propagate a culture of peace and nonviolence; to confront terrorism and incitement, whether committed by Palestinians or Israelis. In furtherance of the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, we agree to immediately launch good-faith bilateral negotiations in order to conclude a peace treaty, resolving all outstanding issues, including all core issues, without exception, as specified in previous agreements. ""We agree to engage in vigorous, ongoing, and continuous negotiations and shall make every effort to conclude an agreement before the end of 2008. For this purpose, a steering committee, led jointly by the head of the delegation of each party, will meet continuously, as agreed. The steering committee will develop a joint work plan and establish and oversee the work of negotiations teams to address all issues, to be headed by one lead representative from each party. The first session of the steering committee will be held on 12 December 2007. ""President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert will continue to meet on a biweekly basis to follow up the negotiations in order to offer all necessary assistance for their advancement. ""The parties also commit to immediately implement their respective obligations under the performance-based roadmap to a permanent two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, issued by the Quartet on 30 April 2003—this is called the roadmap—and agree to form an American, Palestinian, and Israeli mechanism, led by the United States, to follow up on the implementation of the roadmap. ""The parties further commit to continue the implementation of the ongoing obligations of the roadmap until they reach a peace treaty. The United States will monitor and judge the fulfillment of the commitment of both sides of the roadmap. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, implementation of the future peace treaty will be subject to the implementation of the roadmap as judged by the United States."" Congratulations for your strong leadership. The Palestinian people are blessed with many gifts and talents. They want the opportunity to use those gifts to better their own lives and build a future for their children. They want the dignity that comes with sovereignty and independence. They want justice and equality under the rule of law. They want freedom from violence and fear. The people of Israel have just aspirations as well. They want their children to be able to ride a bus or to go to school without fear of suicide bombers. They want an end to rocket attacks and constant threats of assault. They want their nation to be recognized and welcomed in the region where they live. Today, Palestinians and Israelis each understand that helping the other to realize their aspirations is key to realizing their own aspirations, both require an independent, democratic, viable Palestinian state. Such a state will provide Palestinians with the chance to lead lives of freedom and purpose and dignity. Such a state will help provide the Israelis with something they have been seeking for generations: to live in peace with their neighbors. Achieving this goal is not going to be easy. If it were easy, it would have happened a long time ago. To achieve freedom and peace, both Israelis and Palestinians will have to make tough choices. Both sides are sober about the work ahead, but having spent time with their leaders, they are ready to take on the tough issues. As Prime Minister Olmert recently put it: ""We will avoid none of the historic questions; we will not run from discussing any of them."" As President Abbas has said: ""I believe that there is an opportunity not only for us but for the Israelis too. We have a historic and important opportunity that we must benefit from."" It is with that spirit that we concluded—that they concluded this statement I just read. Our purpose here in Annapolis is not to conclude an agreement. Rather, it is to launch negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. For the rest of us, our job is to encourage the parties in this effort and to give them the support they need to succeed. In light of recent developments, some have suggested that now is not the right time to pursue peace. I disagree. I believe now is precisely the right time to begin these negotiations for a number of reasons. First, the time is right because Palestinians and Israelis have leaders who are determined to achieve peace. President Abbas seeks to fulfill his people's aspirations for statehood, dignity, and security. President Abbas understands that a Palestinian state will not be born of terror and that terrorism is the enemy standing in the way of a state. He and Prime Minister Fayyad have both declared, without hesitation, that they are opposed to terrorism and committed to peace. They're committed to turning these declarations into actions on the ground to combat terror. The emergence of responsible Palestinian leaders has given Israeli leaders the confidence they need to reach out to the Palestinians in true partnership. Prime Minister Olmert has expressed his understanding of the suffering and indignities felt by the Palestinian people. He's made clear that the security of Israel will be enhanced by the establishment of a responsible, democratic Palestinian state. With leaders of courage and conviction on both sides, now is the time to come together and seek the peace that both sides desire. Second, the time is right because a battle is underway for the future of the Middle East, and we must not cede victory to the extremists. With their violent actions and contempt for human life, the extremists are seeking to impose a dark vision on the Palestinian people, a vision that feeds on hopelessness and despair to sow chaos in the Holy Land. If this vision prevails, the future of the region will be endless terror, endless war, and endless suffering. Standing against this dark vision are President Abbas and his Government. They are offering the Palestinian people an alternative vision for the future: a vision of peace, a homeland of their own, and a better life. If responsible Palestinian leaders can deliver on this vision, they will deal the forces of extremism a devastating blow. And when liberty takes root in the rocky soil of the West Bank and Gaza, it will inspire millions across the Middle East who want their societies built on freedom and peace and hope. By contrast, if Palestinian reformers cannot deliver on this hopeful vision, then the forces of extremism and terror will be strengthened, a generation of Palestinians could be lost to the extremists, and the Middle East will grow in despair. We cannot allow this to happen. Now is the time to show Palestinians that their dream of a free and independent state can be achieved at the table of peace and that the terror and violence preached by Palestinian extremists is the greatest obstacle to a Palestinian state. Third, the time is right because the world understands the urgency of supporting these negotiations. We appreciate that representatives from so many governments and international institutions have come to join us here in Annapolis, especially the Arab world. We're here because we recognize what is at stake. We are here because we each have a vital role to play in helping Palestinians forge the institutions of a free society. We're here because we understand that the success of these efforts to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians will have an impact far beyond the Holy Land. These are the reasons we've gathered here in Annapolis, and now we begin the difficult work of freedom and peace. The United States is proud to host this meeting, and we reaffirm the path to peace set out in the roadmap. Yet in the end, the outcome of the negotiations they launch here depends on the Israelis and Palestinians themselves. America will do everything in our power to support their quest for peace, but we cannot achieve it for them. The success of these efforts will require that all parties show patience and flexibility and meet their responsibilities. For these negotiations to succeed, the Palestinians must do their part. They must show the world they understand that while the borders of a Palestinian state are important, the nature of a Palestinian state is just as important. They must demonstrate that a Palestinian state will create opportunity for all its citizens and govern justly and dismantle the infrastructure of terror. They must show that a Palestinian state will accept its responsibility and have the capability to be a source of stability and peace for its own citizens, for the people of Israel, and for the whole region. The Israelis must do their part. They must show the world that they are ready to begin—to bring an end to the occupation that began in 1967 through a negotiated settlement. This settlement will establish Palestine as a Palestinian homeland, just as Israel is a homeland for the Jewish people. Israel must demonstrate its support for the creation of a prosperous and successful Palestinian state by removing unauthorized outposts, ending settlement expansion, and finding other ways for the Palestinian Authority to exercise its responsibilities without compromising Israel's security. Arab States also have a vital role to play. Relaunching the Arab League initiative and the Arab League's support for today's conference are positive steps. All Arab States should show their strong support for the Government of President Abbas and provide needed assistance to the Palestinian Authority. Arab States should also reach out to Israel, work toward the normalization of relations, and demonstrate in both word and deed that they believe that Israel and its people have a permanent home in the Middle East. These are vital steps toward the comprehensive peace that we all seek. Finally, the international community has important responsibilities. Prime Minister Fayyad is finalizing a plan to increase openness and transparency and accountability throughout Palestinian society, and he needs the resources and support from the international community. With strong backing from those gathered here, the Palestinian Government can build the free institutions that will support a free Palestinian state. The United States will help Palestinian leaders build these free institutions. And the United States will keep its commitment to the security of Israel as a Jewish state and homeland for the Jewish people. The United States strongly feels that these efforts will yield the peace that we want, and that is why we will continue to support the Lebanese people. We believe democracy brings peace. And democracy in Lebanon is vital as well for the peace in the Middle East. Lebanese people are in the process of electing a President. That decision is for the Lebanese people to make, and they must be able to do so free from outside interference and intimidation. As they embark on this process, the people of Lebanon can know that the American people stand with them, and we look forward to the day when the people of Lebanon can enjoy the blessings of liberty without fear of violence or coercion. The task begun here at Annapolis will be difficult. This is the beginning of the process, not the end of it, and no doubt a lot of work remains to be done. Yet the parties can approach this work with confidence. The time is right. The cause is just. And with hard effort, I know they can succeed. President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert, I pledge to devote my effort during my time as President to do all I can to help you achieve this ambitious goal. I give you my personal commitment to support your work with the resources and resolve of the American Government. I believe a day is coming when freedom will yield the peace we desire. And the land that is holy to so many will see the light of peace. The day is coming when Palestinians will enjoy the blessings that freedom brings and all Israelis will enjoy the security they deserve. That day is coming. The day is coming when the terrorists and extremists who threaten the Israeli and Palestinian people will be marginalized and eventually defeated. And when that day comes, future generations will look to the work we began here at Annapolis. They will give thanks to the leaders who gathered on the banks of the Chesapeake for their vision, their wisdom, and courage to choose a future of freedom and peace. Thanks for coming. May God bless their work.",remarks-the-annapolis-conference-annapolis-maryland.txt,55,thank you for coming prime minister olmert president abbas secretary general ban former prime minister blair

Prime Minister Blair, distinguished guests: Welcome to one of the finest institutes we have in America, the United States Naval Academy.', 'We appreciate you joining us in what I believe is an historic opportunity to encourage the expansion of freedom and peace in the Holy Land.', 'We meet to lay the foundation for the establishment of a new nation, a democratic Palestinian state that will live side by side with Israel in peace and security.', 'We meet to help bring an end to the violence that has been the true enemy of the aspirations of both the Israelis and Palestinians.', ""We're off to a strong start."", ""I'm about to read a statement that was agreed upon by our distinguished guests."", '""The representatives of the Government of the State of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, represented respective by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas in his capacity as Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee and President of the Palestinian Authority, have convened in Annapolis, Maryland, under the auspices of President George W. Bush of the United States of America, and with the support of the participants of this international conference, having concluded the following joint understanding.', '""We express our determination to bring an end to bloodshed, suffering, and decades of conflict between our peoples; to usher in a new era of peace, based on freedom, security, justice, dignity, respect, and mutual recognition; to propagate a culture of peace and nonviolence; to confront terrorism and incitement, whether committed by Palestinians or Israelis.', 'In furtherance of the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, we agree to immediately launch good-faith bilateral negotiations in order to conclude a peace treaty, resolving all outstanding issues, including all core issues, without exception, as specified in previous agreements.', '""We agree to engage in vigorous, ongoing, and continuous negotiations and shall make every effort to conclude an agreement before the end of 2008.', 'For this purpose, a steering committee, led jointly by the head of the delegation of each party, will meet continuously, as agreed.', 'The steering committee will develop a joint work plan and establish and oversee the work of negotiations teams to address all issues, to be headed by one lead representative from each party.', 'The first session of the steering committee will be held on 12 December 2007.', '""President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert will continue to meet on a biweekly basis to follow up the negotiations in order to offer all necessary assistance for their advancement.', '""The parties also commit to immediately implement their respective obligations under the performance-based roadmap to a permanent two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, issued by the Quartet on 30 April 2003—this is called the roadmap—and agree to form an American, Palestinian, and Israeli mechanism, led by the United States, to follow up on the implementation of the roadmap.', '""The parties further commit to continue the implementation of the ongoing obligations of the roadmap until they reach a peace treaty.', 'The United States will monitor and judge the fulfillment of the commitment of both sides of the roadmap.', 'Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, implementation of the future peace treaty will be subject to the implementation of the roadmap as judged by the United States.""', 'Congratulations for your strong leadership.', 'The Palestinian people are blessed with many gifts and talents.', 'They want the opportunity to use those gifts to better their own lives and build a future for their children.', 'They want the dignity that comes with sovereignty and independence.', 'They want justice and equality under the rule of law.', 'They want freedom from violence and fear.', 'The people of Israel have just aspirations as well.', 'They want their children to be able to ride a bus or to go to school without fear of suicide bombers.', 'They want an end to rocket attacks and constant threats of assault.', 'They want their nation to be recognized and welcomed in the region where they live.', 'Today, Palestinians and Israelis each understand that helping the other to realize their aspirations is key to realizing their own aspirations, both require an independent, democratic, viable Palestinian state.', 'Such a state will provide Palestinians with the chance to lead lives of freedom and purpose and dignity.', 'Such a state will help provide the Israelis with something they have been seeking for generations: to live in peace with their neighbors.', 'Achieving this goal is not going to be easy.', 'If it were easy, it would have happened a long time ago.', 'To achieve freedom and peace, both Israelis and Palestinians will have to make tough choices.', 'Both sides are sober about the work ahead, but having spent time with their leaders, they are ready to take on the tough issues.', 'As Prime Minister Olmert recently put it: ""We will avoid none of the historic questions; we will not run from discussing any of them.""', 'As President Abbas has said: ""I believe that there is an opportunity not only for us but for the Israelis too.', 'We have a historic and important opportunity that we must benefit from.""', 'It is with that spirit that we concluded—that they concluded this statement I just read.', 'Our purpose here in Annapolis is not to conclude an agreement.', 'Rather, it is to launch negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.', 'For the rest of us, our job is to encourage the parties in this effort and to give them the support they need to succeed.', 'In light of recent developments, some have suggested that now is not the right time to pursue peace.', 'I disagree.', 'I believe now is precisely the right time to begin these negotiations for a number of reasons.', 'First, the time is right because Palestinians and Israelis have leaders who are determined to achieve peace.', ""President Abbas seeks to fulfill his people's aspirations for statehood, dignity, and security."", 'President Abbas understands that a Palestinian state will not be born of terror and that terrorism is the enemy standing in the way of a state.', 'He and Prime Minister Fayyad have both declared, without hesitation, that they are opposed to terrorism and committed to peace.', ""They're committed to turning these declarations into actions on the ground to combat terror."", 'The emergence of responsible Palestinian leaders has given Israeli leaders the confidence they need to reach out to the Palestinians in true partnership.', 'Prime Minister Olmert has expressed his understanding of the suffering and indignities felt by the Palestinian people.', ""He's made clear that the security of Israel will be enhanced by the establishment of a responsible, democratic Palestinian state."", 'With leaders of courage and conviction on both sides, now is the time to come together and seek the peace that both sides desire.', 'Second, the time is right because a battle is underway for the future of the Middle East, and we must not cede victory to the extremists.', 'With their violent actions and contempt for human life, the extremists are seeking to impose a dark vision on the Palestinian people, a vision that feeds on hopelessness and despair to sow chaos in the Holy Land.', 'If this vision prevails, the future of the region will be endless terror, endless war, and endless suffering.', 'Standing against this dark vision are President Abbas and his Government.', 'They are offering the Palestinian people an alternative vision for the future: a vision of peace, a homeland of their own, and a better life.', 'If responsible Palestinian leaders can deliver on this vision, they will deal the forces of extremism a devastating blow.', 'And when liberty takes root in the rocky soil of the West Bank and Gaza, it will inspire millions across the Middle East who want their societies built on freedom and peace and hope.', 'By contrast, if Palestinian reformers cannot deliver on this hopeful vision, then the forces of extremism and terror will be strengthened, a generation of Palestinians could be lost to the extremists, and the Middle East will grow in despair.', 'We cannot allow this to happen.', 'Now is the time to show Palestinians that their dream of a free and independent state can be achieved at the table of peace and that the terror and violence preached by Palestinian extremists is the greatest obstacle to a Palestinian state.', 'Third, the time is right because the world understands the urgency of supporting these negotiations.', 'We appreciate that representatives from so many governments and international institutions have come to join us here in Annapolis, especially the Arab world.', ""We're here because we recognize what is at stake."", 'We are here because we each have a vital role to play in helping Palestinians forge the institutions of a free society.', ""We're here because we understand that the success of these efforts to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians will have an impact far beyond the Holy Land."", ""These are the reasons we've gathered here in Annapolis, and now we begin the difficult work of freedom and peace."", 'The United States is proud to host this meeting, and we reaffirm the path to peace set out in the roadmap.', 'Yet in the end, the outcome of the negotiations they launch here depends on the Israelis and Palestinians themselves.', 'America will do everything in our power to support their quest for peace, but we cannot achieve it for them.', 'The success of these efforts will require that all parties show patience and flexibility and meet their responsibilities.', 'For these negotiations to succeed, the Palestinians must do their part.', 'They must show the world they understand that while the borders of a Palestinian state are important, the nature of a Palestinian state is just as important.', 'They must demonstrate that a Palestinian state will create opportunity for all its citizens and govern justly and dismantle the infrastructure of terror.', 'They must show that a Palestinian state will accept its responsibility and have the capability to be a source of stability and peace for its own citizens, for the people of Israel, and for the whole region.', 'The Israelis must do their part.', 'They must show the world that they are ready to begin—to bring an end to the occupation that began in 1967 through a negotiated settlement.', 'This settlement will establish Palestine as a Palestinian homeland, just as Israel is a homeland for the Jewish people.', ""Israel must demonstrate its support for the creation of a prosperous and successful Palestinian state by removing unauthorized outposts, ending settlement expansion, and finding other ways for the Palestinian Authority to exercise its responsibilities without compromising Israel's security."", 'Arab States also have a vital role to play.', ""Relaunching the Arab League initiative and the Arab League's support for today's conference are positive steps."", 'All Arab States should show their strong support for the Government of President Abbas and provide needed assistance to the Palestinian Authority.', 'Arab States should also reach out to Israel, work toward the normalization of relations, and demonstrate in both word and deed that they believe that Israel and its people have a permanent home in the Middle East.', 'These are vital steps toward the comprehensive peace that we all seek.', 'Finally, the international community has important responsibilities.', 'Prime Minister Fayyad is finalizing a plan to increase openness and transparency and accountability throughout Palestinian society, and he needs the resources and support from the international community.', 'With strong backing from those gathered here, the Palestinian Government can build the free institutions that will support a free Palestinian state.', 'The United States will help Palestinian leaders build these free institutions.', 'And the United States will keep its commitment to the security of Israel as a Jewish state and homeland for the Jewish people.', 'The United States strongly feels that these efforts will yield the peace that we want, and that is why we will continue to support the Lebanese people.', 'We believe democracy brings peace.', 'And democracy in Lebanon is vital as well for the peace in the Middle East.', 'Lebanese people are in the process of electing a President.', 'That decision is for the Lebanese people to make, and they must be able to do so free from outside interference and intimidation.', 'As they embark on this process, the people of Lebanon can know that the American people stand with them, and we look forward to the day when the people of Lebanon can enjoy the blessings of liberty without fear of violence or coercion.', 'The task begun here at Annapolis will be difficult.', 'This is the beginning of the process, not the end of it, and no doubt a lot of work remains to be done.', 'Yet the parties can approach this work with confidence.', 'The time is right.', 'The cause is just.', 'And with hard effort, I know they can succeed.', 'President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert, I pledge to devote my effort during my time as President to do all I can to help you achieve this ambitious goal.', 'I give you my personal commitment to support your work with the resources and resolve of the American Government.', 'I believe a day is coming when freedom will yield the peace we desire.', 'And the land that is holy to so many will see the light of peace.', 'The day is coming when Palestinians will enjoy the blessings that freedom brings and all Israelis will enjoy the security they deserve.', 'That day is coming.', 'The day is coming when the terrorists and extremists who threaten the Israeli and Palestinian people will be marginalized and eventually defeated.', 'And when that day comes, future generations will look to the work we began here at Annapolis.', 'They will give thanks to the leaders who gathered on the banks of the Chesapeake for their vision, their wisdom, and courage to choose a future of freedom and peace.', 'Thanks for coming.', 'May God bless their work.']","['Thank', 'you', 'for', 'coming.', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Olmert', ',', 'President', 'Abbas', ',', 'Secretary-General', 'Ban', ',', 'former', 'Prime',

"Good evening. During the next few minutes, I want to update you on the progress we are making in our war against terror and to propose sweeping changes that will strengthen our homeland against the ongoing threat of terrorist attacks. Nearly 9 months have passed since the day that forever changed our country. Debris from what was once the World Trade Center has been cleared away in a hundred thousand truckloads. The west side of the Pentagon looks almost as it did on September the 10th. And as children finish school and families prepare for summer vacations, for many life seems almost normal. Yet, we are a different nation today, sadder and stronger, less innocent and more courageous, more appreciative of life, and for many who serve our country, more willing to risk life in a great cause. For those who have lost family and friends, the pain will never go away, and neither will the responsibilities that day thrust upon all of us. America is leading the civilized world in a titanic struggle against terror. Freedom and fear are at war, and freedom is winning. Tonight over 60,000 American troops are deployed around the world in the war against terror: more than 7,000 in Afghanistan; others in the Philippines, Yemen, and the Republic of Georgia, to train local forces. Next week Afghanistan will begin selecting a representative government, even as American troops, along with our allies, still continuously raid remote Al Qaida hiding places. Among those we have captured is a man named Abu Zubaydah, Al Qaida's chief of operations. From him and from hundreds of others, we are learning more about how the terrorists plan and operate, information crucial in anticipating and preventing future attacks. Our coalition is strong. More than 90 nations have arrested or detained over 2,400 terrorists and their supporters. More than 180 countries have offered or are providing assistance in the war on terrorism. And our military is strong and prepared to oppose any emerging threat to the American people. Every day in this war will not bring the drama of liberating a country. Yet, every day brings new information, a tip or arrest, another step or two or three in a relentless march to bring security to our Nation and justice to our enemies. Every day I review a document called the threat assessment. It summarizes what our intelligence services and key law enforcement agencies have picked up about terrorist activity. Sometimes the information is very general, vague talk, bragging about future attacks. Sometimes the information is more specific, as in a recent case when an Al Qaida detainee said attacks were planned against financial institutions. When credible intelligence warrants, appropriate law enforcement and local officials are alerted. These warnings are, unfortunately, a new reality in American life, and we have recently seen an increase in the volume of general threats. Americans should continue to do what you're doing. Go about your lives, but pay attention to your surroundings. Add your eyes and ears to the protection of our homeland. In protecting our country, we depend on the skill of our people, the troops we send to battle, intelligence operatives who risk their lives for bits of information, law enforcement officers who sift for clues and search for suspects. We are now learning that before September the 11th, the suspicions and insights of some of our frontline agents did not get enough attention. My administration supports the important work of the intelligence committees in Congress to review the activities of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. We need to know when warnings were missed or signs unheeded, not to point the finger or blame but to make sure we correct any problems and prevent them from happening again. Based on everything I've seen, I do not believe anyone could have prevented the horror of September the 11th. Yet, we now know that thousands of trained killers are plotting to attack us, and this terrible knowledge requires us to act differently. If you're a frontline worker for the FBI, the CIA, some other law enforcement or intelligence agency and you see something that raises suspicions, I want you to report it immediately. I expect your supervisors to treat it with the seriousness it deserves. Information must be fully shared so we can follow every lead to find the one that may prevent tragedy. I applaud the leaders and employees at the FBI and CIA for beginning essential reforms. They must continue to think and act differently to defeat the enemy. The first and best way to secure America's homeland is to attack the enemy where he hides and plans, and we're doing just that. We're also taking significant steps to strengthen our homeland protections, securing cockpits, tightening our borders, stockpiling vaccines, increasing security at water treatment and nuclear powerplants. After September the 11th, we needed to move quickly, and so I appointed Tom Ridge as my Homeland Security Adviser. As Governor Ridge has worked with all levels of government to prepare a national strategy and as we have learned more about the plans and capabilities of the terrorist network, we have concluded that our Government must be reorganized to deal more effectively with the new threats of the 21st century. So tonight I ask the Congress to join me in creating a single, permanent department with an overriding and urgent mission, securing the homeland of America and protecting the American people. Right now as many as a hundred different Government agencies have some responsibilities for homeland security, and no one has final accountability. For example, the Coast Guard has several missions, from search and rescue to maritime treaty enforcement. It reports to the Transportation Department, whose primary responsibilities are roads, rails, bridges, and the airways. The Customs Service, among other duties, collects tariffs and prevents smuggling, and it is part of the Treasury Department, whose primary responsibility is fiscal policy, not security. Tonight I propose a permanent Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security to unite essential agencies that must work more closely together: Among them, the Coast Guard, the Border Patrol, the Customs Service, Immigration officials, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Employees of this new agency will come to work every morning knowing their most important job is to protect their fellow citizens. The Department of Homeland Security will be charged with four primary tasks: This new agency will control our borders and prevent terrorists and explosives from entering our country; it will work with State and local authorities to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies; it will bring together our best scientists to develop technologies that detect biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons, and to discover the drugs and treatments to best protect our citizens; and this new Department will review intelligence and law enforcement information from all agencies of Government and produce a single daily picture of threats against our homeland. Analysts will be responsible for imagining the worst and planning to counter it. The reason to create this Department is not to create the size of Government but to increase its focus and effectiveness. The staff of this new Department will be largely drawn from the agencies we are combining. By ending duplication and overlap, we will spend less on overhead and more on protecting America. This reorganization will give the good people of our Government their best opportunity to succeed by organizing our resources in a way that is thorough and unified. What I am proposing tonight is the most extensive reorganization of the Federal Government since the 1940s. During his Presidency, Harry Truman recognized that our Nation's fragmented defenses had to be reorganized to win the cold war. He proposed uniting our military forces under a single Department of Defense and creating the National Security Council to bring together defense, intelligence, and diplomacy. Truman's reforms are still helping us to fight terror abroad, and now we need similar dramatic reforms to secure our people at home. Only the United States Congress can create a new department of Government. So tonight I ask for your help in encouraging your Representatives to support my plan. We face an urgent need, and we must move quickly, this year, before the end of the congressional session. All in our Government have learned a great deal since September the 11th, and we must act on every lesson. We are stronger and better prepared tonight than we were on that terrible morning, and with your help and the support of the Congress, we will be stronger still. History has called our Nation into action. History has placed a great challenge before us: Will America, with our unique position and power, blink in the face of terror, or will we lead to a freer, more civilized world? There's only one answer: This great country will lead the world to safety, security, peace, and freedom. Thank you for listening. Good night, and may God bless America.",address-the-nation-the-proposed-department-homeland-security.txt,13,good evening during the next few minutes i want to update you on the progress we are making in our war against terror and to propose sweeping changes that will strengthen our homeland against the ongoing threat of terrorist attacks nearly 9 months have passed since the day that forever changed our country debris from what was once the world trade center has been cleared away in a hundred thousand truckloads the west side of the pentagon looks almost as it did on september the 10th and as children finish school and families prepare for summer vacations for many life seems almost normal yet we are a different nation today sadder and stronger less innocent and more courageous more appreciative of life and for many who serve our country more willing to risk life in a great cause for those who have lost family and friends the pain will never go away and neither will the responsibilities that day thrust upon all of us america is leading the civilized world in a titanic struggle against terror freedom and fear are at war and freedom is winning tonight over 60 000 american troops are deployed around the world in the war against terror more than 7 000 in afghanistan others in the philippines yemen and the republic of georgia to train local forces next week afghanistan will begin selecting a representative government even as american troops along with our allies still continuously raid remote al qaida hiding places among those we have captured is a man named abu zubaydah al qaida's chief of operations from him and from hundreds of others we are learning more about how the terrorists plan and operate information crucial in anticipating and preventing future attacks our coalition is strong more than 90 nations have arrested or detained over 2 400 terrorists and their supporters more than 180 countries have offered or are providing assistance in the war on terrorism and our military is strong and prepared to oppose any emerging threat to the american people every day in this war will not bring the drama of liberating a country yet every day brings new information a tip or arrest another step or two or three in a relentless march to bring security to our nation and justice to our enemies every day i review a document called the threat assessment it summarizes what our intelligence services and key law enforcement agencies have picked up about terrorist activity sometimes the information is very general vague talk bragging about future attacks sometimes the information is more specific as in a recent case when an al qaida detainee said attacks were planned against financial institutions when credible intelligence warrants appropriate law enforcement and local officials are alerted these warnings are unfortunately a new reality in american life and we have recently seen an increase in the volume of general threats americans should continue to do what you're doing go about your lives but pay attention to your surroundings add your eyes and ears to the protection of our homeland in protecting our country we depend on the skill of our people the troops we send to battle intelligence operatives who risk their lives for bits of information law enforcement officers who sift for clues and search for suspects we are now learning that before september the 11th the suspicions and insights of some of our frontline agents did not get enough attention my administration supports the important work of the intelligence committees in congress to review the activities of law enforcement and intelligence agencies we need to know when warnings were missed or signs unheeded not to point the finger or blame but to make sure we correct any problems and prevent them from happening again based on everything i've seen i do not believe anyone could have prevented the horror of september the 11th yet we now know that thousands of trained killers are plotting to attack us and this terrible knowledge requires us to act differently if you're a frontline worker for the fbi the cia some other law enforcement or intelligence agency and you see something that raises suspicions i want you to report it immediately i expect your supervisors to treat it with the seriousness it deserves information must be fully shared so we can follow every lead to find the one that may prevent tragedy i applaud the leaders and employees at the fbi and cia for beginning essential reforms they must continue to think and act differently to defeat the enemy the first and best way to secure america's homeland is to attack the enemy where he hides and plans and we're doing just that we're also taking significant steps to strengthen our homeland protections securing cockpits tightening our borders stockpiling vaccines increasing security at water treatment and nuclear powerplants after september the 11th we needed to move quickly and so i appointed tom ridge as my homeland security adviser as governor ridge has worked with all levels of government to prepare a national strategy and as we have learned more about the plans and capabilities of the terrorist network we have concluded that our government must be reorganized to deal more effectively with the new threats of the 21st century so tonight i ask the congress to join me in creating a single permanent department with an overriding and urgent mission securing the homeland of america and protecting the american people right now as many as a hundred different government agencies have some responsibilities for homeland security and no one has final accountability for example the coast guard has several missions from search and rescue to maritime treaty enforcement it reports to the transportation department whose primary responsibilities are roads rails bridges and the airways the customs service among other duties collects tariffs and prevents smuggling and it is part of the treasury department whose primary responsibility is fiscal policy not security tonight i propose a permanent cabinet level department of homeland security to unite essential agencies that must work more closely together among them the coast guard the border patrol the customs service immigration officials the transportation security administration and the federal emergency management agency employees of this new agency will come to work every morning knowing their most important job is to protect their fellow citizens the department of homeland security will be charged with four primary tasks this new agency will control our borders and prevent terrorists and explosives from entering our country it will work with state and local authorities to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies it will bring together our best scientists to develop technologies that detect biological chemical and nuclear weapons and to discover the drugs and treatments to best protect our citizens and this new department will review intelligence and law enforcement information from all agencies of government and produce a single daily picture of threats against our homeland analysts will be responsible for imagining the worst and planning to counter it the reason to create this department is not to create the size of government but to increase its focus and effectiveness the staff of this new department will be largely drawn from the agencies we are combining by ending duplication and overlap we will spend less on overhead and more on protecting america this reorganization will give the good people of our government their best opportunity to succeed by organizing our resources in a way that is thorough and unified what i am proposing tonight is the most extensive reorganization of the federal government since the 1940s during his presidency harry truman recognized that our nation's fragmented defenses had to be reorganized to win the cold war he proposed uniting our military forces under a single department of defense and creating the national security council to bring together defense intelligence and diplomacy truman's reforms are still helping us to fight terror abroad and now we need similar dramatic reforms to secure our people at home only the united states congress can create a new department of government so tonight i ask for your help in encouraging your representatives to support my plan we face an urgent need and we must move quickly this year before the end of the congressional session all in our government have learned a great deal since september the 11th and we must act on every lesson we are stronger and better prepared tonight than we were on that terrible morning and with your help and the support of the congress we will be stronger still history has called our nation into action history has placed a great challenge before us will america with our unique position

"Our Nation is shocked and saddened by the news of the shootings at Virginia Tech today. The exact total has not yet been confirmed, but it appears that more than 30 people were killed and many more were wounded. I've spoken with Governor Tim Kaine and Virginia Tech President Charles Steger. I told them that Laura and I and many across our Nation are praying for the victims and their families and all the members of the university community who have been devastated by this terrible tragedy. I told them that my administration would do everything possible to assist with the investigation, and that I pledged that we would stand ready to help local law enforcement and the local community in any way we can during this time of sorrow. Schools should be places of safety and sanctuary and learning. When that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom and every American community. Today our Nation grieves with those who have lost loved ones at Virginia Tech. We hold the victims in our hearts, we lift them up in our prayers, and we ask a loving God to comfort those who are suffering today.

"This is George W. Bush, the President of the United States. At this moment, the regime of Saddam Hussein is being removed from power, and a long era of fear and cruelty is ending. American and coalition forces are now operating inside Baghdad, and we will not stop until Saddam's corrupt gang is gone. The Government of Iraq and the future of your country will soon belong to you. The goals of our coalition are clear and limited. We will end a brutal regime, whose aggression and weapons of mass destruction make it a unique threat to the world. Coalition forces will help maintain law and order so that Iraqis can live in security. We will respect your great religious traditions, whose principles of equality and compassion are essential to Iraq's future. We will help you build a peaceful and representative government that protects the rights of all citizens. And then our military forces will leave. Iraq will go forward as a unified, independent, and sovereign nation that has regained a respected place in the world. The United States and its coalition partners respect the people of Iraq. We are taking unprecedented measures to spare the lives of innocent Iraqi citizens. We are beginning to deliver food and water and medicine to those in need. Our only enemy is Saddam and his brutal regime, and that regime is your enemy as well. In the new era that is coming to Iraq, your country will no longer be held captive to the will of a cruel dictator. You will be free—free to build a better life instead of building more palaces for Saddam and his sons, free to pursue economic prosperity without the hardship of economic sanctions, free to travel and free to speak your mind, free to join in the political affairs of Iraq. And all the people who make up your country—Kurds, Shi'a, Turkomans, Sunnis, and others—will be free of the terrible persecution that so many have endured. The nightmare that Saddam Hussein has brought to your nation will soon be over. You are a good and gifted people, the heirs of a great civilization that contributes to all humanity. You deserve better than tyranny and corruption and torture chambers. You deserve to live as free people. And I assure every citizen of Iraq: Your nation will soon be free.

"Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: America this evening is a nation called to great responsibilities, and we are rising to meet them. As we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American service men and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror. By bringing hope to the oppressed and delivering justice to the violent, they are making America more secure. Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger lists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are patrolling our coasts and borders. And their vigilance is protecting America. Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world. The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief you passed is working. Tonight Members of Congress can take pride in the great works of compassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible. You're raising the standards for our public schools, and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under Medicare. We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face a choice: We can go forward with confidence and resolve, or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us. We can press on with economic growth and reforms in education and Medicare, or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions. We've not come all this way, through tragedy and trial and war, only to falter and leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to the tasks of history, and they expect the same from us. In their efforts, their enterprise, and their character, the American people are showing that the state of our Union is confident and strong. Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people. Twenty-eight months have passed since September the 11th, 2001—over 2 years without an attack on American soil. And it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us. That hope is understandable, comforting— and false. The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombasa, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Baghdad. The terrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world. And by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated. Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us. And one of those essential tools is the PATRIOT Act, which allows Federal law enforcement to better share information to track terrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets. For years, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers. If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting terrorists. Key provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire next year. The terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens. You need to renew the PATRIOT Act. America is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war. Last March, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, a mastermind of September the 11th, awoke to find himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani authorities. Last August the 11th brought the capture of the terrorist Hambali, who was a key player in the attack in Indonesia that killed over 200 people. We're tracking Al Qaida around the world, and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed. Thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on the manhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves, and one by one, we will bring these terrorists to justice. As part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists and could supply them with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. The United States and our allies are determined: We refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger. The first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made Afghanistan the primary training base of Al Qaida killers. As of this month, that country has a new constitution guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women. Businesses are opening. Health care centers are being established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan are back in school. With the help from the new Afghan army, our coalition is leading aggressive raids against the surviving members of the Taliban and Al Qaida. The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation that is free and proud and fighting terror, and America is honored to be their friend. Since we last met in this Chamber, combat forces of the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Poland, and other countries enforced the demands of the United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein. And the people of Iraq are free. Having broken the Ba'athist regime, we face a remnant of violent Saddam supporters. Men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows. These killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a serious, continuing danger. Yet we're making progress against them. The once all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole and now sits in a prison cell. Of the top 55 officials of the former regime, we have captured or killed 45. Our forces are on the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day and conducting an average of 180 raids a week. We are dealing with these thugs in Iraq just as surely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein's evil regime. The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last January, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man. Today, our coalition is working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law with a bill of rights. We're working with Iraqis and the United Nations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the end of June. As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear. They are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends, but the United States of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. The killers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom. Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future. And tonight we are honored to welcome one of Iraq's most respected leaders, the current President of the Iraqi Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi. Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation. Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for the better. Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction programs, including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons. Colonel Qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be better off and far more secure without weapons of mass murder. Nine months of intense negotiations involving the United States and Great Britain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not. And one reason is clear: For diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible, and no one can now doubt the word of America. Different threats require different strategies. Along with nations in the region, we're insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear program. America and the international community are demanding that Iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons. America is committed to keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous regimes. When I came to this rostrum on September the 20th, 2001, I brought the police shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end. I gave to you and to all Americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies. And this pledge, given by one, has been kept by many. You in the Congress have provided the resources for our defense and cast the difficult votes of war and peace. Our closest allies have been unwavering. America's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless. And the men and women of the American military—they have taken the hardest duty. We've seen their skill and their courage in armored charges and midnight raids and lonely hours on faithful watch. We have seen the joy when they return and felt the sorrow when one is lost. I've had the honor of meeting our service men and women at many posts, from the deck of a carrier in the Pacific to a mess hall in Baghdad. Many of our troops are listening tonight, and I want you and your families to know: America is proud of you, and my administration and this Congress will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror. I know that some people question if America is really in a war at all. They view terrorism more as a crime, a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments. After the World Trade Center was first attacked in 1993, some of the guilty were indicted and tried and convicted and sent to prison. But the matter was not settled. The terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations and drawing up more ambitious plans. After the chaos and carnage of September the 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers. The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States, and war is what they got. Some in this Chamber and in our country did not support the liberation of Iraq. Objections to war often come from principled motives, but let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power. We're seeking all the facts. Already, the Kay Report identified dozens of weapons-of-mass-destruction-related program activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations. Had we failed to act, the dictator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day. Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been revealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world. Iraq's torture chambers would still be filled with victims, terrified and innocent. The killing fields of Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of men and women and children vanished into the sands, would still be known only to the killers. For all who love freedom and peace, the world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a better and safer place. Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized. This particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in Britain, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands, Norway, El Salvador, and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to Iraq. As we debate at home, we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners or dismiss their sacrifices. From the beginning, America has sought international support for our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much support. There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few. America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country. We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater Middle East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken and condescending to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government. I believe that God has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom, and even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades, it will rise again. As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny and despair and anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of America and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater Middle East. We will challenge the enemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher standard from our friend. To cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian, and soon a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region. I will send you a proposal to double the budget of the National Endowment for Democracy and to focus its new work on the development of free elections and free markets, free press, and free labor unions in the Middle East. And above all, we will finish the historic work of democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq so those nations can light the way for others and help transform a troubled part of the world. America is a nation with a mission, and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire. Our aim is a democratic peace, a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman. America acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side, yet we understand our special calling: This great Republic will lead the cause of freedom. In the last 3 years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the American economy. We have come through recession and terrorist attack and corporate scandals and the uncertainties of war. And because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this economy is strong and growing stronger. You have doubled the child tax credit from 500 to $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, and you have lowered taxes for every American who pays income taxes. Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy forward. The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years; new home construction, the highest in almost 20 years; homeowner-ship rates, the highest ever. Manufacturing activity is increasing. Inflation is low. Interest rates are low. Exports are growing. Productivity is high, and jobs are on the rise. These numbers confirm that the American people are using their money far better than Government would have, and you were right to return it. America's growing economy is also a changing economy. As technology transforms the way almost every job is done, America becomes more productive and workers need new skills. Much of our job growth will be found in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology. So we must respond by helping more Americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy. All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too long, for too many children, those skills were never mastered. By passing the No Child Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country. We're providing more funding for our schools, a 36-percent increase since 2001. We're requiring higher standards. We are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals. We are reporting results to parents and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing. We are making progress toward excellence for every child in America. But the status quo always has defenders. Some want to undermine the No Child Left Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability. Yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense: We expect third graders to read and do math at the third grade level, and that's not asking too much. Testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind. This Nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics. I refuse to give up on any child, and the No Child Left Behind Act is opening the door of opportunity to all of America's children. At the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now. Many of the fastest growing occupations require strong math and science preparation and training beyond the high school level. So tonight, I propose a series of measures called Jobs for the 21st Century. This program will provide extra help to middle and high school students who fall behind in reading and math, expand advanced placement programs in low-income schools, invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in our high schools. I propose larger Pell grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school. I propose increasing our support for America's fine community colleges, so they can—I do so, so they can train workers for industries that are creating the most new jobs. By all these actions, we'll help more and more Americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country. Job training is important, and so is job creation. We must continue to pursue an aggressive, progrowth economic agenda. Congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes. The tax reductions you passed are set to expire. Unless you act, the unfair tax on marriage will go back up. Unless you act, millions of families will be charged $300 more in Federal taxes for every child. Unless you act, small businesses will pay higher taxes. Unless you act, the death tax will eventually come back to life. Unless you act, Americans face a tax increase. What Congress has given, the Congress should not take away. For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed should be permanent. Our agenda for jobs and growth must help small-business owners and employees with relief from needless Federal regulation and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits. Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run, so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote conservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy. My administration is promoting free and fair trade to open up new markets for America's entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers, to create jobs for American workers. Younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirement account. We should make the Social Security system a source of ownership for the American people. And we should limit the burden of Government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayers' dollars. In 2 weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets important domestic needs while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 percent. This will require that Congress focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's money. By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years. Tonight I also ask you to reform our immigration laws so they reflect our values and benefit our economy. I propose a new temporary-worker program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers when no Americans can be found to fill the job. This reform will be good for our economy because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system. A temporary-worker program will help protect our homeland, allowing Border Patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security. I oppose amnesty, because it would encourage further illegal immigration and unfairly reward those who break our laws. My temporary-worker program will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law while bringing millions of hard-working men and women out from the shadows of American life. Our Nation's health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of change. Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives. This dramatic progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance. Members of Congress, we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country. Meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort, and 2 months ago, you showed the way. By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit, you kept a basic commitment to our seniors. You are giving them the modern medicine they deserve. Starting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs, and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional $600 to buy medicine. Beginning next year, seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease, and seniors just entering Medicare can receive wellness exams. In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare. For a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half. Under this reform, senior citizens will be able to keep their Medicare just as it is, or they can choose a Medicare plan that fits them best, just as you, as Members of Congress, can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs. And starting this year, millions of Americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical expenses in a health savings account. I signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors or to take away their prescription drug coverage under Medicare will meet my veto. On the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that Americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs. To make insurance more affordable, Congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs. Small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates, so they can cover more workers with health insurance. I urge you to pass association health plans. I ask you to give lower income Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance. By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs, and improve care. To protect the doctor-patient relationship and keep good doctors doing good work, we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits. And tonight I propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage as part of our new health savings accounts be allowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their taxes. A Government-run health care system is the wrong prescription. By keeping costs under control, expanding access, and helping more Americans afford coverage, we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes America's health care the best in the world. We are living in a time of great change in our world, in our economy, in science and medicine. Yet some things endure: courage and compassion, reverence and integrity, respect for differences of faith and race. The values we try to live by never change, and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions such as families and schools and religious congregations. These institutions, these unseen pillars of civilization, must remain strong in America, and we will defend them. We must stand with our families to help them raise healthy, responsible children. When it comes to helping children make right choices, there is work for all of us to do. One of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and futures on drugs. Our Government is helping parents confront this problem with aggressive education, treatment, and law enforcement. Drug use in high school has declined by 11 percent over the last 2 years. Four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001. In my budget, I propose new funding to continue our aggressive, community-based strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs. Drug testing in our schools has proven to be an effective part of this effort. So tonight I propose an additional 23 million for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children's lives. The aim here is not to punish children but to send them this message: We love you, and we do not want to lose you. To help children make right choices, they need good examples. Athletics play such an important role in our society, but unfortunately, some in professional sports are not setting much of an example. The use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball, football, and other sports is dangerous, and it sends the wrong message, that there are shortcuts to accomplishment and that performance is more important than character. So tonight I call on team owners, union representatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the right signal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now. To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face, even when they're difficult to talk about. Each year, about 3 million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them or kill them or prevent them from ever becoming parents. In my budget, I propose a grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks. We will double Federal funding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact of life: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Decisions children now make can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives. All of us, parents and schools and government, must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture and to send the right messages to our children. A strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization. Congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton. That statute protects marriage under Federal law as a union of a man and a woman and declares that one State may not redefine marriage for other States. Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process. Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage. The outcome of this debate is important, and so is the way we conduct it. The same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in God's sight. It's also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion of America's religious institutions. Religious charities of every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country: mentoring children, feeding the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely. Yet Government has often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups, just because they have a cross or a Star of David or a crescent on the wall. By Executive order, I have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based charities. Tonight I ask you to codify this into law, so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again. In the past, we've worked together to bring mentors to children of prisoners and provide treatment for the addicted and help for the homeless. Tonight I ask you to consider another group of Americans in need of help. This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society. We know from long experience that if they can't find work or a home or help, they are much more likely to commit crime and return to prison. So tonight I propose a 4-year, $300 million prisoner reentry initiative to expand job training and placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups. America is the land of second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life. For all Americans, the last 3 years have brought tests we did not ask for and achievements shared by all. By our actions, we have shown what kind of nation we are. In grief, we have found the grace to go on. In challenge, we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people. In victory, we have shown the noble aims and good heart of America. And having come this far, we sense that we live in a time set apart. I've been witness to the character of the people of America, who have shown calm in times of danger, compassion for one another, and toughness for the long haul. All of us have been partners in a great enterprise. And even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic times. Last month a girl in Lincoln, Rhode Island, sent me a letter. It began, ""Dear George W. Bush. If there's anything you know I, Ashley Pearson, age 10, can do to help anyone, please send me a letter and tell me what I can do to save our country."" She added this P.S.: ""If you can send a letter to the troops, please put, 'Ashley Pearson believes in you.""' Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops has just been conveyed. And yes, you have some duties yourself: Study hard in school; listen to your mom or dad; help someone in need; and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform, say, ""Thank you."" And Ashley, while you do your part, all of us here in this great Chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of America safe and free. My fellow citizens, we now move forward with confidence and faith. Our Nation is strong and steadfast. The cause we serve is right, because it is the cause of all mankind. The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable, and it is not carried forward by our power alone. We can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years. And in all that is to come, we can know that His purposes are just and true. May God continue to bless America.",address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-24.txt,5,mr speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished guests and fellow citizens america this evening is a nation called to great responsibilities and we are rising to meet them as we gather tonight hundreds of thousands of american service men and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror by bringing hope to the oppressed and delivering justice to the violent they are making america more secure each day law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats analysts are examining airline passenger lists the men and women of our new homeland security department are patrolling our coasts and borders and their vigilance is protecting america americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world the american economy is growing stronger the tax relief you passed is working tonight members of congress can take pride in the great works of compassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible you're raising the standards for our public schools and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under medicare we have faced serious challenges together and now we face a choice we can go forward with confidence and resolve or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us we can press on with economic growth and reforms in education and medicare or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions we've not come all this way through tragedy and trial and war only to falter and leave our work unfinished americans are rising to the tasks of history and they expect the same from us in their efforts their enterprise and their character the american people are showing that the state of our union is confident and strong our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the american people twenty eight months have passed since september the 11th 2001'over 2 years without an attack on american soil and it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us that hope is understandable comforting'and false the killing has continued in bali jakarta casablanca riyadh mombasa jerusalem istanbul and baghdad the terrorists continue to plot against america and the civilized world and by our will and courage this danger will be defeated inside the united states where the war began we must continue to give our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us and one of those essential tools is the patriot act which allows federal law enforcement to better share information to track terrorists to disrupt their cells and to seize their assets for years we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers if these methods are good for hunting criminals they are even more important for hunting terrorists key provisions of the patriot act are set to expire next year the terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens you need to renew the patriot act america is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war last march khalid sheik mohammed a mastermind of september the 11th awoke to find himself in the custody of u s and pakistani authorities last august the 11th brought the capture of the terrorist hambali who was a key player in the attack in indonesia that killed over 200 people we're tracking al qaida around the world and nearly two thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on the manhunt going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves and one by one we will bring these terrorists to justice as part of the offensive against terror we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists and could supply them with nuclear chemical or biological weapons the united states and our allies are determined we refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger the first to see our determination were the taliban who made afghanistan the primary training base of al qaida killers as of this month that country has a new constitution guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women businesses are opening health care centers are being established and the boys and girls of afghanistan are back in school with the help from the new afghan army our coalition is leading aggressive raids against the surviving members of the taliban and al qaida the men and women of afghanistan are building a nation that is free and proud and fighting terror and america is honored to be their friend since we last met in this chamber combat forces of the united states great britain australia poland and other countries enforced the demands of the united nations ended the rule of saddam hussein and the people of iraq are free having broken the ba'athist regime we face a remnant of violent saddam supporters men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows these killers joined by foreign terrorists are a serious continuing danger yet we're making progress against them the once all powerful ruler of iraq was found in a hole and now sits in a prison cell of the top 55 officials of the former regime we have captured or killed 45 our forces are on the offensive leading over 1 600 patrols a day and conducting an average of 180 raids a week we are dealing with these thugs in iraq just as surely as we dealt with saddam hussein's evil regime the work of building a new iraq is hard and it is right and america has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right last january iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man today our coalition is working with the iraqi governing council to draft a basic law with a bill of rights we're working with iraqis and the united nations to prepare for a transition to full iraqi sovereignty by the end of june as democracy takes hold in iraq the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear they are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends but the united states of america will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins the killers will fail and the iraqi people will live in freedom month by month iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future and tonight we are honored to welcome one of iraq's most respected leaders the current president of the iraqi governing council adnan pachachi sir america stands with you and the iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation because of american leadership and resolve the world is changing for the better last month the leader of libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction programs including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons colonel qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be better off and far more secure without weapons of mass murder nine months of intense negotiations involving the united states and great britain succeeded with libya while 12 years of diplomacy with iraq did not and one reason is clear for diplomacy to be effective words must be credible and no one can now doubt the word of america different threats require different strategies along with nations in the region we're insisting that north korea eliminate its nuclear program america and the international community are demanding that iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons america is committed to keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous regimes when i came to this rostrum on september the 20th 2001 i brought the police shield of a fallen officer my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end i gave to you and to all americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies and this pledge given by one has been kept by many you in the congress have provided the resources for our defense and cast the difficult votes of war and peace our closest allies have been unwavering america's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless and the men and women of the american military'they have taken the hardest duty we've seen their skill and their courage in armored charges and midnight raids and lonely hours on faithful watch we have seen the joy when they return and felt the sorrow when one is lost i've had the honor of meeting our service men and women at many posts from the deck of a carrier in the pacific to a mess hall in baghdad many of our troops are listening tonight and i want you and your families to know america is proud of you and my administration and this congress will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror i know that some people question if america is really in a war at all they view terrorism more as a crime a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments after the world trade center was first attacked in 1993 some of the guilty were indicted and tried and convicted and sent to prison but the matter was not settled the terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations and drawing up more ambitious plans after the chaos and carnage of september the 11th it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the united states and war is what they got some in this chamber and in our country did not support the liberation of iraq objections to war often come from principled motives but let us be candid about the consequences of leaving saddam hussein in power we're seeking all the facts already the kay report identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction related program activities and significant amounts of equipment that iraq concealed from the united nations had we failed to act the dictator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day had we failed to act security council resolutions on iraq would have been revealed as empty threats weakening the united nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world iraq's torture chambers would still be filled with victims terrified and innocent the killing fields of iraq where hundreds of thousands of men and women and children vanished into the sands would still be known only to the killers for all who love freedom and peace the world without saddam hussein's regime is a better and safer place some critics have said our duties in iraq must be internationalized this particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in britain australia japan south korea the philippines thailand italy spain poland denmark hungary bulgaria ukraine romania the netherlands norway el salvador and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to iraq as we debate at home we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners or dismiss their sacrifices from the beginning america has sought international support for our operations in afghanistan and iraq and we have gained much support there is a difference however between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country we also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater middle east where freedom is rare yet it is mistaken and condescending to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self government i believe that god has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom and even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades it will rise again as long as the middle east remains a place of tyranny and despair and anger it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of america and our friends so america is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater middle east we will challenge the enemies of reform confront the allies of terror and expect a higher standard from our friend to cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda the voice of america and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in arabic and persian and soon a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region i will send you a proposal to double the budget of the national endowment for democracy and to focus its new work on the development of free elections and free markets free press and free labor unions in the middle east and above all we will finish the historic work of democracy in afghanistan and iraq so those nations can light the way for others and help transform a troubled part of the world america is a nation with a mission and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs we have no desire to dominate no ambitions of empire our aim is a democratic peace a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman america acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side yet we understand our special calling this great republic will lead the cause of freedom in the last 3 years adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the american economy we have come through recession and terrorist attack and corporate scandals and the uncertainties of war and because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief this economy is strong and growing stronger you have doubled the child tax credit from 500 to 1 000 reduced the marriage penalty begun to phase out the death tax reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends cut taxes on small businesses and you have lowered taxes for every american who pays income taxes americans took those dollars and put them to work driving this economy forward the pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years new home construction the highest in almost 20 years homeowner ship rates the highest ever manufacturing activity is increasing inflation is low interest rates are low exports are growing productivity is high and jobs are on the rise these numbers confirm that the american people are using their money far better than government would have and you were right to return it america's growing economy is also a changing economy as technology transforms the way almost every job is done america becomes more productive and workers need new skills much of our job growth will be found in high skilled fields like health care and biotechnology so we must respond by helping more americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy all skills begin with the basics of reading and math which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools yet for too long for too many children those skills were never mastered by passing the no child left behind act you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country we're providing more funding for our schools a 36 percent increase since 2001 we're requiring higher standards we are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals we are reporting results to parents and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing we are making progress toward excellence for every child in america but the status quo always has defenders some want to undermine the no child left behind act by weakening standards and accountability yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense we expect third graders to read and do math at the third grade level and that's not asking too much testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind this nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics i refuse to give up on any child and the no child left behind act is opening the door of opportunity to all of america's children at the same time we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now many of the fastest growing occupations require strong math and science preparation and training beyond the high school level so tonight i propose a series of measures called jobs for the 21st century this program will provide extra help to middle and high school students who fall behind in reading and math expand advanced placement programs in low income schools invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach part time in our high schools i propose larger pell grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school i propose increasing our support for america's fine community colleges so they can'i do so so they can train workers for industries that are creating the most new jobs by all these actions we'll help more and more americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country job training is important and so is job creation we must continue to pursue an aggressive progrowth economic agenda congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes the tax reductions you passed are set to expire unless you act the unfair tax on marriage will go back up unless you act millions of families will be charged 300 more in federal taxes for every child unless you act small businesses will pay higher taxes unless you act the death tax will eventually come back to life unless you act americans face a tax increase what congress has given the congress should not take away for the sake of job growth the tax cuts you passed should be permanent our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employees with relief from needless federal regulation and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run so i urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system promote conservation and make america less dependent on foreign sources of energy my administration is promoting free and fair trade to open up new markets for america's entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers to create jobs for american workers younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their social security taxes in a personal retirement account we should make the social security system a source of ownership for the american people and we should limit the burden of government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayers' dollars in 2 weeks i will send you a budget that funds the war protects the homeland and meets important domestic needs while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 percent this will require that congress focus on priorities cut wasteful spending and be wise with the people's money by doing so we can cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years tonight i also ask you to reform our immigration laws so they reflect our values and benefit our economy i propose a new temporary worker program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers when no americans can be found to fill the job this reform will be good for our economy because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system a temporary worker program will help protect our homeland allowing border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security i oppose amnesty because it would encourage further illegal immigration and unfairly reward those who break our laws my temporary worker program will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law while bringing millions of hard working men and women out from the shadows of american life our nation's health care system like our economy is also in a time of change amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives this dramatic progress has brought its own challenge in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance members of congress we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort and 2 months ago you showed the way by strengthening medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit you kept a basic commitment to our seniors you are giving them the modern medicine they deserve starting this year under the law you passed seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs and millions of low income seniors can get an additional 600 to buy medicine beginning next year seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease and seniors just entering medicare can receive wellness exams in january of 2006 seniors can get prescription drug coverage under medicare for a monthly premium of about 35 most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half under this reform senior citizens will be able to keep their medicare just as it is or they can choose a medicare plan that fits them best just as you as members of congress can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs and starting this year millions of americans will be able to save money tax free for their medical expenses in a health savings account i signed this measure proudly and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors or to take away their prescription drug coverage under medicare will meet my veto on the critical issue of health care our goal is to ensure that americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs to make insurance more affordable congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates so they can cover more workers with health insurance i urge you to pass association health plans i ask you to give lower income americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance by computerizing health records we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes reduce costs and improve care to protect the doctor patient relationship and keep good doctors doing good work we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits and tonight i propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage as part of our new health savings accounts be allowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their taxes a government run health care system is the wrong prescription by keeping costs under control expanding access and helping more americans afford coverage we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes america's health care the best in the world we are living in a time of great change in our world in our economy in science and medicine yet some things endure courage and compassion reverence and integrity respect for differences of faith and race the values we try to live by never change and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions such as families and schools and religious congregations these institutions these unseen pillars of civilization must remain strong in america and we will defend them we must stand with our families to help them raise healthy responsible children when it comes to helping children make right choices there is work for

and fellow citizens: America this evening is a nation called to great responsibilities, and we are rising to meet them.', 'As we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American service men and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror.', 'By bringing hope to the oppressed and delivering justice to the violent, they are making America more secure.', 'Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger lists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are patrolling our coasts and borders.', 'And their vigilance is protecting America.', 'Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world.', 'The American economy is growing stronger.', 'The tax relief you passed is working.', 'Tonight Members of Congress can take pride in the great works of compassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible.', ""You're raising the standards for our public schools, and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under Medicare."", 'We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face a choice: We can go forward with confidence and resolve, or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us.', 'We can press on with economic growth and reforms in education and Medicare, or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions.', ""We've not come all this way, through tragedy and trial and war, only to falter and leave our work unfinished."", 'Americans are rising to the tasks of history, and they expect the same from us.', 'In their efforts, their enterprise, and their character, the American people are showing that the state of our Union is confident and strong.', 'Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people.', 'Twenty-eight months have passed since September the 11th, 2001—over 2 years without an attack on American soil.', 'And it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us.', 'That hope is understandable, comforting— and false.', 'The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombasa, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Baghdad.', 'The terrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world.', 'And by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated.', 'Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us.', 'And one of those essential tools is the PATRIOT Act, which allows Federal law enforcement to better share information to track terrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets.', 'For years, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers.', 'If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting terrorists.', 'Key provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire next year.', 'The terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule.', 'Our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens.', 'You need to renew the PATRIOT Act.', 'America is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war.', 'Last March, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, a mastermind of September the 11th, awoke to find himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani authorities.', 'Last August the 11th brought the capture of the terrorist Hambali, who was a key player in the attack in Indonesia that killed over 200 people.', ""We're tracking Al Qaida around the world, and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed."", 'Thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on the manhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves, and one by one, we will bring these terrorists to justice.', 'As part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists and could supply them with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.', 'The United States and our allies are determined: We refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger.', 'The first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made Afghanistan the primary training base of Al Qaida killers.', 'As of this month, that country has a new constitution guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women.', 'Businesses are opening.', 'Health care centers are being established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan are back in school.', 'With the help from the new Afghan army, our coalition is leading aggressive raids against the surviving members of the Taliban and Al Qaida.', 'The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation that is free and proud and fighting terror, and America is honored to be their friend.', 'Since we last met in this Chamber, combat forces of the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Poland, and other countries enforced the demands of the United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein.', 'And the people of Iraq are free.', ""Having broken the Ba'athist regime, we face a remnant of violent Saddam supporters."", 'Men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows.', 'These killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a serious, continuing danger.', ""Yet we're making progress against them."", 'The once all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole and now sits in a prison cell.', 'Of the top 55 officials of the former regime, we have captured or killed 45.', 'Our forces are on the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day and conducting an average of 180 raids a week.', ""We are dealing with these thugs in Iraq just as surely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein's evil regime."", 'The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right.', 'And America has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right.', ""Last January, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man."", 'Today, our coalition is working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law with a bill of rights.', ""We're working with Iraqis and the United Nations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the end of June."", 'As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear.', 'They are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends, but the United States of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins.', 'The killers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom.', 'Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future.', ""And tonight we are honored to welcome one of Iraq's most respected leaders, the current President of the Iraqi Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi."", 'Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation.', 'Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for the better.', ""Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction programs, including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons."", 'Colonel Qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be better off and far more secure without weapons of mass murder.', 'Nine months of intense negotiations involving the United States and Great Britain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not.', 'And one reason is clear: For diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible, and no one can now doubt the word of America.', 'Different threats require different strategies.', ""Along with nations in the region, we're insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear program."", 'America and the international community are demanding that Iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons.', ""America is committed to keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous regimes."", 'When I came to this rostrum on September the 20th, 2001, I brought the police shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end.', 'I gave to you and to all Americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies.', 'And this pledge, given by one, has been kept by many.', 'You in the Congress have provided the resources for our defense and cast the difficult votes of war and peace.', 'Our closest allies have been unwavering.', ""America's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless."", 'And the men and women of the American military—they have taken the hardest duty.', ""We've seen their skill and their courage in armored charges and midnight raids and lonely hours on faithful watch."", 'We have seen the joy when they return and felt the sorrow when one is lost.', ""I've had the honor of meeting our service men and women at many posts, from the deck of a carrier in the Pacific to a mess hall in Baghdad."", 'Many of our troops are listening tonight, and I want you and your families to know: America is proud of you, and my administration and this Congress will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror.', 'I know that some people question if America is really in a war at all.', 'They view terrorism more as a crime, a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments.', 'After the World Trade Center was first attacked in 1993, some of the guilty were indicted and tried and convicted and sent to prison.', 'But the matter was not settled.', 'The terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations and drawing up more ambitious plans.', 'After the chaos and carnage of September the 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers.', 'The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States, and war is what they got.', 'Some in this Chamber and in our country did not support the liberation of Iraq.', 'Objections to war often come from principled motives, but let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power.', ""We're seeking all the facts."", 'Already, the Kay Report identified dozens of weapons-of-mass-destruction-related program activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations.', ""Had we failed to act, the dictator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day."", 'Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been revealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world.', ""Iraq's torture chambers would still be filled with victims, terrified and innocent."", 'The killing fields of Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of men and women and children vanished into the sands, would still be known only to the killers.', ""For all who love freedom and peace, the world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a better and safer place."", 'Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized.', 'This particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in Britain, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands, Norway, El Salvador, and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to Iraq.', 'As we debate at home, we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners or dismiss their sacrifices.', 'From the beginning, America has sought international support for our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much support.', 'There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few.', 'America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country.', 'We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater Middle East, where freedom is rare.', 'Yet it is mistaken and condescending to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government.', 'I believe that God has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom, and even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades, it will rise again.', 'As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny and despair and anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of America and our friends.', 'So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater Middle East.', 'We will challenge the enemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher standard from our friend.', 'To cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian, and soon a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region.', 'I will send you a proposal to double the budget of the National Endowment for Democracy and to focus its new work on the development of free elections and free markets, free press, and free labor unions in the Middle East.', 'And above all, we will finish the historic work of democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq so those nations can light the way for others and help transform a troubled part of the world.', 'America is a nation with a mission, and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs.', 'We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire.', 'Our aim is a democratic peace, a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman.', 'America acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side, yet we understand our special calling: This great Republic will lead the cause of freedom.', 'In the last 3 years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the American economy.', 'We have come through recession and terrorist attack and corporate scandals and the uncertainties of war.', 'And because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this economy is strong and growing stronger.', 'You have doubled the child tax credit from 500 to $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, and you have lowered taxes for every American who pays income taxes.', 'Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy forward.', 'The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years; new home construction, the highest in almost 20 years; homeowner-ship rates, the highest ever.', 'Manufacturing activity is increasing.', 'Inflation is low.', 'Interest rates are low.', 'Exports are growing.', 'Productivity is high, and jobs are on the rise.', 'These numbers confirm that the American people are using their money far better than Government would have, and you were right to return it.', ""America's growing economy is also a changing economy."", 'As technology transforms the way almost every job is done, America becomes more productive and workers need new skills.', 'Much of our job growth will be found in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology.', 'So we must respond by helping more Americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy.', 'All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools.', 'Yet for too long, for too many children, those skills were never mastered.', 'By passing the No Child Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country.', ""We're providing more funding for our schools, a 36-percent increase since 2001."", ""We're requiring higher standards."", 'We are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals.', 'We are reporting results to parents and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing.', 'We are making progress toward excellence for every child in America.', 'But the status quo always has defenders.', 'Some want to undermine the No Child Left Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability.', ""Yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense: We expect third graders to read and do math at the third grade level, and that's not asking too much."", 'Testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind.', 'This Nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics.', ""I refuse to give up on any child, and the No Child Left Behind Act is opening the door of opportunity to all of America's children."", 'At the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now.', 'Many of the fastest growing occupations require strong math and science preparation and training beyond the high school level.', 'So tonight, I propose a series of measures called Jobs for the 21st Century.', 'This program will provide extra help to middle and high school students who fall behind in reading and math, expand advanced placement programs in low-income schools, invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in our high schools.', 'I propose larger Pell grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school.', ""I propose increasing our support for America's fine community colleges, so they can—I do so, so they can train workers for industries that are creating the most new jobs."", ""By all these actions, we'll help more and more Americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country."", 'Job training is important, and so is job creation.', 'We must continue to pursue an aggressive, progrowth economic agenda.', 'Congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes.', 'The tax reductions you passed are set to expire.', 'Unless you act, the unfair tax on marriage will go back up.', 'Unless you act, millions of families will be charged $300 more in Federal taxes for every child.', 'Unless you act, small businesses will pay higher taxes.', 'Unless you act, the death tax will eventually come back to life.', 'Unless you act, Americans face a tax increase.', 'What Congress has given, the Congress should not take away.', 'For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed should be permanent.', 'Our agenda for jobs and growth must help small-business owners and employees with relief from needless Federal regulation and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits.', 'Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run, so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote conservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy.', ""My administration is promoting free and fair trade to open up new markets for America's entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers, to create jobs for American workers."", 'Younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirement account.', 'We should make the Social Security system a source of ownership for the American people.', ""And we should limit the burden of Government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayers' dollars."", 'In 2 weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets important domestic needs while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 percent.', ""This will require that Congress focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's money."", 'By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years.', 'Tonight I also ask you to reform our immigration laws so they reflect our values and benefit our economy.', 'I propose a new temporary-worker program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers when no Americans can be found to fill the job.', 'This reform will be good for our economy because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system.', 'A temporary-worker program will help protect our homeland, allowing Border Patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security.', 'I oppose amnesty, because it would encourage further illegal immigration and unfairly reward those who break our laws.', 'My temporary-worker program will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law while bringing millions of hard-working men and women out from the shadows of American life.', ""Our Nation's health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of change."", 'Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives.', 'This dramatic progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance.', 'Members of Congress, we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country.', 'Meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort, and 2 months ago, you showed the way.', 'By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit, you kept a basic commitment to our seniors.', 'You are giving them the modern medicine they deserve.', 'Starting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs, and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional $600 to buy medicine.', 'Beginning next year, seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease, and seniors just entering Medicare can receive wellness exams.', 'In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare.', 'For a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half.', 'Under this reform, senior citizens will be able to keep their Medicare just as it is, or they can choose a Medicare plan that fits them best, just as you, as Members of Congress, can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs.', 'And starting this year, millions of Americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical expenses in a health savings account.', 'I signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors or to take away their prescription drug coverage under Medicare will meet my veto.', 'On the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that Americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs.', 'To make insurance more affordable, Congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs.', 'Small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates, so they can cover more workers with health insurance.', 'I urge you to pass association health plans.', 'I ask you to give lower income Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance.', 'By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs, and improve care.', 'To protect the doctor-patient relationship and keep good doctors doing good work, we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits.', 'And tonight I propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage as part of our new health savings accounts be allowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their taxes.', 'A Government-run health care system is the wrong prescription.', ""By keeping costs under control, expanding access, and helping more Americans afford coverage, we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes America's health care the best in the world."", 'We are living in a time of great change in our world, in our economy, in science and medicine.', 'Yet some things endure: courage and compassion, reverence and integrity, respect for differences of faith and race.', 'The values we try to live by never change, and they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions such as families and schools and religious congregations.', 'These institutions, these unseen pillars of civilization, must remain strong in America, and we will defend them.', 'We must stand with our families to help them raise healthy, responsible children.', 'When it comes to helping children make right choices, there is work for all of us to do.', 'One of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and futures on drugs.', 'Our Government is helping parents confront this problem with aggressive education, treatment, and law enforcement.', 'Drug use in high school has declined by 11 percent over the last 2 years.', 'Four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001.', 'In my budget, I propose new funding to continue our aggressive, community-based strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs.', 'Drug testing in our schools has proven to be an effective part of this effort.', ""So tonight I propose an additional 23 million for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children's lives."", 'The aim here is not to punish children but to send them this message: We love you, and we do not want to lose you.', 'To help children make right choices, they need good examples.', 'Athletics play such an important role in our society, but unfortunately, some in professional sports are not setting much of an example.', 'The use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball, football, and other sports is dangerous, and it sends the wrong message, that there are shortcuts to accomplishment and that performance is more important than character.', 'So tonight I call on team owners, union representatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the right signal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now.', ""To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face, even when they're difficult to talk about."", 'Each year, about 3 million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them or kill them or prevent them from ever becoming parents.', 'In my budget, I propose a grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks.', 'We will double Federal funding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact of life: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.', 'Decisions children now make can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives.', 'All of us, parents and schools and government, must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture and to send the right messages to our children.', 'A strong America must also value the institution of marriage.', 'I believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization.', 'Congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton.', 'That statute protects marriage under Federal law as a union of a man and a woman and declares that one State may not redefine marriage for other States.', 'Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives.', ""On an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard."", 'If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process.', 'Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.', 'The outcome of this debate is important, and so is the way we conduct it.', ""The same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in God's sight."", ""It's also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion of America's religious institutions."", 'Religious charities of every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country: mentoring children, feeding the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely.', 'Yet Government has often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups, just because they have a cross or a Star of David or a crescent on the wall.', 'By Executive order, I have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based charities.', 'Tonight I ask you to codify this into law, so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again.', ""In the past, we've worked together to bring mentors to children of prisoners and provide treatment for the addicted and help for the homeless."", 'Tonight I ask you to consider another group of Americans in need of help.', 'This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society.', ""We know from long experience that if they can't find work or a home or help, they are much more likely to commit crime and return to prison."", 'So tonight I propose a 4-year, $300 million prisoner reentry initiative to expand job training and placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups.', 'America is the land of second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.', 'For all Americans, the last 3 years have brought tests we did not ask for and achievements shared by all.', 'By our actions, we have shown what kind of nation we are.', 'In grief, we have found the grace to go on.', 'In challenge, we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people.', 'In victory, we have shown the noble aims and good heart of America.', 'And having come this far, we sense that we live in a time set apart.', ""I've been witness to the character of the people of America, who have shown calm in times of danger, compassion for one another, and toughness for the long haul."", 'All of us have been partners in a great enterprise.', 'And even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic times.', 'Last month a girl in Lincoln, Rhode Island, sent me a letter.', 'It began, ""Dear George W. Bush.', 'If there\'s anything you know I, Ashley Pearson, age 10, can do to help anyone, please send me a letter and tell me what I can do to save our country.""', 'She added this P.S.', ': ""If you can send a letter to the troops, please put, \'Ashley Pearson believes in you.""\'', 'Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops has just been conveyed.', 'And yes, you have some duties yourself: Study hard in school; listen to your mom or dad; help someone in need; and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform, say, ""Thank you.""', 'And Ashley, while you do your part, all of us here in this great Chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of America safe and free.', 'My fellow citizens, we now move forward with confidence and faith.', 'Our Nation is strong and steadfast.', 'The cause we serve is right, because it is the cause of all mankind.', 'The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable, and it is not carried forward by our power alone.', 'We can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years.', 'And in all that is to come, we can know that His purposes are just and true.', 'May God continue to bless America.']","['Mr.',

"Today's unanimous vote by the United Nations Security Council adopting Resolution 1483 to lift sanctions on Iraq will help the Iraqi people to rebuild their country and work toward a more prosperous and secure future, one in which they will govern themselves, rejoin the world economy, and remain at peace with their neighbors. The nations of the world have demonstrated their unity in their commitment to help the Iraqi people on their path toward a better future. The Security Council's resolution affirms that the United Nations will have an appropriate vital role in Iraq's reconstruction and transition to a new government. It establishes a strong and important framework for many nations to participate in these activities. I look forward to the Secretary-General's appointment of a Special Representative as we work together to help Iraq recover from three decades of brutal dictatorship. I also look forward to the establishment of an Iraqi Interim Administration that is broadbased and represents all of Iraq's people so that Iraqis can participate as quickly and as fully as possible in the revitalization of their country. The United States and its coalition partners will remain in Iraq as long as necessary to help put Iraq on the path toward democracy, with a united, representative government that respects human rights and the rule of law.

"Congressional Blunder On Farm Bill Presents Opportunity To Go Back To The Drawing Board ""The President vetoed the bill that the Democrats sent us. ... I understand there's a technical error and we'll have to see what the Congress decides to do, but maybe it gives them one more chance to take a look and think about how much they're asking the taxpayers to spend at a time of record farm income. The Congress had an opportunity to ... implement reforms, much needed reforms, and they decided not to. And I think with this move it shows that they can even ... screw up spending the taxpayers' money unwisely.""  – White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, 5/22/08  For a year and a half, the Administration has consistently asked that the Congress pass a good farm bill that is fiscally responsible and better targets support programs. The Congress is now preparing to reconsider at least a portion of the farm bill and should take this opportunity to address the objections that have been raised repeatedly and the most recently raised concerns related to the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program.  The current agreement increases spending by more than $20 billion and fails to include much-needed farm program reforms proposed by President Bush. Congress is now continuing its gimmicks by delaying the budget resolution until after it again passes at least part of the farm bill in order to hide $3 billion in farm bill spending that Congress hasn't counted. This bill also adds a number of unrelated provisions and others never considered by the full Congress, such as numerous trade-related provisions. This bill is inconsistent with our objectives in international trade negotiations, which include increasing market access for American farmers and ranchers. Congress should reconsider this extraneous spending increase.   This legislation is also filled with earmarks and other ill-considered provisions. Most notably, the current agreement includes: $175 million to address water issues for desert lakes; $250 million for a 400,000-acre land purchase from a private owner; funding and authority for the noncompetitive sale of National Forest land to a ski resort; and $382 million earmarked for a specific watershed. Rural and urban Americans alike are frustrated with excessive government spending and the funneling of taxpayer funds for pet projects. Congress should seize the opportunity to eliminate wasteful spending.   Congress should improve the farm bill or extend the current bill for at least one year. President Bush last week made clear that this is not the time to ask American families who are already paying more in the check-out line to pay more in subsidies to support a record-setting farm economy. We celebrate the fact that our agriculture economy is doing well, but this is not the time to further increase subsidy rates while failing to target payments to farmers who need them. This bill jeopardizes America's support for farm programs.  Congress' Farm Bill Lacks Program Reform And Fiscal Discipline At a time when net farm income is projected to increase by more than $28 billion in one year, Congress should not increase farm subsidies and add to the subsidy rolls. The farm bill fails to adequately reform payment limitations and instead allows for excessively high limits on the level of allowable income for receiving farm subsidies. Net farm income is forecast to be 51 percent above its 10-year average. The Administration originally proposed to lower to $200,000 the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limit for receiving farm program subsidies. Congress wants to allow subsidies to continue for farmers with AGI of up to $1.5 million. Following passage of this legislation, it has become clear that a newly designed subsidy program, which is uncapped, could result in billions of dollars being made available to subsidize crops, locking in historically high price levels. The amount of the subsidy is tied to recent record prices. If prices drop even 10 percent from these levels, the new program could increase taxpayer-financed payments to farmers by billions of dollars, despite still profitable crop prices. This provision is grossly inconsistent with the Administration's proposals for reform of subsidy payments. The farm bill will make it harder to get adequate food aid to hungry people by essentially locking-in aid dollars for non-emergency use. The bill also fails to include the Administration's proposal to add flexibility by allowing up to a quarter of the purchases by our largest food aid program to be made near crisis areas. This would allow us to provide more assistance faster and more efficiently. The current agreement fails to deliver conservation results, cutting protection for new wetland acres by 36 percent compared to the 2002 Farm Bill, and eliminating seven million acres from protection under the conservation reserve program. The bill fails to adequately protect vanishing native grasslands, making such protections optional for only a few states.

reconsider at least a portion of the farm bill and should take this opportunity to address the objections that have been raised repeatedly and the most recently raised concerns related to the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program.', 'The current agreement increases spending by more than $20 billion and fails to include much-needed farm program reforms proposed by President Bush.', ""Congress is now continuing its gimmicks by delaying the budget resolution until after it again passes at least part of the farm bill in order to hide $3 billion in farm bill spending that Congress hasn't counted."", 'This bill also adds a number of unrelated provisions and others never considered by the full Congress, such as numerous trade-related provisions.', 'This bill is inconsistent with our objectives in international trade negotiations, which include increasing market access for American farmers and ranchers.', 'Congress should reconsider this extraneous spending increase.', 'This legislation is also filled with earmarks and other ill-considered provisions.', 'Most notably, the current agreement includes: $175 million to address water issues for desert lakes; $250 million for a 400,000-acre land purchase from a private owner; funding and authority for the noncompetitive sale of National Forest land to a ski resort; and $382 million earmarked for a specific watershed.', 'Rural and urban Americans alike are frustrated with excessive government spending and the funneling of taxpayer funds for pet projects.', 'Congress should seize the opportunity to eliminate wasteful spending.', 'Congress should improve the farm bill or extend the current bill for at least one year.', 'President Bush last week made clear that this is not the time to ask American families who are already paying more in the check-out line to pay more in subsidies to support a record-setting farm economy.', 'We celebrate the fact that our agriculture economy is doing well, but this is not the time to further increase subsidy rates while failing to target payments to farmers who need them.', ""This bill jeopardizes America's support for farm programs."", ""Congress' Farm Bill Lacks Program Reform And Fiscal Discipline At a time when net farm income is projected to increase by more than $28 billion in one year, Congress should not increase farm subsidies and add to the subsidy rolls."", 'The farm bill fails to adequately reform payment limitations and instead allows for excessively high limits on the level of allowable income for receiving farm subsidies.', 'Net farm income is forecast to be 51 percent above its 10-year average.', 'The Administration originally proposed to lower to $200,000 the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limit for receiving farm program subsidies.', 'Congress wants to allow subsidies to continue for farmers with AGI of up to $1.5 million.', 'Following passage of this legislation, it has become clear that a newly designed subsidy program, which is uncapped, could result in billions of dollars being made available to subsidize crops, locking in historically high price levels.', 'The amount of the subsidy is tied to recent record prices.', 'If prices drop even 10 percent from these levels, the new program could increase taxpayer-financed payments to farmers by billions of dollars, despite still profitable crop prices.', ""This provision is grossly inconsistent with the Administration's proposals for reform of subsidy payments."", 'The farm bill will make it harder to get adequate food aid to hungry people by essentially locking-in aid dollars for non-emergency use.', ""The bill also fails to include the Administration's proposal to add flexibility by allowing up to a quarter of the purchases by our largest food aid program to be made near crisis areas."", 'This would allow us to provide more assistance faster and more efficiently.', 'The current agreement fails to deliver conservation results, cutting protection for new wetland acres by 36 percent compared to the 2002 Farm Bill, and eliminating seven million acres from protection under the conservation reserve program.', 'The bill fails to adequately protect vanishing native grasslands, making such protections optional for only a few states.']","['Congressional', 'Blunder', 'On', 'Farm', 'Bill', 'Presents', 'Opportunity', 'To', 'Go', 'Back', 'To', 'The',

"To the House of Representatives: I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 810, the ""Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005."" Like all Americans, I believe our Nation must vigorously pursue the tremendous possibilities that science offers to cure disease and improve the lives of millions. Yet, as science brings us ever closer to unlocking the secrets of human biology, it also offers temptations to manipulate human life and violate human dignity. Our conscience and history as a Nation demand that we resist this temptation. With the right scientific techniques and the right policies, we can achieve scientific progress while living up to our ethical responsibilities. In 2001, I set forth a new policy on stem cell research that struck a balance between the needs of science and the demands of conscience. When I took office, there was no Federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. Under the policy I announced 5 years ago, my Administration became the first to make Federal funds available for this research, but only on embryonic stem cell lines derived from embryos that had already been destroyed. My Administration has made available more than $90 million for research of these lines. This policy has allowed important research to go forward and has allowed America to continue to lead the world in embryonic stem cell research without encouraging the further destruction of living human embryos. H.R. 810 would overturn my Administration's balanced policy on embryonic stem cell research. If this bill were to become law, American taxpayers for the first time in our history would be compelled to fund the deliberate destruction of human embryos. Crossing this line would be a grave mistake and would needlessly encourage a conflict between science and ethics that can only do damage to both and harm our Nation as a whole. Advances in research show that stem cell science can progress in an ethical way. Since I announced my policy in 2001, my Administration has expanded funding of research into stem cells that can be drawn from children, adults, and the blood in umbilical cords with no harm to the donor, and these stem cells are currently being used in medical treatments. Science also offers the hope that we may one day enjoy the potential benefits of embryonic stem cells without destroying human life. Researchers are investigating new techniques that might allow doctors and scientists to produce stem cells just as versatile as those derived from human embryos without harming life. We must continue to explore these hopeful alternatives, so we can advance the cause of scientific research while staying true to the ideals of a decent and humane society. I hold to the principle that we can harness the promise of technology without becoming slaves to technology and ensure that science serves the cause of humanity. If we are to find the right ways to advance ethical medical research, we must also be willing when necessary to reject the wrong ways. For that reason, I must veto this bill. GEORGE W.

"Thank you all so much for that warm welcome. And I also want to thank the hundreds of our fellow Americans who lined the road coming in from the helicopter pad. It's really good to be here in California to report on our progress in the struggle against terror. Now, there's the long version, and there's a short version. So I'm going to start with the short version: Our people are united; our Government is determined; our cause is right; and justice will be done. I want to thank Gerry Parsky. I want to thank all the folks who put on this— organized this event. I appreciate so much the Governor, Gray Davis, coming, and all the elected officials. I particularly want to say hello to the members of the Sacramento Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 7. They may not remember, but I do—I got to meet them in New York City.  They were part of an incredible outpouring of compassion and support from all across the country. I've got to tell you, I was amazed when I went into the building, and they said they were from California. I said, ""This country is fabulous, when we've got people from California, from Sacramento, going all the way over to help their brothers and sisters at the World Trade Center."" And I know you're just as proud of them as I am, and thank you all for being here. This great State is known for its diversity, people of all races, all religions, and all nationalities. They've come here to live a better life, to find freedom, to live in peace and security, with tolerance and with justice. When the terrorists attacked America, this is what they attacked. And when we defend America, this is what we defend. We are fighting for the security of our people, for the success of our ideals, and for stability in large parts of the world. We fight evil people who are distorting and betraying a great religion to justify their murder. Our cause is just. We will not tire. We will not falter, and my fellow Americans, we will not fail. New York City and Washington, DC, are 2,500 miles from here. Yet, for all of us, an American is an American, no matter where we live, no matter what our race, no matter how we pray. The people of New York and Washington are our neighbors, and when terrorists attack them, they attack us all. And the terrorists are hearing from us all. They are hearing from a compassionate nation, a nation that sends food and medicine to starving people of Afghanistan, a nation whose children—and I know we've got some here who have raised money at the elementary school—whose children are sending their dollars to save the children of Afghanistan. They are hearing from a tolerant nation, a nation that respects Islam and values our many Muslim citizens. They are hearing from a prayerful nation, a nation that prays to an almighty God for protection and for peace. And they are hearing from a patient and determined nation, a nation that will continue this war for as long as it takes to win. Ours will be a broad campaign fought on many fronts. It's a campaign that will be waged by day and by night, in the light and in the shadow, in battles you will see and battles you won't see. It's a campaign waged by soldiers and sailors, marines and airmen, and also by FBI agents and law enforcement officials and diplomats and intelligence officers. It's a campaign that is being waged in distant lands and a campaign being waged by our new Office of Homeland Security. To keep us safe, we're working around the clock. We're on the lookout. We have questioned and detained more than 750 terror suspects and material witnesses in our country. And the broad coalition we put together has detained hundreds of suspected members of the Al Qaida organization. Our world coalition is working. We are taking apart the terrorist network, piece by piece. We're taking away their money by freezing their assets and choking off their incomes. Our campaign will be difficult, and it's going to take time. But I can promise you this: It will be waged with determination, and it will be waged until we win. We will do whatever it takes to protect our country, protect the good American families. And we will do whatever it takes to punish those who have attacked us. We'll do whatever it takes to defeat terror abroad, wherever it grows or wherever it hides. In Afghanistan, our Armed Forces are performing their duty with skill and success. We've destroyed many terrorist camps. We've damaged the Taliban's air defenses. We've seriously weakened all those in Afghanistan who wish to inflict harm on people anywhere in the world. We're paving the way for friendly troops to defeat the Taliban and root out the Al Qaida parasites that the Taliban hosts and protects. We're enforcing the doctrine that says this: If you harbor the terrorists, you are guilty of terror, and like the terrorists, you will be held responsible. We are not alone in this struggle. The war against terrorism is an international war, and we're fighting with a broad, broad coalition. Many nations around the world have joined with us in this cause, including nations from the Islamic world. Some countries contribute intelligence. Some help with law enforcement. Some join with military power, like our friends Great Britain. We are supported by the conscience of the world. And we are surrounding terrorists and their sponsors in a tightening net of justice. Later today I fly to Shanghai to meet with leaders from all round the Far East and leaders whose nations touch the Pacific, including Russia and China. We'll be strengthening our cooperation in the war on terror. We'll strengthen the economic ties that bring growth and hope to the entire world. The terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, and we will defeat them by expanding and encouraging world trade. In order to help me expand world trade, I've asked the Congress to give me what's called trade promotion authority, the ability to seek America's interests around the world. America will do whatever it takes to strengthen our security here at home. I've named former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge to head the new Office of Homeland Security, to help expose and to frustrate the plans of terrorists. We've adopted new measures to protect our airlines, so Americans can fly with greater confidence. We're responding rapidly to investigate anthrax reports and to quickly give preventative treatment to any who are exposed. Thousands of FBI agents are aggressively following every lead in our antiterror campaign. And I urge Congress to act quickly to update our laws and procedures so we can better protect our country and punish those who threaten us. The terrorists want us to stop our lives— that's what they want. They want us to stop flying, and they want us to stop buying. But this great Nation will not be intimidated by the evildoers. America will do whatever it takes to get our economy moving again. These are difficult times. Too many Americans are hurting. Too many are worried about their jobs and their businesses. And I know that California has been hit especially hard. America has got great resources, though. We've got the most skilled workers in the world, the best workforce. Taxpayers have just received their rebates. Interest rates have been cut to the lowest level in years. Energy prices are declining. The entrepreneurial spirit has never been stronger in America. The basics of our economy are ripe for growth. Yet, recent events have been a shock— no question about it—have shocked our economy. And people need help. And the Government in Washington is actively responding. We've already announced additional spending to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, to stabilize our airline industry, and to make sure we have enough money to defend our country. And I'll work with Congress to help workers who have lost their jobs because of the sudden economic slowdown. I've outlined additional economic stimulus package. I've listened carefully to members from both political parties. It's a package that will provide a needed lift for our economy. I urge Congress to act now to accelerate the tax relief we've already planned for the years ahead, so consumers will have more money to spend. I urge Congress to have more tax relief for lower- and moderate-income families in America who are especially hard hit. And I urge Congress to reform the corporate income tax, and as well, allow businesses to deduct more of the costs of new investments immediately, so as to create jobs for American people. And I ask Congress to now act on an energy bill that the House of Representatives passed back in August. This is an issue of special importance to California. Too much of our energy comes from the Middle East. The plan I sent up to Congress promotes conservation, expands energy supplies, and improves the efficiency of our energy network. Our country needs greater energy independence. This issue is a matter of national security, and I hope the Senate acts quickly. On all these great issues, there's a spirit of respect and cooperation in Washington, I'm pleased to report.  This morning I had breakfast with the four leaders of the Congress. And while we have our differences, I do want you to know, there is a strong determination to do what's right for the American people. I have butted heads in the past——with the leadership. But I want you to know, I applaud their love for America and their determination—their determination—to get the people's business done in a way that will make you proud. We're making good progress about changing the tone. The terrorists thought they affected us, but they've only made this Nation stronger. Not only do I applaud the leadership; I applaud the American people for your courage in a time of trial. We're living through a unique moment in American history. This is a time of rediscovery, of heroism and sacrifice and duty and patriotism. These are core values of our country, and they're being renewed. We found them waiting for us just when we needed them. Our forefathers would be proud, really proud of what they see in America today. They would be proud of the selfless duty of the firefighters and police officers of New York, firefighters and police officers all around our country, and the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America. Our forefathers would salute the modern-day sacrifice of the brave passengers on Flight 93, who, after reciting the Lord's Prayer, said, ""Let's roll,"" and stormed the hijackers, taking the plane down and probably saving thousands of lives on the ground. Our forefathers would know and recognize the spirit of unity and patriotism everywhere in our country, and they would say, ""Well done, America."" No, the true character of this great land has been revealed in adversity. Americans are generous to our neighbors in need. Americans are tolerant toward our fellow citizens of every background. Americans are alert to danger but calm and determined in the work ahead. And Americans are reaching out across the world to say: We wage a war on the guilty, not the innocent; we're friends to people of all faiths and enemies only to those who choose to make enemies of us. And Americans know we must act now. We must be strong, and we must be decisive. We must stop the evil ones, so our children and grandchildren can know peace and security and freedom in the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. Our Nation has felt great sorrow. Yet, this can be a time of great achievement. A great evil can be turned to greater good. The terrorists did not intend to create a new American spirit of unity and resolve, but they are powerless to stop it. At my Inaugural, I said that some Americans feel as if they share a continent but not a country. We don't feel that any longer. We know we're one people. We know we're one country. We're united from coast to coast by a determination and a firm resolve to see that right prevails. I will take that determination with me to meet leaders of the world in Shanghai. And America will take that determination all the way to victory. Thank you for having me. God bless. Thank you all.

"Colin Powell is one of the great public servants of our time. He is a soldier, a diplomat, a civic leader, a statesman, and a great patriot. I value his friendship. He will be missed. On behalf of all Americans, I thank him for his many years of service, and I wish him and Alma all the best. In his 4 years as Secretary of State, Colin forged new alliances that are helping America win the war on terror and reinvigorated old and honored friendships. He has helped to build two great coalitions that have liberated more than 50 million people in Afghanistan and Iraq from brutal dictators and which are now helping those nations emerge as successful democracies. He was a key architect of the Broader Middle East Initiative, which is helping to spread freedom and democracy in that region. His diplomatic skills also helped to end regional conflicts and lower tensions on the Indian subcontinent. Through his advocacy, he focused the world's attention on the plight of the suffering in Sudan, Liberia, and Haiti. His role in resolving the EP- 3 incident early in my administration showed the calm judgment and steady resolve he has brought to our foreign policy.

"Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we gather tonight, our Nation is at war; our economy is in recession; and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet, the state of our Union has never been stronger. We last met in an hour of shock and suffering. In 4 short months, our Nation has comforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rallied a great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan's terrorist training camps, saved a people from starvation, and freed a country from brutal oppression. The American flag flies again over our Embassy in Kabul. Terrorists who once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. And terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own. America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror. We'll be partners in rebuilding that country. And this evening we welcomed the distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan, Chairman Hamid Karzai. The last time we met in this Chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school. Today, women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new Government. And we welcome the new Minister of Women's Affairs, Dr. Sima Samar. Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United States military. When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill. And tonight, thanks to them, we are winning the war on terror. The men and women of our Armed Forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the United States: Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans and continents, on mountaintops and in caves, you will not escape the justice of this Nation. For many Americans, these 4 months have brought sorrow and pain that will never completely go away. Every day a retired firefighter returns to Ground Zero to feel closer to his two sons who died there. At a memorial in New York, a little boy left his football with a note for his lost father: ""Dear Daddy, please take this to heaven. I don't want to play football until I can play with you again some day."" Last month, at the grave of her husband, Micheal, a CIA officer and marine who died in Mazar-e-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of farewell, ""Semper Fi, my love."" Shannon is with us tonight. Shannon, I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause is just, and our country will never forget the debt we owe Micheal and all who gave their lives for freedom. Our cause is just, and it continues. Our discoveries in Afghanistan confirmed our worst fears and showed us the true scope of the task ahead. We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in videos where they laugh about the loss of innocent life. And the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design. We have found diagrams of American nuclear powerplants and public water facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons, surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout the world. What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there, our war against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's camps, and so were tens of thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking timebombs, set to go off without warning. Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners, hundreds of terrorists have been arrested. Yet, tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large. These enemies view the entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they are. So long as training camps operate, so long as nations harbor terrorists, freedom is at risk. And America and our allies must not and will not allow it. Our Nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives. First, we will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice. And second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world. Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries. A terrorist underworld, including groups like Hamas, Hizballah, Islamic Jihad, Jaish-e-Mohammed, operates in remote jungles and deserts and hides in the centers of large cities. While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is acting elsewhere. We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to train that country's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an American and still hold hostages. Our soldiers, working with the Bosnian Government, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our Embassy. Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia. My hope is that all nations will heed our call and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own. Many nations are acting forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf. But some governments will be timid in the face of terror. And make no mistake about it: If they do not act, America will. Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th, but we know their true nature. North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens. Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom. Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world. States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic. We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction. We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from sudden attack. And all nations should know: America will do what is necessary to ensure our Nation's security. We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side. I will not wait on events while dangers gather. I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer. The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons. Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun. This campaign may not be finished on our watch; yet, it must be and it will be waged on our watch. We can't stop short. If we stop now, leaving terror camps intact and terrorist states unchecked, our sense of security would be false and temporary. History has called America and our allies to action, and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight. Our first priority must always be the security of our Nation, and that will be reflected in the budget I send to Congress. My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy. September the 11th brought out the best in America and the best in this Congress. And I join the American people in applauding your unity and resolve. Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home. I'm a proud member of my party. Yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and create jobs in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republicans, not as Democrats but as Americans. It costs a lot to fight this war. We have spent more than a billion dollars a month, over $30 million a day, and we must be prepared for future operations. Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we need more of them. We need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely. Our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons, the best equipment, the best training, and they also deserve another pay raise. My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades, because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too high. Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay. The next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect our citizens and strengthen our Nation against the ongoing threat of another attack. Time and distance from the events of September the 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons. America is no longer protected by vast oceans. We are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad and increased vigilance at home. My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border security, and improved intelligence. We will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases. We'll increase funding to help States and communities train and equip our heroic police and firefighters. We will improve intelligence collection and sharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the security of air travel, and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of visitors to the United States. Homeland security will make America not only stronger but, in many ways, better. Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health. Stronger police and fire departments will mean safer neighborhoods. Stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal drugs. And as government works to better secure our homeland, America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens. A few days before Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger lighting a match. The crew and passengers quickly subdued the man, who had been trained by Al Qaida and was armed with explosives. The people on that plane were alert and, as a result, likely saved nearly 200 lives. And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants Hermis Moutardier and Christina Jones. Once we have funded our national security and our homeland security, the final great priority of my budget is economic security for the American people. To achieve these great national objectives—to win the war, protect the homeland, and revitalize our economy—our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short term, so long as Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible manner. We have clear priorities, and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas. We'll prevail in the war, and we will defeat this recession. Americans who have lost their jobs need our help, and I support extending unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage. Yet, American workers want more than unemployment checks; they want a steady paycheck. When America works, America prospers, so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word: jobs. Good jobs begin with good schools, and here we've made a fine start. Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind. I was proud to work with members of both parties: Chairman John Boehner and Congressman George Miller; Senator Judd Gregg. And I was so proud of our work, I even had nice things to say about my friend Ted Kennedy.  I know the folks at the Crawford coffee shop couldn't believe I'd say such a thing— —but our work on this bill shows what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on results. There is more to do. We need to prepare our children to read and succeed in school with improved Head Start and early childhood development programs. We must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for America, a quality teacher in every classroom. Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy. This Congress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil. Good jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into new markets creates new jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority. On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of Representatives has acted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation. Good jobs depend on sound tax policy. Last year, some in this Hall thought my tax relief plan was too small; some thought it was too big. But when the checks arrived in the mail, most Americans thought tax relief was just about right. Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling the child credit, and ending the death tax. For the sake of long-term growth and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax cuts permanent. The way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend. For the sake of American workers, let's pass a stimulus package. Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform. As we reauthorize these important reforms, we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job. Americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health security. I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patients' bill of rights, to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage, to approve an historic increase in the spending for veterans' health, and to give seniors a sound and modern Medicare system that includes coverage for prescription drugs. A good job should lead to security in retirement. I ask Congress to enact new safeguards for 401(k) and pension plans. Employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company fails. Through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements, corporate America must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct. Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of Social Security, and we will. We must make Social Security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them. Members, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other issues: productive farm policy; a cleaner environment; broader homeownership, especially among minorities; and ways to encourage the good work of charities and faith-based groups. I ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we've applied to our war against terrorism. During these last few months, I've been humbled and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of testing. Our enemies believed America was weak and
 materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil. The American people have responded magnificently, with courage and compassion, strength and resolve. As I have met the heroes, hugged the families, and looked into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in awe of the American people. And I hope you will join me—I hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one American for the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our Nation in crisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush. None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September the 11th. Yet, after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves. We were reminded that we are citizens with obligations to each other, to our country, and to history. We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate and more about the good we can do. For too long our culture has said, ""If it feels good, do it."" Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed, ""Let's roll."" In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like. We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self. We've been offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass. My call tonight is for every American to commit at least 2 years, 4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime, to the service of your neighbors and your Nation. Many are already serving, and I thank you. If you aren't sure how to help, I've got a good place to start. To sustain and extend the best that has emerged in America, I invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps. The Freedom Corps will focus on three areas of need: responding in case of crisis at home; rebuilding our communities; and extending American compassion throughout the world. One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security. America needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major emergencies, volunteers to help police and fire departments, transportation and utility workers well-trained in spotting danger. Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities. We need mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in prison. And we need more talented teachers in troubled schools. USA Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers. And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world. So we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps, double its volunteers over the next 5 years, and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the Islamic world. This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity, a moment we must seize to change our culture. Through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I know we can overcome evil with greater good. And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace. All fathers and mothers, in all societies, want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and violence. No people on Earth yearn to be oppressed or aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police. If anyone doubts this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic ""street"" greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration. Let the skeptics look to Islam's own rich history, with its centuries of learning and tolerance and progress. America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere. No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. We have no intention of imposing our culture. But America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance. America will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values around the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment. We seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror. In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries. America is working with Russia and China and India, in ways we have never before, to achieve peace and prosperity. In every region, free markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift lives. Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia and Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of terror cannot stop the momentum of freedom. The last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would return to normal. In some ways, it has. In others, it never will. Those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by them. We've come to know truths that we will never question: Evil is real, and it must be opposed. Beyond all differences of race or creed, we are one country, mourning together and facing danger together. Deep in the American character, there is honor, and it is stronger than cynicism. And many have discovered again that even in tragedy—especially in tragedy— God is near. In a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty, that we've been called to a unique role in human events. Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential. Our enemies send other people's children on missions of suicide and murder. They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed. We stand for a different choice, made long ago on the day of our founding. We affirm it again today. We choose freedom and the dignity of every life. Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We have known freedom's price. We have shown freedom's power. And in this great conflict, my fellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory. Thank you all. May God bless.

must act to increase energy production at home so america is less dependent on foreign oil good jobs depend on expanded trade selling into new markets creates new jobs so i ask congress to finally approve trade promotion authority on these two key issues trade and energy the house of representatives has acted to create jobs and i urge the senate to pass this legislation good jobs depend on sound tax policy last year some in this hall thought my tax relief plan was too small some thought it was too big but when the checks arrived in the mail most americans thought tax relief was just about right congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates doubling the child credit and ending the death tax for the sake of long term growth and to help americans plan for the future let's make these tax cuts permanent the way out of this recession the way to create jobs is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend for the sake of american workers let's pass a stimulus package good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform as we reauthorize these important reforms we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government and offer every american the dignity of a job americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health security i ask congress to join me this year to enact a patients' bill of rights to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage to approve an historic increase in the spending for veterans' health and to give seniors a sound and modern medicare system that includes coverage for prescription drugs a good job should lead to security in retirement i ask congress to enact new safeguards for 401 k and pension plans employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company fails through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements corporate america must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of social security and we will we must make social security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them members you and i will work together in the months ahead on other issues productive farm policy a cleaner environment broader homeownership especially among minorities and ways to encourage the good work of charities and faith based groups i ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we've applied to our war against terrorism during these last few months i've been humbled and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of testing our enemies believed america was weak and materialistic that we would splinter in fear and selfishness they were as wrong as they are evil the american people have responded magnificently with courage and compassion strength and resolve as i have met the heroes hugged the families and looked into the tired faces of rescuers i have stood in awe of the american people and i hope you will join me'i hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one american for the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our nation in crisis our first lady laura bush none of us would ever wish the evil that was done on september the 11th yet after america was attacked it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves we were reminded that we are citizens with obligations to each other to our country and to history we began to think less of the goods we can accumulate and more about the good we can do for too long our culture has said if it feels good do it now america is embracing a new ethic and a new creed let's roll in the sacrifice of soldiers the fierce brotherhood of firefighters and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like we want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self we've been offered a unique opportunity and we must not let this moment pass my call tonight is for every american to commit at least 2 years 4 000 hours over the rest of your lifetime to the service of your neighbors and your nation many are already serving and i thank you if you aren't sure how to help i've got a good place to start to sustain and extend the best that has emerged in america i invite you to join the new usa freedom corps the freedom corps will focus on three areas of need responding in case of crisis at home rebuilding our communities and extending american compassion throughout the world one purpose of the usa freedom corps will be homeland security america needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major emergencies volunteers to help police and fire departments transportation and utility workers well trained in spotting danger our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities we need mentors to love children especially children whose parents are in prison and we need more talented teachers in troubled schools usa freedom corps will expand and improve the good efforts of americorps and senior corps to recruit more than 200 000 new volunteers and america needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world so we will renew the promise of the peace corps double its volunteers over the next 5 years and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the islamic world this time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity a moment we must seize to change our culture through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness i know we can overcome evil with greater good and we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace all fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppressed or aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police if anyone doubts this let them look to afghanistan where the islamic street greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration let the skeptics look to islam's own rich history with its centuries of learning and tolerance and progress america will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere no nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them we have no intention of imposing our culture but america will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the power of the state respect for women private property free speech equal justice and religious tolerance america will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values around the world including the islamic world because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment we seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror in this moment of opportunity a common danger is erasing old rivalries america is working with russia and china and india in ways we have never before to achieve peace and prosperity in every region free markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift lives together with friends and allies from europe to asia and africa to latin america we will demonstrate that the forces of terror cannot stop the momentum of freedom the last time i spoke here i expressed the hope that life would return to normal in some ways it has in others it never will those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by them we've come to know truths that we will never question evil is real and it must be opposed beyond all differences of race or creed we are one country mourning together and facing danger together deep in the american character there is honor and it is stronger than cynicism and many have discovered again that even in tragedy'especially in tragedy'god is near in a single instant we realized that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty that we've been called to a unique role in human events rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential our enemies send other people's children on missions of suicide and murder they embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed we stand for a different choice made long ago on the day of our founding we affirm it again today we choose freedom and the dignity of every life steadfast in our purpose we now press on we have known freedom's price we have shown freedom's power and in this great conflict my fellow americans we will see freedom's victory thank you all may god bless ,<nrclex.NRCLex object at

Members of Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we gather tonight, our Nation is at war; our economy is in recession; and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers.', 'Yet, the state of our Union has never been stronger.', 'We last met in an hour of shock and suffering.', ""In 4 short months, our Nation has comforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rallied a great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan's terrorist training camps, saved a people from starvation, and freed a country from brutal oppression."", 'The American flag flies again over our Embassy in Kabul.', 'Terrorists who once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay.', 'And terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own.', 'America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror.', ""We'll be partners in rebuilding that country."", 'And this evening we welcomed the distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan, Chairman Hamid Karzai.', 'The last time we met in this Chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school.', ""Today, women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new Government."", ""And we welcome the new Minister of Women's Affairs, Dr. Sima Samar."", 'Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United States military.', 'When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill.', 'And tonight, thanks to them, we are winning the war on terror.', 'The men and women of our Armed Forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the United States: Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans and continents, on mountaintops and in caves, you will not escape the justice of this Nation.', 'For many Americans, these 4 months have brought sorrow and pain that will never completely go away.', 'Every day a retired firefighter returns to Ground Zero to feel closer to his two sons who died there.', 'At a memorial in New York, a little boy left his football with a note for his lost father: ""Dear Daddy, please take this to heaven.', 'I don\'t want to play football until I can play with you again some day.""', 'Last month, at the grave of her husband, Micheal, a CIA officer and marine who died in Mazar-e-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of farewell, ""Semper Fi, my love.""', 'Shannon is with us tonight.', 'Shannon, I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause is just, and our country will never forget the debt we owe Micheal and all who gave their lives for freedom.', 'Our cause is just, and it continues.', 'Our discoveries in Afghanistan confirmed our worst fears and showed us the true scope of the task ahead.', ""We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in videos where they laugh about the loss of innocent life."", 'And the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design.', 'We have found diagrams of American nuclear powerplants and public water facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons, surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout the world.', 'What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there, our war against terror is only beginning.', ""Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's camps, and so were tens of thousands of others."", 'Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking timebombs, set to go off without warning.', 'Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners, hundreds of terrorists have been arrested.', 'Yet, tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large.', 'These enemies view the entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they are.', 'So long as training camps operate, so long as nations harbor terrorists, freedom is at risk.', 'And America and our allies must not and will not allow it.', 'Our Nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives.', 'First, we will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice.', 'And second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world.', 'Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries.', 'A terrorist underworld, including groups like Hamas, Hizballah, Islamic Jihad, Jaish-e-Mohammed, operates in remote jungles and deserts and hides in the centers of large cities.', 'While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is acting elsewhere.', ""We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to train that country's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an American and still hold hostages."", 'Our soldiers, working with the Bosnian Government, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our Embassy.', 'Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia.', 'My hope is that all nations will heed our call and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own.', 'Many nations are acting forcefully.', 'Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf.', 'But some governments will be timid in the face of terror.', 'And make no mistake about it: If they do not act, America will.', 'Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction.', 'Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th, but we know their true nature.', 'North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.', ""Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom."", 'Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror.', 'The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade.', 'This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children.', 'This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors.', 'This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.', 'States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.', 'By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger.', 'They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred.', 'They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States.', 'In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.', 'We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction.', 'We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from sudden attack.', ""And all nations should know: America will do what is necessary to ensure our Nation's security."", ""We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side."", 'I will not wait on events while dangers gather.', 'I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer.', ""The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons."", 'Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun.', 'This campaign may not be finished on our watch; yet, it must be and it will be waged on our watch.', ""We can't stop short."", 'If we stop now, leaving terror camps intact and terrorist states unchecked, our sense of security would be false and temporary.', ""History has called America and our allies to action, and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight."", 'Our first priority must always be the security of our Nation, and that will be reflected in the budget I send to Congress.', 'My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy.', 'September the 11th brought out the best in America and the best in this Congress.', 'And I join the American people in applauding your unity and resolve.', 'Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home.', ""I'm a proud member of my party."", 'Yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and create jobs in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republicans, not as Democrats but as Americans.', 'It costs a lot to fight this war.', 'We have spent more than a billion dollars a month, over $30 million a day, and we must be prepared for future operations.', 'Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we need more of them.', 'We need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely.', 'Our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons, the best equipment, the best training, and they also deserve another pay raise.', 'My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades, because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too high.', 'Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay.', 'The next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect our citizens and strengthen our Nation against the ongoing threat of another attack.', 'Time and distance from the events of September the 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons.', 'America is no longer protected by vast oceans.', 'We are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad and increased vigilance at home.', 'My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border security, and improved intelligence.', 'We will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases.', ""We'll increase funding to help States and communities train and equip our heroic police and firefighters."", 'We will improve intelligence collection and sharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the security of air travel, and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of visitors to the United States.', 'Homeland security will make America not only stronger but, in many ways, better.', 'Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health.', 'Stronger police and fire departments will mean safer neighborhoods.', 'Stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal drugs.', 'And as government works to better secure our homeland, America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens.', 'A few days before Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger lighting a match.', 'The crew and passengers quickly subdued the man, who had been trained by Al Qaida and was armed with explosives.', 'The people on that plane were alert and, as a result, likely saved nearly 200 lives.', 'And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants Hermis Moutardier and Christina Jones.', 'Once we have funded our national security and our homeland security, the final great priority of my budget is economic security for the American people.', 'To achieve these great national objectives—to win the war, protect the homeland, and revitalize our economy—our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short term, so long as Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible manner.', 'We have clear priorities, and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas.', ""We'll prevail in the war, and we will defeat this recession."", 'Americans who have lost their jobs need our help, and I support extending unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage.', 'Yet, American workers want more than unemployment checks; they want a steady paycheck.', 'When America works, America prospers, so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word: jobs.', ""Good jobs begin with good schools, and here we've made a fine start."", 'Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind.', 'I was proud to work with members of both parties: Chairman John Boehner and Congressman George Miller; Senator Judd Gregg.', 'And I was so proud of our work, I even had nice things to say about my friend Ted Kennedy.', ""I know the folks at the Crawford coffee shop couldn't believe I'd say such a thing— —but our work on this bill shows what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on results."", 'There is more to do.', 'We need to prepare our children to read and succeed in school with improved Head Start and early childhood development programs.', 'We must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for America, a quality teacher in every classroom.', 'Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy.', 'This Congress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil.', 'Good jobs depend on expanded trade.', 'Selling into new markets creates new jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority.', 'On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of Representatives has acted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation.', 'Good jobs depend on sound tax policy.', 'Last year, some in this Hall thought my tax relief plan was too small; some thought it was too big.', 'But when the checks arrived in the mail, most Americans thought tax relief was just about right.', 'Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling the child credit, and ending the death tax.', ""For the sake of long-term growth and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax cuts permanent."", 'The way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend.', ""For the sake of American workers, let's pass a stimulus package."", 'Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform.', 'As we reauthorize these important reforms, we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job.', 'Americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health security.', ""I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patients' bill of rights, to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage, to approve an historic increase in the spending for veterans' health, and to give seniors a sound and modern Medicare system that includes coverage for prescription drugs."", 'A good job should lead to security in retirement.', 'I ask Congress to enact new safeguards for 401(k) and pension plans.', 'Employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company fails.', 'Through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements, corporate America must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct.', 'Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of Social Security, and we will.', 'We must make Social Security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them.', 'Members, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other issues: productive farm policy; a cleaner environment; broader homeownership, especially among minorities; and ways to encourage the good work of charities and faith-based groups.', ""I ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we've applied to our war against terrorism."", ""During these last few months, I've been humbled and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of testing."", 'Our enemies believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness.', 'They were as wrong as they are evil.', 'The American people have responded magnificently, with courage and compassion, strength and resolve.', 'As I have met the heroes, hugged the families, and looked into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in awe of the American people.', 'And I hope you will join me—I hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one American for the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our Nation in crisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush.', 'None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September the 11th.', 'Yet, after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves.', 'We were reminded that we are citizens with obligations to each other, to our country, and to history.', 'We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate and more about the good we can do.', 'For too long our culture has said, ""If it feels good, do it.""', 'Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed, ""Let\'s roll.""', 'In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like.', 'We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self.', ""We've been offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass."", 'My call tonight is for every American to commit at least 2 years, 4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime, to the service of your neighbors and your Nation.', 'Many are already serving, and I thank you.', ""If you aren't sure how to help, I've got a good place to start."", 'To sustain and extend the best that has emerged in America, I invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps.', 'The Freedom Corps will focus on three areas of need: responding in case of crisis at home; rebuilding our communities; and extending American compassion throughout the world.', 'One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security.', 'America needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major emergencies, volunteers to help police and fire departments, transportation and utility workers well-trained in spotting danger.', 'Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities.', 'We need mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in prison.', 'And we need more talented teachers in troubled schools.', 'USA Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers.', 'And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world.', 'So we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps, double its volunteers over the next 5 years, and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the Islamic world.', 'This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity, a moment we must seize to change our culture.', 'Through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I know we can overcome evil with greater good.', 'And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace.', 'All fathers and mothers, in all societies, want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and violence.', 'No people on Earth yearn to be oppressed or aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police.', 'If anyone doubts this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic ""street"" greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration.', ""Let the skeptics look to Islam's own rich history, with its centuries of learning and tolerance and progress."", 'America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere.', 'No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them.', 'We have no intention of imposing our culture.', 'But America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance.', 'America will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values around the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment.', 'We seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror.', 'In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries.', 'America is working with Russia and China and India, in ways we have never before, to achieve peace and prosperity.', 'In every region, free markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift lives.', 'Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia and Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of terror cannot stop the momentum of freedom.', 'The last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would return to normal.', 'In some ways, it has.', 'In others, it never will.', 'Those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by them.', ""We've come to know truths that we will never question: Evil is real, and it must be opposed."", 'Beyond all differences of race or creed, we are one country, mourning together and facing danger together.', 'Deep in the American character, there is honor, and it is stronger than cynicism.', 'And many have discovered again that even in tragedy—especially in tragedy— God is near.', ""In a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty, that we've been called to a unique role in human events."", 'Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential.', ""Our enemies send other people's children on missions of suicide and murder."", 'They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed.', 'We stand for a different choice, made long ago on the day of our founding.', 'We affirm it again today.', 'We choose freedom and the dignity of every life.', 'Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on.', ""We have known freedom's price."", ""We have shown freedom's power."", ""And in this great conflict, my fellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory."", 'Thank you

"Today the President signed a proclamation granting permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) status to the People's Republic of China and terminating application of Jackson-Vanik provisions to China. Taking effect January 1, 2002, this is the final step in normalizing U.S.-China trade relations and welcoming China into a global, rules-based trading system. It marks the completion of more than a decade of bilateral and multilateral negotiations, and the beginning of a process of working constructively with China to help it fully implement its commitments on trade liberalization. Congress authorized these actions subject to the President's certification that the final terms of entry for China into the WTO were at least equivalent to those agreed to bilaterally between the United States and China in 1999, and China's successful entry into the WTO.

"Thank you, all. Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguished guests, and my fellow citizens. The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings. As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our Nation, and I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace. I am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow. We have a place, all of us, in a long story, a story we continue but whose end we will not see. It is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, the story of a slaveholding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer. It is the American story, a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals. The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born. Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And though our Nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course. Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country. It is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. Even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel. While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our Union, is a serious work of leaders and citizens and every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity. I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves, who creates us equal, in His image, and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward. America has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests, and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American. Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our Nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion, and character. America at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness. Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most. We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment; it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment. America at its best is also courageous. Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common good. Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations. Together we will reclaim America's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives. We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent. And we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans. We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge. We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors. The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in the world, by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We will defend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our Nation birth. America at its best is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation's promise. And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God; they are failures of love. And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls. Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers; they are citizens—not problems but priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless. Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools. Yet, compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer. Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws. Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty. But we can listen to those who do. And I can pledge our Nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side. America at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected. Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats; it is a call to conscience. And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments. And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free. Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency, which give direction to our freedom. Sometimes in life we're called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, ""Every day we are called to do small things with great love."" The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone. I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to serve the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it, as well. In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times. What you do is as important as anything Government does. I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort, to defend needed reforms against easy attacks, to serve your Nation, beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens: Citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character. Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no Government program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it. After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson, ""We know the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?"" Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changes accumulate, but the themes of this day, he would know: our Nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity. We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose. Yet, his purpose is achieved in our duty. And our duty is fulfilled in service to one another. Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life. This work continues, the story goes on, and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm. God bless you all, and God bless America.",inaugural-address-52.txt,22,thank you all chief justice rehnquist president carter president bush president clinton distinguished guests and my fellow

with grace.', ""I am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow."", 'We have a place, all of us, in a long story, a story we continue but whose end we will not see.', 'It is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, the story of a slaveholding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.', 'It is the American story, a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals.', 'The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.', 'Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws.', 'And though our Nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.', ""Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea."", 'Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.', 'Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country.', 'It is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along.', 'Even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.', 'While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice of our own country.', 'The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.', 'And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent but not a country.', 'We do not accept this, and we will not allow it.', 'Our unity, our Union, is a serious work of leaders and citizens and every generation.', 'And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.', 'I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves, who creates us equal, in His image, and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.', 'America has never been united by blood or birth or soil.', 'We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests, and teach us what it means to be citizens.', 'Every child must be taught these principles.', 'Every citizen must uphold them.', 'And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.', ""Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our Nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion, and character."", 'America at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility.', 'A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.', 'Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stakes of our debates appear small.', 'But the stakes for America are never small.', 'If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led.', 'If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism.', 'If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.', 'We must live up to the calling we share.', 'Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment; it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.', 'And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.', 'America at its best is also courageous.', 'Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common good.', 'Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us.', 'We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.', ""Together we will reclaim America's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives."", 'We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent.', 'And we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.', 'We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge.', 'We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.', 'The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in the world, by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom.', 'We will defend our allies and our interests.', 'We will show purpose without arrogance.', 'We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength.', 'And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our Nation birth.', 'America at its best is compassionate.', ""In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation's promise."", 'And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault.', 'Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God; they are failures of love.', 'And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.', 'Where there is suffering, there is duty.', 'Americans in need are not strangers; they are citizens—not problems but priorities.', 'And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.', 'Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools.', 'Yet, compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.', ""And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer."", 'Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.', 'Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty.', 'But we can listen to those who do.', 'And I can pledge our Nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.', 'America at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.', 'Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats; it is a call to conscience.', 'And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment.', 'We find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments.', 'And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.', 'Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency, which give direction to our freedom.', ""Sometimes in life we're called to do great things."", 'But as a saint of our times has said, ""Every day we are called to do small things with great love.""', 'The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.', 'I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to serve the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it, as well.', 'In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.', 'What you do is as important as anything Government does.', 'I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort, to defend needed reforms against easy attacks, to serve your Nation, beginning with your neighbor.', 'I ask you to be citizens: Citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character.', 'Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves.', 'When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no Government program can replace it.', 'When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.', 'After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson, ""We know the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.', 'Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?""', 'Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration.', ""The years and changes accumulate, but the themes of this day, he would know: our Nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity."", ""We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose."", 'Yet, his purpose is achieved in our duty.', 'And our duty is fulfilled in service to one another.', 'Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.', 'This work continues, the story goes on, and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.', 'God bless you all, and God bless America.']","['Thank', 'you', ',', 'all.',

"To the House of Representatives: I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 2419, the ""Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008."" For a year and a half, I have consistently asked that the Congress pass a good farm bill that I can sign. Regrettably, the Congress has failed to do so. At a time of high food prices and record farm income, this bill lacks program reform and fiscal discipline. It continues subsidies for the wealthy and increases farm bill spending by more than $20 billion, while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase. It is inconsistent with our objectives in international trade negotiations, which include securing greater market access for American farmers and ranchers. It would needlessly expand the size and scope of government. Americans sent us to Washington to achieve results and be good stewards of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This bill violates that fundamental commitment. In January 2007, my Administration put forward a fiscally responsible farm bill proposal that would improve the safety net for farmers and move current programs toward more market-oriented policies. The bill before me today fails to achieve these important goals. At a time when net farm income is projected to increase by more than $28 billion in 1 year, the American taxpayer should not be forced to subsidize that group of farmers who have adjusted gross incomes of up to $1.5 million. When commodity prices are at record highs, it is irresponsible to increase government subsidy rates for 15 crops, subsidize additional crops, and provide payments that further distort markets. Instead of better targeting farm programs, this bill eliminates the existing payment limit on marketing loan subsidies. Now is also not the time to create a new uncapped revenue guarantee that could cost billions of dollars more than advertised. This is on top of a farm bill that is anticipated to cost more than $600 billion over 10 years. In addition, this bill would force many businesses to prepay their taxes in order to finance the additional spending. This legislation is also filled with earmarks and other ill-considered provisions. Most notably, H.R. 2419 provides: $175 million to address water issues for desert lakes; $250 million for a 400,000-acre land purchase from a private owner; funding and authority for the noncompetitive sale of National Forest land to a ski resort; and $382 million earmarked for a specific watershed. These earmarks, and the expansion of Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements, have no place in the farm bill. Rural and urban Americans alike are frustrated with excessive government spending and the funneling of taxpayer funds for pet projects. This bill will only add to that frustration. The bill also contains a wide range of other objectionable provisions, including one that restricts our ability to redirect food aid dollars for emergency use at a time of great need globally. The bill does not include the requested authority to buy food in the developing world to save lives. Additionally, provisions in the bill raise serious constitutional concerns. For all the reasons outlined above, I must veto H.R. 2419, and I urge the Congress to extend current law for a year or more. I veto this bill fully aware that it is rare for a stand-alone farm bill not to receive the President's signature, but my action today is not without precedent. In 1956, President Eisenhower stood firmly on principle, citing high crop subsidies and too much government control of farm programs among the reasons for his veto. President Eisenhower wrote in his veto message, ""Bad as some provisions of this bill are, I would have signed it if in total it could be interpreted as sound and good for farmers and the nation."" For similar reasons, I am vetoing the bill before me today. GEORGE W.

"Thank you all very much. Okay. I know you all are anxious to get back to class.  So please be seated.  Thank you for such a warm welcome. It's great to be in the home of the Big Blue, Hamilton High School. I want to thank you all for coming. I particularly want to thank my friend the Governor of the great State of Ohio, Governor Taft, for being here. I want to thank Tracey Miller for being so hospitable. I want to thank all who have come to witness this historic moment. For those of you who have studied the history of our Government, you know most bills are signed at the White House. But I decided to sign this bill in one of the most important places in America, a public school. We've got large challenges here in America. There's no greater challenge than to make sure that every child—and all of us on this stage mean every child, not just a few children—every single child, regardless of where they live, how they're raised, the income level of their family, every child receive a first-class education in America. And as you know, we've got another challenge, and that's to protect America from evil ones. And I want to assure the seniors and juniors and sophomores here at Hamilton High School that the effort that this great country is engaged in, the effort to defend freedom and to defend our people, the effort to rout out terror wherever it exists, is noble and just and right, and your great country will prevail in this effort. I long for peace. But I also understand that if we do not lead the world against terror, that your children and your grandchildren will not grow up in a society that is as free as the society we have today. Freedom is the precious gift that one generation can pass to the next. It is a gift and a promise that I intend to keep to the American children. And we owe the children of America a good education. And today begins a new era, a new time in public education in our country. As of this hour, America's schools will be on a new path of reform and a new path of results. Our schools will have higher expectations. We believe every child can learn. Our schools will have greater resources to help meet those goals. Parents will have more information about the schools and more say in how their children are educated. From this day forward, all students will have a better chance to learn, to excel, and to live out their dreams. I want to thank the Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, for being here and for his leadership. I asked Rod to join my administration because I wanted somebody who understood what it meant to run a school district in Washington, DC. I didn't need somebody that based his knowledge on theory; I wanted somebody who based his knowledge on experience. And Rod was a teacher, a school board member, and the superintendent of the Houston Independent School District. He did a fine job there, and he's doing a fine job in Washington. Reaching this moment has not been easy, as you could tell from Chairman Boehner's discussion.  But we made it because of the willingness of four fine leaders to do what was right for America. We made it because proud Members of the House and the Senate, loyal to their parties, decided to set partisan politics aside and focus on what was right for America. I want to thank George Miller. I call him Big George, Jorge el Grande.  As John mentioned, George and I aren't from the same political ideology; except when I met with George in Austin, I could tell he shares the same passion I share for making sure that every child gets educated. And he, like me and others, realize that a system that simply shuffles children through the schools is a system that's going to leave people behind, and so we made up our minds right then and there to do something about it. I appreciate so very much my friend Judd Gregg from the State of New Hampshire being here. He was my campaign manager in the New Hampshire primary. I still invited him to come with me.  After here, we're going to New Hampshire. I look forward to singing Judd's praises because he is a solid, solid United States Senator, honest, full of integrity, and like the others here, he buckled down to do what was right for the children. And then, of course, there's Senator Edward Kennedy. And the folks at the Crawford coffee shop——would be somewhat shocked when I told them I actually like the fellow.  He is a fabulous United States Senator. When he's against you, it's tough; when he's with you, it is a great experience. And I'm signing this bill here because it's the home of the chairman, John Boehner. John did a really good job. He shepherded the process. He made sure people showed up for the meetings. He was dogged in his determination to get this bill done. It would not have happened without his leadership. And all four of these Members up here need to be proud of the legacy they have left behind. This is a good bill for the American children, and I'm proud to sign it in their presence. There are other Members of the Congress who are here, as well, and I want to thank them for coming. Senator Evan Bayh from the State of Indiana is here. Evan, thank you for your leadership on education reform. Senator Mike DeWine of your State of Ohio, who helped author— who helped to author the safe and drug-free schools part of this bill, thank you for your leadership. Steve Chabot of Ohio, Van Hilleary of Tennessee, thank you both for coming, as well. In that box is the bill. I don't intend to read it all.  It's not exactly light reading.  But if you were to read it all, you would find that it contains some very important principles that will help guide our public school system for the next decades. First principle is accountability. Every school has a job to do, and that's to teach the basics and teach them well. If we want to make sure no child is left behind, every child must learn to read, and every child must learn to add and subtract. So in return for Federal dollars, we are asking States to design accountability systems to show parents and teachers whether or not children can read and write and add and subtract in grades three through eight. The fundamental principle of this bill is that every child can learn, we expect every child to learn, and you must show us whether or not every child is learning. I read a quote one time from a young lady in New York. She said, ""I don't ever remember taking an exam. They just kept passing me along. I ended up dropping out in the seventh grade. I basically felt nobody cared."" The story of children being just shuffled through the system is one of the saddest stories of America. ""Let's just move them through."" It's so much easier to move a child through than trying to figure out how to solve a child's problems. The first step to making sure that a child is not shuffled through is to test that child as to whether or not he or she can read and write or add and subtract. The first way to solve a problem is to diagnose it. And so, what this bill says, it says every child can learn. And we want to know early, before it's too late, whether or not a child has a problem in learning. I understand taking tests aren't fun. Too bad.  We need to know in America. We need to know whether or not children have got the basic education. No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance. No longer is it acceptable to keep results away from parents. One of the interesting things about this bill, it says that we're never going to give up on a school that's performing poorly, that when we find poor performance, a school will be given time and incentives and resources to correct their problems. A school will be given time to try other methodologies, perhaps other leadership, to make sure that people can succeed. If, however, schools don't perform, if, however, given the new resources, focused resources, they are unable to solve the problem of not educating their children, there must be real consequences. There must be a moment in which parents can say, ""I've had enough of this school."" Parents must be given real options in the face of failure in order to make sure reform is meaningful. And so, therefore, this bill's second principle is, is that we trust parents to make the right decisions for their children. Any school that doesn't perform, any school that cannot catch up and do its job, a parent will have these options: a better public school, a tutor, or a charter school. We do not want children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach. The third principle of this bill is that we have got to trust the local folks on how to achieve standards, to meet the standards. In Washington, there's some smart people there, but the people who care most about the children in Hamilton are the citizens of Hamilton. The people who care most about the children in this school are the teachers and parents and school board members. And therefore, schools not only have the responsibility to improve; they now have the freedom to improve. The Federal Government will not micromanage how schools are run. We believe strongly— we believe strongly the best path to education reform is to trust the local people. And so the new role of the Federal Government is to set high standards, provide resources, hold people accountable, and liberate school districts to meet the standards. I can't think of any better way to say to teachers, ""We trust you."" And first of all, we've got to thank all the teachers who are here. I thank you for teaching. Yours is indeed a noble profession, and our society is better off because you decided to teach. And by saying we trust local folks, we're really saying we trust you. We trust you. We want you to have as much flexibility as possible to see to it that every child that walks in your classroom can succeed. So thank you for what you do. And a fourth principle is that we're going to spend more money, more resources, but they'll be directed at methods that work, not feel-good methods, not sound-good methods, but methods that actually work, particularly when it comes to reading. We're going to spend more on our schools, and we're going to spend it more wisely. If we've learned anything over the last generations, money alone doesn't make a good school. It certainly helps. But as John mentioned, we've spent billions of dollars with lousy results. So now it's time to spend billions of dollars and get good results. As John mentioned, too many of our kids can't read. You know, a huge percentage of children in poverty can't read at grade level. That's not right in America. We're going to win the war overseas, and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home, as well. And so this bill—so this bill focuses on reading. It sets a grand goal for the country: Our children will be reading by the third grade. That's not an impossible goal. It's a goal we must meet if we want every child to succeed. And so, therefore, we tripled the amount of Federal funding for scientifically based early reading programs. We've got money in there to make sure teachers know how to teach what works. We've got money in there to help promote proven methods of instruction. There are no more excuses, as far as I'm concerned, about not teaching children how to read. We know what works, the money is now available, and it's up to each local district to make sure it happens. It's up to you, the citizens of Hamilton, to make sure no child is left behind. And the Federal Government can spend money, and we can help set standards, and we can insist upon accountability. But the truth of the matter is, our schools will flourish when citizens join in the noble cause of making sure no child is left behind. This is the end of a legislative process. Signing this bill is the end of a long, long time of people sitting in rooms trying to hammer out differences. It's a great symbol of what is possible in Washington when good people come together to do what's right. But it's just the beginning of change. And now it's up to you, the local citizens of our great land, the compassionate, decent citizens of America, to stand up and demand high standards, and to demand that no child—not one single child in America—is left behind. Thank you for letting us come. May God bless.

it's up to each local district to make sure it happens it's up to you the citizens of hamilton to make sure no child is left behind and the federal government can spend money and we can help set

a legislative process signing this bill is the end of a long long time of people sitting in rooms trying to hammer out differences it's a great symbol of what is possible in washington when good people come together to do what's right but it's just the beginning of change and now it's up to you the local citizens of our great land the compassionate decent citizens of america to stand up and

thank my friend the Governor of the great State of Ohio, Governor Taft, for being here.', 'I want to thank Tracey Miller for being so hospitable.', 'I want to thank all who have come to witness this historic moment.', 'For those of you who have studied the history of our Government, you know most bills are signed at the White House.', 'But I decided to sign this bill in one of the most important places in America, a public school.', ""We've got large challenges here in America."", ""There's no greater challenge than to make sure that every child—and all of us on this stage mean every child, not just a few children—every single child, regardless of where they live, how they're raised, the income level of their family, every child receive a first-class education in America."", ""And as you know, we've got another challenge, and that's to protect America from evil ones."", 'And I want to assure the seniors and juniors and sophomores here at Hamilton High School that the effort that this great country is engaged in, the effort to defend freedom and to defend our people, the effort to rout out terror wherever it exists, is noble and just and right, and your great country will prevail in this effort.', 'I long for peace.', 'But I also understand that if we do not lead the world against terror, that your children and your grandchildren will not grow up in a society that is as free as the society we have today.', 'Freedom is the precious gift that one generation can pass to the next.', 'It is a gift and a promise that I intend to keep to the American children.', 'And we owe the children of America a good education.', 'And today begins a new era, a new time in public education in our country.', ""As of this hour, America's schools will be on a new path of reform and a new path of results."", 'Our schools will have higher expectations.', 'We believe every child can learn.', 'Our schools will have greater resources to help meet those goals.', 'Parents will have more information about the schools and more say in how their children are educated.', 'From this day forward, all students will have a better chance to learn, to excel, and to live out their dreams.', 'I want to thank the Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, for being here and for his leadership.', 'I asked Rod to join my administration because I wanted somebody who understood what it meant to run a school district in Washington, DC.', ""I didn't need somebody that based his knowledge on theory; I wanted somebody who based his knowledge on experience."", 'And Rod was a teacher, a school board member, and the superintendent of the Houston Independent School District.', ""He did a fine job there, and he's doing a fine job in Washington."", ""Reaching this moment has not been easy, as you could tell from Chairman Boehner's discussion."", 'But we made it because of the willingness of four fine leaders to do what was right for America.', 'We made it because proud Members of the House and the Senate, loyal to their parties, decided to set partisan politics aside and focus on what was right for America.', 'I want to thank George Miller.', 'I call him Big George, Jorge el Grande.', ""As John mentioned, George and I aren't from the same political ideology; except when I met with George in Austin, I could tell he shares the same passion I share for making sure that every child gets educated."", ""And he, like me and others, realize that a system that simply shuffles children through the schools is a system that's going to leave people behind, and so we made up our minds right then and there to do something about it."", 'I appreciate so very much my friend Judd Gregg from the State of New Hampshire being here.', 'He was my campaign manager in the New Hampshire primary.', 'I

integrity, and like the others here, he buckled down to do what was right for the children."", ""And then, of course, there's Senator Edward Kennedy."", 'And the folks at the Crawford coffee shop——would be somewhat shocked when I told them I actually like the fellow.', 'He is a fabulous United States Senator.', ""When he's against you, it's tough; when he's with you, it is a great experience."", ""And I'm signing this bill here because it's the home of the chairman, John Boehner."", 'John did a really good job.', 'He shepherded the process.', 'He made sure people showed up for the meetings.', 'He was dogged in his determination to get this bill done.', 'It would not have happened without his leadership.', 'And all four of these Members up here need to be proud of the legacy they have left behind.', ""This is a good bill for the American children, and I'm proud to sign it in their presence."", 'There are other Members of the Congress who are here, as well, and I want to thank them for coming.', 'Senator Evan Bayh from the State of Indiana is here.', 'Evan, thank you for your leadership on education reform.', 'Senator Mike DeWine of your State of Ohio, who helped author— who helped to author the safe and drug-free schools part of this bill, thank you for your leadership.', 'Steve Chabot of Ohio, Van Hilleary of Tennessee, thank you both for coming, as well.', 'In that box is the bill.', ""I don't intend to read it all."", ""It's not exactly light reading."", 'But if you were to read it all, you would find that it contains some very important principles that will help guide our public school system for the next decades.', 'First principle is accountability.', ""Every school has a job to do, and that's to teach the basics and teach them well."", 'If we want to make sure no child is left behind, every child must learn to read, and every child must learn to add and subtract.', 'So in return for Federal dollars, we are asking States to design accountability systems to show parents and teachers whether or not children can read and write and add and subtract in grades three through eight.', 'The fundamental principle of this bill is that every child can learn, we expect every child to learn, and you must show us whether or not every child is learning.', 'I read a quote one time from a young lady in New York.', 'She said, ""I don\'t ever remember taking an exam.', 'They just kept passing me along.', 'I ended up dropping out in the seventh grade.', 'I basically felt nobody cared.""', 'The story of children being just shuffled through the system is one of the saddest stories of America.', '""Let\'s just move them through.""', ""It's so much easier to move a child through than trying to figure out how to solve a child's problems."", 'The first step to making sure that a child is not shuffled through is to test that child as to whether or not he or she can read and write or add and subtract.', 'The first way to solve a problem is to diagnose it.', 'And so, what this bill says, it says every child can learn.', ""And we want to know early, before it's too late, whether or not a child has a problem in learning."", ""I understand taking tests aren't fun."", 'Too bad.', 'We need to know in America.', 'We need to know whether or not children have got the basic education.', 'No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance.', 'No longer is it acceptable to keep results away from parents.', ""One of the interesting things about this bill, it says that we're never going to give up on a school that's performing poorly, that when we find poor performance, a school will be given time and incentives and resources to correct their problems."", 'A school will be given time to try other methodologies, perhaps other leadership, to make sure that people can succeed.', ""If, however, schools don't perform, if, however, given the new resources, focused resources, they are unable to solve the problem of not educating their children, there must be real consequences."", 'There must be a moment in which parents can say, ""I\'ve had enough of this school.""', 'Parents must be given real options in the face of failure in order to make sure reform is meaningful.', ""And so, therefore, this bill's second principle is, is that we trust parents to make the right decisions for their children."", ""Any school that doesn't perform, any school that cannot catch up and do its job, a parent will have these options: a better public school, a tutor, or a charter school."", 'We do not want children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach.', 'The third principle of this bill is that we have got to trust the local folks on how to achieve standards, to meet the standards.', ""In Washington, there's some smart people there, but the people who care most about the children in Hamilton are the citizens of Hamilton."", 'The people who care most about the children in this school are the teachers and parents and school board members.', 'And therefore, schools not only have the responsibility to improve; they now have the freedom to improve.', 'The Federal Government will not micromanage how schools are run.', 'We believe strongly— we believe strongly the best path to education reform is to trust the local people.', 'And so the new role of the Federal Government is to set high standards, provide resources, hold people accountable, and liberate school districts to meet the standards.', 'I can\'t think of any better way to say to teachers, ""We trust you.""', ""And first of all, we've got to thank all the teachers who are here."", 'I thank you for teaching.', 'Yours is indeed a noble profession, and our society is better off because you decided to teach.', ""And by saying we trust local folks, we're really saying we trust you."", 'We trust you.', 'We want you to have as much flexibility as possible to see to it that every child that walks in your classroom can succeed.', 'So thank you for what you do.', ""And a fourth principle is that we're going to spend more money, more resources, but they'll be directed at methods that work, not feel-good methods, not sound-good methods, but methods that actually work, particularly when it comes to reading."", ""We're going to spend more on our schools, and we're going to spend it more wisely."", ""If we've learned anything over the last generations, money alone doesn't make a good school."", 'It certainly helps.', ""But as John mentioned, we've spent billions of dollars with lousy results."", ""So now it's time to spend billions of dollars and get good results."", ""As John mentioned, too many of our kids can't read."", ""You know, a huge percentage of children in poverty can't read at grade level."", ""That's not right in America."", ""We're going to win the war overseas, and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home, as well."", 'And so this bill—so this bill focuses on reading.', 'It sets a grand goal for the country: Our children will be reading by the third grade.', ""That's not an impossible goal."", ""It's a goal we must meet if we want every child to succeed."", 'And so, therefore, we tripled the amount of Federal funding for scientifically based early reading programs.', ""We've got money in there to make sure teachers know how to teach what works."", ""We've got money in there to help promote proven methods of instruction."", ""There are no more excuses, as far as I'm concerned, about not teaching children how to read."", ""We know what works, the money is now available, and it's up to each local district to make sure it happens."", ""It's up to you, the citizens of Hamilton, to make sure no child is left behind."", 'And the Federal Government can spend money, and we can help set standards, and we can insist upon accountability.', 'But the truth of the matter is, our schools will flourish when citizens join in the noble cause of making sure no child is left behind.', 'This is the end of a legislative process.', 'Signing this bill is the end of a long, long time of people sitting in rooms trying to hammer out differences.', ""It's a great symbol of what is possible in Washington when good people come together to do what's right."", ""But it's just the beginning of change."", ""And now it's up to you, the local citizens of our great land, the compassionate, decent citizens of America, to stand up and demand high standards, and to demand that no child—not one single child in America—is left behind."", 'Thank you for letting us come.', 'May

"For too long, the citizens of the Middle East have lived in the midst of death and fear. The hatred of a few holds the hopes of many hostage. The forces of extremism and terror are attempting to kill progress and peace by killing the innocent, and this casts a dark shadow over an entire region. For the sake of all humanity, things must change in the Middle East. It is untenable for Israeli citizens to live in terror. It is untenable for Palestinians to live in squalor and occupation. And the current situation offers no prospect that life will improve. Israeli citizens will continue to be victimized by terrorists, and so Israel will continue to defend herself. And the situation of the Palestinian people will grow more and more miserable. My vision is two states living side by side in peace and security. There is simply no way to achieve that peace until all parties fight terror. Yet, at this critical moment, if all parties will break with the past and set out on a new path, we can overcome the darkness with the light of hope. Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership, so that a Palestinian state can be born. I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. I call upon them to build a practicing democracy, based on tolerance and liberty. If the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America and the world will actively support their efforts. If the Palestinian people meet these goals, they will be able to reach agreement with Israel and Egypt and Jordan on security and other arrangements for independence. And when the Palestinian people have new leaders, new institutions, and new security arrangements with their neighbors, the United States of America will support the creation of a Palestinian state whose borders and certain aspects of its sovereignty will be provisional until resolved as part of a final settlement in the Middle East. In the work ahead, we all have responsibilities. The Palestinian people are gifted and capable, and I am confident they can achieve a new birth for their nation. A Palestinian state will never be created by terror. It will be built through reform, and reform must be more than cosmetic change or a veiled attempt to preserve the status quo. True reform will require entirely new political and economic institutions, based on democracy, market economics, and action against terrorism. Today, the elected Palestinian legislature has no authority, and power is concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few. A Palestinian state can only serve its citizens with a new constitution which separates the powers of government. The Palestinian Parliament should have the full authority of a legislative body. Local officials and government ministers need authority of their own and the independence to govern effectively. The United States, along with the European Union and Arab states, will work with Palestinian leaders to create a new constitutional framework and a working democracy for the Palestinian people. And the United States, along with others in the international community, will help the Palestinians organize and monitor fair, multiparty local elections by the end of the year, with national elections to follow. Today, the Palestinian people live in economic stagnation, made worse by official corruption. A Palestinian state will require a vibrant economy, where honest enterprise is encouraged by honest government. The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank stand ready to work with Palestinians on a major project of economic reform and development. The United States, the EU, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund are willing to oversee reforms in Palestinian finances, encouraging transparency and independent auditing. And the United States, along with our partners in the developed world, will increase our humanitarian assistance to relieve Palestinian suffering. Today, the Palestinian people lack effective courts of law and have no means to defend and vindicate their rights. A Palestinian state will require a system of reliable justice to punish those who prey on the innocent. The United States and members of the international community stand ready to work with Palestinian leaders to establish finance—establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. Today, Palestinian authorities are encouraging, not opposing, terrorism. This is unacceptable. And the United States will not support the establishment of a Palestinian state until its leaders engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists and dismantle their infrastructure. This will require an externally supervised effort to rebuild and reform the Palestinian security services. The security system must have clear lines of authority and accountability and a unified chain of command. America is pursuing this reform, along with key regional states. The world is prepared to help. Yet ultimately, these steps toward statehood depend on the Palestinian people and their leaders. If they energetically take the path of reform, the rewards can come quickly. If Palestinians embrace democracy, confront corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support for the creation of a provisional state of Palestine. With a dedicated effort, this state could rise rapidly, as it comes to terms with Israel, Egypt, and Jordan on practical issues such as security. The final borders, the capital, and other aspects of this state's sovereignty will be negotiated between the parties as part of a final settlement. Arab states have offered their help in this process, and their help is needed. I've said in the past that nations are either with us or against us in the war on terror. To be counted on the side of peace, nations must act. Every leader actually committed to peace will end incitement to violence in official media and publicly denounce homicide bombings. Every nation actually committed to peace will stop the flow of money, equipment, and recruits to terrorist groups seeking the destruction of Israel, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. Every nation actually committed to peace must block the shipment of Iranian supplies to these groups and oppose regimes that promote terror, like Iraq. And Syria must choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling terrorist organizations. Leaders who want to be included in the peace process must show by their deeds an undivided support for peace. And as we move toward a peaceful solution, Arab states will be expected to build closer ties of diplomacy and commerce with Israel, leading to full normalization of relations between Israel and the entire Arab world. Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. A stable, peaceful Palestinian state is necessary to achieve the security that Israel longs for. So I challenge Israel to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. As we make progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell committee, Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop. The Palestinian economy must be allowed to develop. As violence subsides, freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life. Palestinian legislators and officials, humanitarian and international workers must be allowed to go about the business of building a better future. And Israel should release frozen Palestinian revenues into honest, accountable hands. I've asked Secretary Powell to work intensively with Middle Eastern and international leaders to realize the vision of a Palestinian state, focusing them on a comprehensive plan to support Palestinian reform and institution-building. Ultimately, Israelis and Palestinians must address the core issues that divide them if there is to be a real peace, resolving all claims and ending the conflict between them. This means that the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 will be ended through a settlement negotiated between the parties, based on U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, with Israeli withdrawal to secure and recognized borders. We must also resolve questions concerning Jerusalem, the plight and future of Palestinian refugees, and a final peace between Israel and Lebanon, and Israel and a Syria that supports peace and fights terror. All who are familiar with the history of the Middle East realize that there may be setbacks in this process. Trained and determined killers, as we have seen, want to stop it. Yet the Egyptian and Jordanian peace treaties with Israel remind us that with determined and responsible leadership, progress can come quickly. As new Palestinian institutions and new leaders emerge, demonstrating real performance on security and reform, I expect Israel to respond and work toward a final status agreement. With intensive effort by all, this agreement could be reached within 3 years from now. And I and my country will actively lead toward that goal. I can understand the deep anger and anguish of the Israeli people. You've lived too long with fear and funerals, having to avoid markets and public transportation, and forced to put armed guards in kindergarten classrooms. The Palestinian Authority has rejected your offered hand and trafficked with terrorists. You have a right to a normal life. You have a right to security, and I deeply believe that you need a reformed, responsible Palestinian partner to achieve that security. I can understand the deep anger and despair of the Palestinian people. For decades you've been treated as pawns in the Middle East conflict. Your interests have been held hostage to a comprehensive peace agreement that never seems to come, as your lives get worse year by year. You deserve democracy and the rule of law. You deserve an open society and a thriving economy. You deserve a life of hope for your children. An end to occupation and a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state may seem distant, but America and our partners throughout the world stand ready to help— help you make them possible as soon as possible. If liberty can blossom in the rocky soil of the West Bank and Gaza, it will inspire millions of men and women around the globe who are equally weary of poverty and oppression, equally entitled to the benefits of democratic government. I have a hope for the people of Muslim countries. Your commitments to morality and learning and tolerance led to great historical achievements, and those values are alive in the Islamic world today. You have a rich culture, and you share the aspirations of men and women in every culture. Prosperity and freedom and dignity are not just American hopes or Western hopes. They are universal, human hopes. And even in the violence and turmoil of the Middle East, America believes those hopes have the power to transform lives and nations. This moment is both an opportunity and a test for all parties in the Middle East, an opportunity to lay the foundations for future peace, a test to show who is serious about peace and who is not. The choice here is stark and simple. The Bible says, ""I have set before you life and death... therefore choose life."" The time has arrived for everyone in this conflict to choose peace and hope and life.

Palestinians to live in squalor and occupation.', 'And the current situation offers no prospect that life will improve.', 'Israeli citizens will continue to be victimized by terrorists, and so Israel will continue to defend herself.', 'And the situation of the Palestinian people will grow more and more miserable.', 'My vision is two states living side by side in peace and security.', 'There is

with the light of hope.', 'Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership, so that a Palestinian state can be born.', 'I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror.', 'I call upon them to build a practicing democracy, based on tolerance and liberty.', 'If the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America and the world will actively support their efforts.', 'If the Palestinian people meet these goals, they will be able to reach agreement with Israel and Egypt and Jordan on security and other arrangements for independence.', 'And when the Palestinian people have new leaders, new institutions, and new security arrangements with their neighbors, the United States of America will support the creation of a Palestinian state whose borders and certain aspects of its sovereignty will be provisional until resolved as part of a final settlement in the Middle East.', 'In the work ahead, we all have responsibilities.', 'The Palestinian people are gifted and capable, and I am confident they can achieve a new birth for their nation.', 'A Palestinian state will never be created by terror.', 'It will be built through reform, and reform must be more than cosmetic change or a veiled attempt to preserve the status quo.', 'True reform will require entirely new political and economic institutions, based on democracy, market economics, and action against terrorism.', 'Today, the elected Palestinian legislature has no authority, and power is concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few.', 'A Palestinian state can only serve its citizens with a new constitution which separates the powers of government.', 'The Palestinian Parliament should have the full authority of a legislative body.', 'Local officials and government ministers need authority of their own and the independence to govern effectively.', 'The United States, along with the European Union and Arab states, will work with Palestinian leaders to create a new constitutional framework and a working democracy for the Palestinian people.', 'And the United States, along with others in the international community, will help the Palestinians organize and monitor fair, multiparty local elections by the end of the year, with national elections to follow.', 'Today, the Palestinian people live in economic stagnation, made

will require a system of reliable justice to punish those who prey on the innocent.', 'The United States and members of the international community stand ready to work with Palestinian leaders to establish finance—establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary.', 'Today, Palestinian authorities are encouraging, not opposing, terrorism.', 'This is unacceptable.', 'And the United

externally supervised effort to rebuild and reform the Palestinian security services.', 'The security system must have clear lines of authority and accountability and a unified chain of command.',

act.', 'Every leader actually committed to peace will end incitement to violence in official media and publicly denounce homicide bombings.', 'Every nation actually committed to peace will stop the flow of money, equipment, and recruits to terrorist groups seeking the destruction of Israel, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah.', 'Every nation actually committed to peace must block the shipment of Iranian supplies to these groups and oppose regimes that promote terror, like Iraq.', 'And Syria must choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling terrorist organizations.', 'Leaders who want to be included in the peace process must show by their deeds an undivided support for peace.', 'And as we move toward a peaceful solution, Arab states will be expected to build closer ties of diplomacy and commerce with Israel, leading to full normalization of relations between Israel and the entire Arab world.', 'Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.', ""Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy."", 'A stable, peaceful Palestinian state is necessary to achieve the security that Israel longs for.', 'So I challenge Israel to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.', 'As we make progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000.', 'And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell committee, Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop.', 'The Palestinian economy must be allowed to develop.', 'As violence subsides, freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life.', 'Palestinian legislators and officials, humanitarian and international workers must be allowed to go about the business of building a better future.', 'And Israel should release frozen Palestinian revenues into honest, accountable hands.', ""I've asked Secretary Powell to work intensively with Middle Eastern and international leaders to realize the vision of a Palestinian state, focusing them on a comprehensive plan to support Palestinian reform and institution-building."", 'Ultimately, Israelis and Palestinians must address the core issues that divide them if there is to be a real peace, resolving all claims and ending the conflict between them.', 'This means that the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 will be ended through a settlement negotiated between the parties, based on U.N.', 'Resolutions 242 and 338, with Israeli withdrawal to secure and recognized borders.', 'We must also resolve questions concerning Jerusalem, the plight and future of Palestinian refugees, and a final peace between Israel and Lebanon, and Israel and a Syria that supports peace and fights terror.', 'All who are familiar with the history of the Middle East realize that there may be setbacks in this process.', 'Trained and determined killers, as we have seen, want to stop it.', 'Yet the Egyptian and Jordanian peace treaties with Israel remind us that with determined and responsible leadership, progress can come quickly.', 'As new Palestinian institutions and new leaders emerge, demonstrating real performance on security and reform, I expect Israel to respond and work toward a final status agreement.', 'With intensive effort by all, this agreement could be reached within 3 years from now.', 'And I and my country will actively lead toward that goal.', 'I can understand the deep anger and anguish of the Israeli people.', ""You've lived too long with fear and funerals, having to avoid markets and public transportation, and forced to put armed guards in kindergarten classrooms."", 'The Palestinian Authority has rejected your offered hand and trafficked with terrorists.', 'You have a right to a normal life.', 'You have a right to security, and I deeply believe

seem distant, but America and our partners throughout the world stand ready to help— help you make them possible as soon as possible.', 'If liberty can blossom in the rocky soil of the West Bank and Gaza, it will inspire millions of men and women around the globe who are equally weary of poverty and oppression, equally entitled to the benefits of democratic government.', 'I have a hope for the

culture, and you share the aspirations of men and women in every culture.', 'Prosperity and freedom and dignity are not just American hopes or Western hopes.', 'They are universal, human hopes.', 'And

"Good evening. Twelve weeks ago, I asked the Congress to pass an emergency war spending bill that would provide our brave men and women in uniform with the funds and flexibility they need. Instead, Members of the House and the Senate passed a bill that substitutes the opinions of politicians for the judgment of our military commanders. So a few minutes ago, I vetoed the bill. Tonight I will explain the reasons for this veto and my desire to work with Congress to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. We can begin tomorrow with a bipartisan meeting with the congressional leaders here at the White House. Here is why the bill Congress passed is unacceptable. First, the bill would mandate a rigid and artificial deadline for American troops to begin withdrawing from Iraq. That withdrawal could start as early as July 1st, and it would have to start no later than October 1st, regardless of the situation on the ground. It makes no sense to tell the enemy when you plan to start withdrawing. All the terrorists would have to do is mark their calendars and gather their strength and begin plotting how to overthrow the Government and take control of the country of Iraq. I believe setting a deadline for withdrawal would demoralize the Iraqi people, would encourage killers across the broader Middle East, and send a signal that America will not keep its commitments. Setting a deadline for withdrawal is setting a date for failure, and that would be irresponsible. Second, the bill would impose impossible conditions on our commanders in combat. After forcing most of our troops to withdraw, the bill would dictate the terms on which the remaining commanders and troops could engage the enemy. That means American commanders in the middle of a combat zone would have to take fighting directions from politicians 6,000 miles away in Washington, DC. This is a prescription for chaos and confusion, and we must not impose it on our troops. Third, the bill is loaded with billions of dollars in nonemergency spending that has nothing to do with fighting the war on terror. Congress should debate these spending measures on their own merits and not as a part of an emergency funding bill for our troops. The Democratic leaders know that many in Congress disagree with their approach and that there are not enough votes to override the veto. I recognize that many Democrats saw this bill as an opportunity to make a political statement about their opposition to the war. They've sent their message. And now it is time to put politics behind us and support our troops with the funds they need. Our troops are carrying out a new strategy with a new commander, General David Petraeus. The goal of this new strategy is to help the Iraqis secure their capital so they can make progress toward reconciliation and build a free nation that respects the rights of its people, upholds the rule of law, and fights extremists and radicals and killers alongside the United States in this war on terror. In January, General Petraeus was confirmed by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate. In February, we began sending the first of the reinforcements he requested. Not all of these reinforcements have arrived in Baghdad. And as General Petraeus has said, it will be the end of summer before we can assess the impact of this operation. Congress ought to give General Petraeus's plan a chance to work. In the months since our military has been implementing this plan, we've begun to see some important results. For example, Iraqi and coalition forces have closed down an Al Qaida car bomb network; they've captured a Shi'a militia leader implicated in the kidnaping and killing of American soldiers; they've broken up a death squad that had terrorized hundreds of residents in a Baghdad neighborhood. Last week, General Petraeus was in Washington to brief me, and he briefed Members of Congress on how the operation is unfolding. He noted that one of the most important indicators of progress is the level of sectarian violence in Baghdad. And he reported that since January, the number of sectarian murders has dropped substantially. Even as sectarian attacks have declined, we continue to see spectacular suicide attacks that have caused great suffering. These attacks are largely the work of Al Qaida, the enemy that everyone agrees we should be fighting. The objective of these Al Qaida attacks is to subvert our efforts by reigniting the sectarian violence in Baghdad and breaking support for the war here at home. In Washington last week, General Petraeus explained it this way: ""Iraq is, in fact, the central front of all Al Qaida's global campaign."" Al Qaida's role makes it—the conflict in Iraq far more complex than a simple fight between Iraqis. It's true that not everyone taking innocent life in Iraq wants to attack America here at home, but many do. Many also belong to the same terrorist network that attacked us on September the 11th, 2001, and wants to attack us here at home again. We saw the death and destruction Al Qaida inflicted on our people when they were permitted a safe haven in Afghanistan. For the security of the American people, we must not allow Al Qaida to establish a new safe haven in Iraq. We need to give our troops all the equipment and the training and protection they need to prevail. That means that Congress needs to pass an emergency war spending bill quickly. I've invited leaders of both parties to come to the White House tomorrow and to discuss how we can get these vital funds to our troops. I am confident that with good will on both sides, we can agree on a bill that gets our troops the money and flexibility they need as soon as possible. The need to act is urgent. Without a war funding bill, the military has to take money from some other account or training program so the troops in combat have what they need. Without a war funding bill, the Armed Forces will have to consider cutting back on buying new equipment or repairing existing equipment. Without a war funding bill, we add to the uncertainty felt by our military families. Our troops and their families deserve better, and their elected leaders can do better. Here in Washington, we have our differences on the way forward in Iraq, and we will debate them openly. Yet whatever our differences, surely we can agree that our troops are worthy of this funding and that we have a responsibility to get it to them without further delay. Thank you for listening. May God bless our troops.",remarks-returning-without-approval-the-house-representatives-the-us-troop-readiness.txt,43,good evening twelve weeks ago i asked the congress to pass an emergency war spending bill that would provide our brave men and women in uniform with the funds and flexibility they need instead members of the house and the senate passed a bill that substitutes the opinions of politicians for the judgment of our military commanders so a few minutes ago i vetoed the bill tonight i will explain the reasons for this veto and my desire to work with congress to resolve this matter as quickly as possible we can begin tomorrow with a bipartisan meeting with the congressional leaders here at the white house here is why the bill congress passed is unacceptable first the bill would mandate a rigid and artificial deadline for american troops to begin withdrawing from iraq that withdrawal could start as early as july 1st and it would have to start no later than october 1st regardless of the situation on the ground it makes no sense to tell the enemy when you plan to start withdrawing all the terrorists would have to do is mark their calendars and gather their strength and begin plotting how to overthrow the government and take control of the country of iraq i believe setting a deadline for withdrawal would demoralize the iraqi people would encourage killers across the broader middle east and send a signal that america will not keep its commitments setting a deadline for withdrawal is setting a date for failure and that would be irresponsible second the bill would impose impossible conditions on our commanders in combat after forcing most of our troops to withdraw the bill would dictate the terms on which the remaining commanders and troops could engage the enemy that means american commanders in the middle of a combat zone would have to take fighting directions from politicians 6 000 miles away in washington dc this is a prescription for chaos and

"Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 114, a resolution ""To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against Iraq."" By passing H.J. Res. 114, the Congress has demonstrated that the United States speaks with one voice on the threat to international peace and security posed by Iraq. It has also clearly communicated to the international community, to the United Nations Security Council, and, above all, to Iraq's tyrannical regime a powerful and important message: the days of Iraq flouting the will of the world, brutalizing its own people, and terrorizing its neighbors must—and will—end. Iraq will either comply with all U.N. resolutions, rid itself of weapons of mass destruction, and in its support for terrorists, or it will be compelled to do so. I hope that Iraq will choose compliance and peace, and I believe passage of this resolution makes that choice more likely. The debate over this resolution in the Congress was in the finest traditions of American democracy. There is no social or political force greater than a free people united in a common and compelling objective. It is for that reason that I sought an additional resolution of support from the Congress to use force against Iraq, should force become necessary. While I appreciate receiving that support, my request for it did not, and my signing this resolution does not, constitute any change in the long-standing positions of the executive branch on either the President's constitutional authority to use force to deter, prevent, or respond to aggression or other threats to U.S. interests or on the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution. On the important question of the threat posed by Iraq, however, the views and goals of the Congress, as expressed in H.J. Res. 114 and previous congressional resolutions and enactments, and those of the President are the same. Throughout the past months, I have had extensive consultations with the Congress, and I look forward to continuing close consultation in the months ahead. In addition, in accordance with section 4 of H.J. Res. 114, I intend to submit written reports to the Congress on matters relevant to this resolution every 60 days. To the extent possible, I intend to consolidate information in these reports with the information concerning Iraq submitted to the Congress pursuant to previous, related resolutions. The United States is committed to a world in which the people of all nations can live in freedom, peace, and security. Enactment of H.J. Res. 114 is an important step on the road toward such a world.

"Good morning. Laura and I are pleased to be here with Al Gonzales, his wife, Becky, and his wonderful family. Thank you all for coming. I turned to Al and said, ""It seems like they're cheering pretty loud."" He said, ""Most of them work for me now.""  For the past decade, Al has been a close adviser, an honorable public servant, and a dear friend. Now he assumes a new title. Today it is my honor to call this son of Humble, Texas, the 80th Attorney General of the United States. I appreciate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor for administering the oath and admitting publicly that she was born in Texas.  I want to thank the current and former members of my Cabinet who are here. I appreciate Senator Pat Leahy, Senator Judd Gregg and Kathy, Senator John Cornyn and Sandy, Senator Mel Martinez for joining us today. I thank Congresswoman Grace Napolitano for joining us. I thank the other distinguished guests who are here, and I thank the Texans who have come up. As Attorney General Gonzales begins his service, he will build on the outstanding work of Attorney General John Ashcroft. Over the past 4 years, Attorney General Ashcroft has started the Department of Justice on the right course in the war on terror. He's helped reduce violent crime to a 30-year low. He's taken vital new steps to protect children from exploitation. John Ashcroft has worked tirelessly to make our Nation safer and more just, and America is thankful for your lifetime of service. Attorney General Gonzales now joins every employee at the Department of Justice in an urgent mission to protect the United States from another terrorist attack. Few periods in our history have demanded so much of this Department. With Al's principled leadership, the Department of Justice will continue this important mission and will defend the security of all Americans and the liberty of all Americans. The men and women of this Department are meeting your duty every day, from your headquarters in Washington to U.S. attorneys offices across the country, to dangerous posts overseas. You've reorganized your resources to confront the threats of this new war. You've devised effective methods to investigate and prosecute terrorists. Some of you have volunteered for demanding new duties in complex areas such as intelligence and counterterrorism. Our Nation is grateful for your dedication and sacrifice, and in return, we must provide you all the tools you need to do your job. And one of those tools is the PATRIOT Act, which has been vital to our success in tracking terrorists and disrupting their plans. Many key elements of the PATRIOT Act are now set to expire at the end of this year. We must not allow the passage of time or the illusion of safety to weaken our resolve in this new war. To protect the American people, Congress must promptly renew all provisions of the PATRIOT Act this year. Your mission to ensure equal justice for every American extends far beyond the war on terror. By aggressively prosecuting gun criminals and drug dealers, you make neighborhoods safer for all families. By holding corporate wrongdoers to account, you build confidence in our economy. By protecting victims of child abuse and domestic violence, you help guarantee a compassionate society. And by defending the civil rights of every American, you affirm the dignity of every life and you set an example of liberty for the entire world. As we strive to provide equal justice, we must ensure that Americans of all races and backgrounds trust the legal system. By spreading the use of DNA analysis, we can solve more crimes, lock up more criminals, and prevent wrongful conviction. So I've asked Congress for more than a billion dollars over 5 years to expand this vital technology. And to help ensure that the death penalty is applied justly, I've also requested new funding to train prosecutors, judges, and defense counsels in capital cases. To maintain confidence in the legal system, we must ensure that judges faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. I've a constitutional responsibility to nominate well-qualified men and women for the Federal courts. I have done so. And I've benefited greatly from the sound judgment of Attorney General Gonzales on picking qualified people to serve on our benches. I will continue to rely on his advice. And the United States Senate must also live up to its constitutional responsibility. Every judicial nominee deserves a prompt hearing and an up-or-down vote on the floor of the United States Senate. As he embarks on all these duties, Attorney General Gonzales has my complete confidence. From his early days of selling soda at Rice University football games to his time in the Air Force to his distinguished legal career and service on the White House staff, Al has been a model of courage and character to his fellow citizens. I've witnessed his integrity, his decency, his deep dedication to the cause of justice. Now he will advance that cause as the Attorney General and ensure that more Americans have the opportunity to achieve their dreams. Attorney General—or General—congratulations.

"Good morning. I first want to say how pleased I am that the House yesterday passed on a realistic, commonsense budget to the Senate. I appreciated the vote. They did the right thing. It's a budget that meets our Nation's priorities. It's also a budget that leaves ample room for meaningful, real, long-lasting tax relief. I look forward to working with the Senate to get a budget passed. I'm also deeply concerned about the escalating violence in the Middle East. It is claiming the lives of innocent civilians on both sides. The tragic cycle of incitement, provocation, and violence has gone on far too long. Both sides must take important steps to calm the situation now. The Palestinian Authority should speak out publicly and forcibly, in a language that the Palestinian people—to condemn violence and terrorism. It should arrest those who perpetrated the terrorist acts. It should resume security cooperation with Israel. The Government of Israel, for its part, should exercise restraint in its military response. It should take steps to restore normalcy to the lives of the Palestinian people by easing closures and removing checkpoints. Last week Prime Minister Sharon assured me that his government wants to move in this direction, and I urge Israel to do so. I'll be meeting with Egypt's President Mubarak next Monday and Jordan's King Abdullah the week after, to seek their help in defusing the tensions. Egypt and Jordan are two of our most important partners in the region, and their role is crucial. I've asked Secretary Powell to call Chairman Arafat today and contact other leaders to urge them to stand against violence. Our diplomats in the region are fully engaged in this effort. Our goal is to encourage a series of reciprocal and parallel steps by both sides that will halt the escalation of violence, provide safety and security for civilians on both sides, and restore normalcy to the lives of everyone in the region. A lasting peace in the region will come only when the parties agree directly on its terms. This week I vetoed an unbalanced U.N. resolution, because it tried to force the adoption of a mechanism on which both parties did not agree. My approach will be to facilitate the parties' work in finding their own solution to peace. We seek to build a stable foundation for restoring confidence, rebuilding security cooperation, and resuming a political dialog between the parties.

senate to get a budget passed i'm also deeply concerned about the escalating violence in the middle east it is claiming the lives of innocent civilians on both sides the tragic cycle of incitement provocation and violence has gone on far too long both sides must take important steps to calm the situation now the palestinian authority should speak out publicly and forcibly in a language that the palestinian people'to condemn violence and terrorism it should arrest those who perpetrated the terrorist acts it should resume security cooperation with israel the government of israel for its part should exercise restraint in its military response it should take steps to restore normalcy to the lives of the palestinian people by easing closures and removing checkpoints last week prime minister sharon assured me that his government wants to move in this direction and i urge israel to do so i'll be meeting with egypt's president mubarak next monday and jordan's king abdullah the week after to

"Vice President Cheney, Mr. Chief Justice, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, Members of the United States Congress, reverend clergy, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed. At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use but by the history we have seen together. For a half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical, and then there came a day of fire. We have seen our vulnerability, and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny, prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder, violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended borders and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom. We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world. America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this Earth has rights and dignity and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of heaven and Earth. Across the generations, we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. Now, it is the urgent requirement of our Nation's security and the calling of our time. So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities. And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own. America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way. The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. America's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence is considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom's cause. My most solemn duty is to protect this Nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve and have found it firm. We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation, the moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains or that women welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies. We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people. America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies. Yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators. They are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the long run, there is no justice without freedom and there can be no human rights without human liberty. Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty, though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty will come to those who love it. Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world. All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: The United States will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you. Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are, the future leaders of your free country. The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ""Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it."" The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people, you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side. And all the allies of the United States can know: We honor your friendship; we rely on your counsel; and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies. The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies' defeat. Today I also speak anew to my fellow citizens. From all of you I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this Nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well, a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power. It burns those who fight its progress. And one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world. A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause, in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy, the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments, the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives, and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice. All Americans have witnessed this idealism and some for the first time. I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is fragile and evil is real and courage triumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself, and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character. America has need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home, the unfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty. In America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the GI bill of rights. And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time. To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings, and health insurance, preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal. In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character, on integrity and tolerance toward others and the rule of conscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before, ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever. In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another. Our Nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love. Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time. From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few: Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did our character bring credit to that cause? These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes, and I will strive in good faith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and fellowship of our Nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good and the victims of disaster are given hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captives are set free. We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom, not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability—it is human choices that move events; not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation—God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order of the ages, when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty, when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ""Freedom Now,"" they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty. When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, ""It rang as if it meant something."" In our time, it means something still. America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength, tested but not weary, we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom. May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.",inaugural-address-13.txt,21,vice president cheney mr chief justice president carter president bush president clinton members of

Clinton, Members of the United States Congress, reverend clergy, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country.', 'I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.', 'At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use but by the history we have seen together.', 'For a half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders.', 'After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical, and then there came a day of fire.', 'We have seen our vulnerability, and we have seen its deepest source.', 'For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny, prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder, violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended borders and raise a mortal threat.', 'There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.', 'We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands.', 'The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.', ""America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one."", 'From the day of our founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this Earth has rights and dignity and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of heaven and Earth.', 'Across the generations, we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave.', 'Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation.', 'It is the honorable achievement of our fathers.', ""Now, it is the urgent requirement of our Nation's security and the calling of our time."", 'So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.', 'This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary.', 'Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities.', 'And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own.', 'America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling.', 'Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.', 'The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations.', 'The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it.', ""America's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence is considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom's cause."", 'My most solemn duty is to protect this Nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats.', ""Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve and have found it firm."", 'We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation, the moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right.', 'America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains or that women welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.', 'We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people.', ""America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies."", 'Yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators.', 'They are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed.', 'In the long run, there is no justice without freedom and there can be no human rights without human liberty.', 'Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty, though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt.', 'Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals.', 'Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul.', 'We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery.', 'Liberty will come to those who love it.', 'Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world.', 'All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: The United States will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors.', 'When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.', 'Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are, the future leaders of your free country.', 'The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ""Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.""', 'The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people, you must learn to trust them.', 'Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side.', 'And all the allies of the United States can know: We honor your friendship; we rely on your counsel; and we depend on your help.', ""Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies."", ""The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies' defeat."", 'Today I also speak anew to my fellow citizens.', 'From all of you I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure.', 'Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon.', 'Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this Nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom.', 'And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it.', 'By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well, a fire in the minds of men.', 'It warms those who feel its power.', 'It burns those who fight its progress.', 'And one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.', 'A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause, in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy, the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments, the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies.', 'Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives, and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice.', 'All Americans have witnessed this idealism and some for the first time.', 'I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes.', 'You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers.', 'You have seen that life is fragile and evil is real and courage triumphs.', 'Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself, and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character.', 'America has

businesses, retirement savings, and health insurance, preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society.', 'By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal.', ""In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character, on integrity and tolerance toward others and the rule of conscience in our own lives."", 'Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self.', 'That edifice of character is built in

ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy and a heart for the weak."", 'Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another.', 'Our Nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love.', 'Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth.', 'And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time.', 'From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many.', 'From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few: Did our generation advance the cause of freedom?', 'And did our character bring credit to that cause?', 'These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom.', 'We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes, and I will strive in good faith to heal them.', 'Yet those divisions do not define America.', 'We felt the unity and fellowship of our Nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart.', 'And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good and the victims of disaster are given hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captives are set free.', 'We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom, not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability—it is human choices that move events; not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation—God moves and chooses as He wills.', 'We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul.', 'When our Founders declared a new order of the ages, when

"Thank you all very much. It's a windy day out there, which is——a good day for a windy speaker.  I'm honored to be your guest here at the Economic Club of Chicago. I want to thank Michael for the invitation. I like a short introduction. He didn't let me down.  For 75 years, the business leaders and the entrepreneurs in the club have helped make Chicago a prosperous and energetic city. You understand the concerns facing American workers and employers, and you believe, as I do, that we must address those concerns honestly and aggressively. Today in Washington, a new Congress convenes, and I will ask members of both parties to work with me to secure our economic future. We cannot be satisfied until every part of our economy is healthy and vigorous. We will not rest until every business has a chance to grow and every person who wants to find work can find a job. So today I'm announcing a growth-and-jobs plan to strengthen America's economy, specific proposals to increase the momentum of our economic recovery. And this is a good city to give it in. This is one of America's great cities. And one of the reasons why is because you have a great mayor in Richard Daley. We're from different political parties, but we have some things in common: We both married above ourselves.  It is good to see the first lady of Chicago here. Thank you for coming. We both have famous and influential brothers.  Our dads spent a little time in politics.  And we love our country more than we love our political parties. The thing I like most about the mayor is he gets the job done for the people of Chicago. And Mr. Mayor, I'm proud to call you friend. And I want to thank another proud son of Chicago, Rod Blagojevich, for being with us today as well. He's soon to have the second-best job in America, being a Governor. I congratulate him on his election. I look forward to working with him for the good of Illinois and for the good of our country. Thank you for coming, Governor-elect. I appreciate you being here. I flew in today with the Senator from Illinois, Peter Fitzgerald. I appreciate his leadership. I appreciate his friendship. And as we speak, the Senate is debating the Fitzgerald bill which will extend unemployment benefits to those who are looking for work in America. And Peter, I want to thank you for your leadership on this important issue. And on that very same airplane was traveling with me Steve Friedman, who is the new Director of the National Economic Council. I'm honored that such a respected economic leader has agreed to join my administration. I appreciate the fact that he's willing to take time away from a comfortable private life to serve our country. He is a strong addition to a great economic team, and I want to thank him for his willingness to serve America. Thank you for coming, Steve. I've also named two other good people to join this team. John Snow is my nominee to serve as the Secretary of Treasury. Bill Donaldson is my nominee to be the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. They will fill essential positions in my administration, and I urge the Congress to confirm them quickly. As the new Congress meets today, our duties to this Nation are clear. We have a responsibility to meet great dangers to our country, wherever they gather. We will continue to hunt down the terrorists all across the world. Cell by cell, we are disrupting their plans. One by one, we're showing these merciless killers the meaning of justice. We're also confronting the outlaw regime in Iraq that lives by violence and deception and is arming to threaten the civilized world. The world's demands are clear: For the sake of peace, Saddam Hussein must disarm himself of all weapons of mass destruction and prove that he has done so. Should he choose the other course, in the name of peace, the United States will lead a coalition of the willing to disarm the Iraqi regime of weapons of mass destruction and free the Iraqi people. And we're dealing with North Korea as well. It's a regime that has expelled international inspectors and is attempting to defy the world through its nuclear weapons program. The United States and other nations will confront this threat as well. In this case, I believe that by working with countries in the region, diplomacy will work. We have no aggressive intent, no argument with the North Korean people. We're interested in peace on the Korean Peninsula. As we deal with the dangers of our time, different circumstances require different strategies. Yet our resolve in each case will be clear: We will not permit any regime to threaten the freedom and security of the American people or our allies and friends around the world. Even as we confront these dangers, you need to know I know we have needs here at home, especially the need for a vigorous and growing economy. Too many Americans today are wondering about our economy. They're asking, ""How is the economy really doing?"" Well, the American economy is the strongest and most resilient economy in the world. In spite of the terrible shocks that our Nation has received, our economy is growing, and the entrepreneurial spirit in America is strong. We've made great progress these past 2 years. Remember, in the summer of 2000, during the Presidential campaign, the market had started on a steady decline. Job growth started to dwindle. The economy had begun to slow. When I took office, the signs of recession were real. So I worked with the United States Congress to reduce income taxes for everyone who pays them. More than 100 million individuals, families, and sole proprietorships received tax relief. This tax relief was the largest in a generation, and it gave the economy a boost just at the right time, ensuring that the recession was one of the shortest and shallowest in modern American history. Americans should be able to count on those tax cuts as they plan their financial futures. So I will continue to press the Congress to make these tax cuts, including the end of the death tax, permanent. We know that the tax cuts worked, and Americans deserve to know their tax cuts will not be taken away. We faced a second test with the attacks of September the 11th, 2001. These attacks caused terrible suffering and a massive disruption of the economy. Flights were canceled. Many hotels and stores were empty. Stock trading was halted for nearly a week. So we acted: We reopened the markets; we helped the people of New York City recover; we assisted the airlines; we provided tax incentives for business investment; and we passed terrorism insurance so building and real estate projects could go forward. And then our economy was tested a third time, when Americans discovered serious abuses of trust by some corporate leaders. So we passed historic reforms to assure corporate integrity, to punish wrongdoers, and defend the interests of workers and investors. Corporate greed and malfeasance cause innocent people to lose their jobs, their savings, and often their confidence in the American system. For the sake of justice, and for the sake of every honest business in America, I have made this commitment: Corporate misdeeds will be investigated; they will be prosecuted; and they will be punished. We have met the tests before us because the American people have worked hard through difficult times. And now our country has entered its second year of economic growth. Our trade with other nations is expanding, bringing lower prices that come from imports and better jobs that come from exports. More Americans are buying and building houses, a central part of the American Dream. The homeownership rate is now 68 percent, close to the highest ever. Low interest rates have allowed Americans to tap the rising value of their homes. In 2002, refinancings added more than $100 billion to American pocketbooks, money that helped renovate homes or pay off debt or cover tuition or purchase other goods. The most important indicator of our economic strength is the growing skill and efficiency of the American worker. The productivity of American workers went up by 5.6 percent over the last four quarters for which we have data, the best increase since 1973. As productivity rises, so do wages and our standard of living. Nationwide, incomes are rising faster than inflation. We have the most productive, creative, and promising economic system the world has ever seen. America sets the standard for scientific research, engineering skill, and medical innovation. Our companies and universities attract talent from every single continent. Investors from around the world know America is the safest place to put their money. People around the world who search for a better life still dream of working and living in the United States of America. All these conditions create a platform for long-term growth and prosperity. Yet, in spite of successes, we have more work to do, because too many of our citizens who want to work cannot find a job and many employers lack the confidence to invest and create new jobs. We can help assure greater success tomorrow with the policies we choose today. Now, these policies must recognize that our $10 trillion economy is sustained by the labor and enterprise of the American people. Government spends a lot of money, but it doesn't build factories. It doesn't invest in companies or do the work that makes the economy go. The role of Government is not to manage or control the economy from Washington, DC, but to remove obstacles standing in the way for faster economic growth. That's our role. And those obstacles are clear. Many jobs are lost in America because Government imposes unreasonable regulations, and many jobs are lost because the lawsuit culture of this country imposes unreasonable costs. I will continue to press for legal and regulatory reform. But today—today I want to talk about these concerns: Americans carry a heavy burden of taxes and debt that could slow consumer spending. I'm troubled by that. I'm also troubled by the fact that our tax system unfairly penalizes some productive investments. And I worry about people who are out of work. They need our help, both in short-term benefits and long-term opportunity. By directly confronting each of these challenges, we can preserve the hard-won gains our economy has made and advance toward greater prosperity. Our first challenge is to allow Americans to keep more of their money so they can spend and save and invest—the millions of individual decisions that support the market, that support business, and help create jobs. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of our economy. It has been the driving force of our recovery. Yet there are warning signs I won't ignore, and I hope the Congress doesn't ignore either. Many Americans live in constant and increasing personal debt, with credit card bills so heavy they often cannot pay much more than the monthly minimum. Millions of citizens spend their entire adult lives living paycheck to paycheck, never getting a chance to save for their children's education or their own retirement. Americans today are paying about a third of their income in taxes. All of this puts pressure on family budget and therefore clouds our economic future. Americans facing these struggles are due to receive additional tax relief in 2004 and again in 2006. Republicans and Democrats in Congress already approved these tax rate reductions. And the time to deliver the tax rate reductions is now, when they can do the most good for the American businesses. For the sake of economic vitality, I'm asking Congress to make all the tax rate reductions effective this year. The tax cuts should be retroactive to January 1st. Upon passage, I'll order the Treasury Department to immediately adjust the amount of money withheld for income taxes, so that Americans will keep more of their paychecks right away. By speeding up the income-tax cuts, we will speed economic recovery and the pace of job creation. If tax relief is good enough for Americans 3 years from now, it is good enough for Americans today. An additional beneficiary of this tax cut will be small businesses. About 30 million Americans include small-business income when they file their individual tax returns with the IRS. Faster tax relief will help these businesses to expand sooner, to hire new people faster, and to build a stronger foundation for the recovery. We also know that middle-income families need additional relief. So today I'm asking Congress to speed up three other tax reductions promised in 2001, tax reductions that will help our middle-income families. Instead of slowly reducing the marriage penalty until 2009, we should do it now, to help 35 million married couples. Instead of waiting until 2008 to move more taxpayers from the 15-percent bracket to the lowest bracket of 10 percent, we should make that change now and help 2 million working Americans. And instead of gradually raising the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child by the year of 2010, for the benefit of 26 million families, we should raise it now. These tax reductions will bring real and immediate benefits to middle-income Americans. Ninety-two million Americans will keep an average of $1,083 more of their own money. A family of four with two earners and $39,000 in income will receive more than $1,100 in tax relief, real money to help pay the bills and push the economy forward. And the sooner Congress acts, the sooner the help will come. Taken together, these income-tax cuts will put an additional $70 billion to work in the private economy over the next 18 months. And there's no better way to help our economy grow than to leave more money in the hands of the men and women who earned it. Our second challenge is to encourage greater investment by individuals and small businesses, the kind of investing that builds personal wealth and helps company expand and creates new jobs. We are increasingly a nation of owners, who invest for retirement and the other financial challenges of life. One-half of American households own stock, either directly or through pension funds. And we have an obligation to make sure, now more than ever, that American investors are treated fairly. We can begin by treating investors fairly and equally in our tax laws. As it is now, many investments are taxed not once but twice. First, the IRS taxes a company on its profit. Then it taxes the investors who receive the profits as dividends. The result of this double taxation is that for all the profit a company earns, shareholders who receive dividends keep as little as 40 cents on the dollar. Double taxation is bad for our economy. Double taxation is wrong. Double taxation falls especially hard on retired people. About half of all dividend income goes to America's seniors, and they often rely on those checks for a steady source of income in their retirement. It's fair to tax a company's profits. It's not fair to double-tax by taxing the shareholder on the same profits. So today, for the good of our senior citizens and to support capital formation across the land, I'm asking the United States Congress to abolish the double taxation of dividends. The benefits of this tax relief will be felt throughout the economy. Abolishing double taxation of dividends will leave nearly 35 million Americans with more of their own money to spend and invest, which will promote savings and return as much as $20 billion this year to the private economy. By ending this investment penalty, we will strengthen investor confidence. See, by ending double taxation of dividends, we will increase the return on investing, which will draw more money into the markets to provide capital to build factories, to buy equipment, hire more people. We must also encourage the investments that help turn small businesses into larger ones. Small businesses create the majority of new jobs in America, and they account for half the output of the economy. Currently, tax law permits small firms to write off as expenses up to $25,000 worth of equipment, like computers or machinery that they need. I'm asking the Congress to raise that limit to $75,000 and index that number for inflation. This change, together with the faster rate reductions, will benefit more than 23 million small-business owners. My view is this economy can thrive only
 if our small businesses thrive. And we will provide them every incentive to grow and create more jobs. A third challenge facing our country is the need to help unemployed workers and prepare them for the new jobs of a growing economy. The unemployment rate today is 6 percent. That's low for an economy coming out of recession. It's higher than it should be, and the unemployment rate is projected to rise even further in the short run. This hardship is concentrated in certain regions and in certain industries. Manufacturing jobs have declined for 28 months in a row. You know what I'm talking about here in the Midwest. You're showing signs of recovery here; yet many people here and across this country are still looking for work. A woman in Arkansas tells a typical story. She talked about the fact that her husband was laid off from his job at a local steel mill. And both she and the husband have been looking for a job for quite a while. Here's what she said: ""There's just nothing for me to find. We're trying to save up what little money we have and move to another community and look for jobs there."" Got to be worried about those kind of stories here in America. As we encourage long-term growth, we will not forget the men and women who are struggling today. Close to 70,000 workers each week exhaust their unemployment benefits, and we have an obligation to help our fellow citizens. So I'm asking this new Congress to extend unemployment benefits that expired on December the 28th. And the benefits Congress approves should be retroactive, like the Fitzgerald bill, so that people who lost their benefits last month can receive their benefits in full. Helping America's unemployed workers should be a first order of business in the new Congress, and it looks like it's going to be. We must be more creative when we help those who have the hardest time finding work. To encourage innovation and more choices and to help those who are out of work find the dignity of a new job, today I'm unveiling a new approach to helping unemployed Americans through Personal Reemployment Accounts. Under this new program, Americans who face the greatest difficulties in finding work will receive up to $3,000 to use in their job search. They will have great flexibility in how they use that money. A person with a Reemployment Account will be able to decide whether to use the funds for job training or child care or transportation or even to cover the costs of relocating to another city for a new job. If the job is obtained quickly— within 13 weeks—the worker will be able to keep the cash balance as a ""reemployment bonus."" As we see new economic growth, we will need well-trained workers to fill new jobs. So I'm going to ask the Congress to provide $3.6 billion to the States to pay for the Reemployment Accounts, enough money to help more than a million unemployed men and women across America. In order to strengthen this economy in the future, we must help these Americans today. The jobs-and-growth proposals I've outlined today are a focused plan to encourage consumer spending, to promote small-business growth, to boost confidence in our markets, and to give critical help to unemployed citizens. Overall, this growth package will reduce the tax burden of Americans by $98 billion this year and $670 billion over the next decade. I proposed a bold plan because the need for this plan is urgent, and I urge the Congress to act swiftly and pass this bill. Our Nation has seen 2 years of serious and steady challenges. The recession and the decline in the stock market slowed earnings and cut into tax revenues and created a budget deficit. And in this time of war, I can assure you this Government is spending what is necessary to win the war. But the Congress must also understand this: The American people deserve and expect spending discipline in Washington, DC. With spending discipline and with progrowth policies, we will expand the economy and help bring down this deficit. This growth-and-jobs package is essential in the short run; it's an immediate boost to the economy. And these proposals will help stimulate investment and put more people back to work, is what we want to have happen. They are essential for the long run as well, to lay the groundwork for future growth and future prosperity. That growth will bring the added benefit of higher revenues for the Government, revenues that will keep tax rates low while fulfilling key obligations and protecting programs such as Medicare and Social Security. We're meeting the challenges to America. We're strengthening our economy, and we're taking a battle to our enemies. And we're not going to leave our work half-finished. In the months ahead, we'll confront every threat to the safety and security of the American people. We'll press on to turn our recovery into lasting growth and opportunity that reaches every corner of America. By the courage and by the enterprise of the American people, this great Nation will prosper, and there's no doubt in my mind this great Nation will prevail. May God bless you all, and may God bless America.

is good enough for americans today an additional beneficiary of this tax cut will be small businesses about 30 million americans include small business income when they file their individual tax returns with the irs faster tax relief will help these businesses to expand sooner to hire new people faster and to build a stronger foundation for the recovery we also know that middle income families need additional relief so today i'm asking congress to speed up three other tax reductions promised in 2001 tax reductions that will help our middle income families instead of slowly reducing the marriage penalty until 2009 we should do it now to help 35 million married couples instead of waiting until 2008 to move more taxpayers from the 15 percent bracket to the lowest bracket of 10 percent we should make that change now and help 2 million working americans and instead of gradually raising the child tax credit from 600 to 1 000 per child by the year of 2010 for the benefit of 26 million families we should raise it now these tax reductions will bring real and immediate benefits to middle income americans ninety two million americans will keep an average of 1 083 more of their own money a family of four with two earners and 39 000 in income will receive more than 1 100 in tax relief real money to help pay the bills and push the economy forward and the sooner congress acts the sooner the help will come taken together these income tax cuts will put an additional 70 billion to work in the private economy over the next 18 months and there's no better way to help our economy grow than to leave more money in the hands of the men and women who earned it our second challenge is to encourage greater investment by individuals and small businesses the kind of investing that builds personal wealth and helps company expand and creates new jobs we are increasingly a nation of owners who invest for retirement and the other financial challenges of life one half of american households own stock either directly or through pension funds and we have an obligation to make sure now more than ever that american investors are treated fairly we can begin by treating investors fairly and equally in our tax laws as it is now many investments are taxed not once but twice first the irs taxes a company on its profit then it taxes the investors who receive the profits as dividends the result of this double taxation is that for all the profit a company earns shareholders who receive dividends keep as little as 40 cents on the dollar double taxation is bad for our economy double taxation is wrong double taxation falls especially hard on retired people about half of all dividend income goes to america's seniors and they often rely on those checks for a steady source of income in their retirement it's fair to tax a company's profits it's not fair to double tax by taxing the shareholder on the same profits so today for the good of our senior citizens and to support capital formation across the land i'm asking the united states congress to abolish the double taxation of dividends the benefits of this tax relief will be felt throughout the economy abolishing double taxation of dividends will leave nearly 35 million americans with more of their own money to spend and invest which will promote savings and return as much as 20 billion this year to the private economy by ending this investment penalty we will strengthen investor confidence see by ending double taxation of dividends we will increase the return on investing which will draw more money into the markets to provide capital to build factories to buy equipment hire more people we must also encourage the investments that help turn small businesses into larger ones small businesses create the majority of new jobs in america and they account for half the output of the economy currently tax law permits small firms to write off as expenses up to 25 000 worth of equipment like computers or machinery that they need i'm asking the congress to raise that limit to 75 000 and index that number for inflation this change together with the faster rate reductions will benefit more than 23 million small business owners my view is this economy can thrive only if our small businesses thrive and we will provide them every incentive to grow and create more jobs a third challenge facing our country is the need to help unemployed workers and prepare them for the new jobs of a growing economy the unemployment rate today is 6 percent that's low for an economy coming out of recession it's higher than it should be and the unemployment rate is projected to rise even further in the short run this hardship is concentrated in certain regions and in certain industries manufacturing jobs have declined for 28 months in a row you know what i'm talking about here in the midwest you're showing signs of recovery here yet many people here and across this country are still looking for work a woman in arkansas tells a typical story she talked about the fact that her husband was laid off from his job at a local steel mill and both she and the husband have been looking for a job for quite a while here's what she said there's just nothing for me to find we're trying to save up what little money we have and move to another community and look for jobs there got to be worried about those kind of stories here in america as we encourage long term growth we will not forget the men and women who are struggling today close to 70 000 workers each week exhaust their unemployment benefits and we have an obligation to help our fellow citizens so i'm asking this new congress to extend unemployment benefits that expired on december the 28th and the benefits congress approves should be retroactive like the fitzgerald bill so that people who lost their benefits last month can receive their benefits in full helping america's unemployed workers should be a first order of business in the new congress and it looks like it's going to be we must be more creative when we help those who have the hardest time finding work to encourage innovation and more choices and to help those who are out of work find the dignity of a new job today i'm unveiling a new approach to helping unemployed americans through personal reemployment accounts under this new program americans who face the greatest difficulties in finding work will receive up to 3 000 to use in their job search they will have great flexibility in how they use that money a person with a reemployment account will be able to decide whether to use the funds for job training or child care or transportation or even to cover the costs of relocating to another city for a new job if the job is obtained quickly'within 13 weeks'the worker will be able to keep the cash balance as a reemployment bonus as we see new economic growth we will need well trained workers to fill new jobs so i'm going to ask the congress to provide 3 6 billion to the states to pay for the reemployment accounts enough money to help more than a million unemployed men and women across america in order to strengthen this economy in the future we must help these americans today the jobs and growth proposals i've outlined today are a focused plan to encourage consumer spending to promote small business growth to boost confidence in our markets and to give critical help to unemployed citizens overall this growth package will reduce the tax burden of americans by 98 billion this year and 670 billion over the next decade i proposed a bold plan because the need for this plan is urgent and i urge the congress to act swiftly and pass this bill our nation has seen 2 years of serious and steady challenges the recession and the decline in the stock market slowed earnings and cut into tax revenues and created a budget deficit and in this time of war i can assure you this government is spending what is necessary to win the war but the congress must also understand this the american people deserve and expect spending discipline in washington dc with spending discipline and with progrowth policies we will expand the economy and help bring down this deficit this growth and jobs package is essential in the short run it's an immediate boost to the economy and these proposals will help stimulate investment and put more people back to work is what we want to have happen they are essential for the long run as well to lay the groundwork for future growth and future prosperity that growth will bring the added benefit of higher revenues for the government revenues that will keep tax rates low while fulfilling key obligations and protecting programs such as medicare and social security we're meeting the challenges to america we're strengthening our economy and we're taking a battle to our enemies and we're not going to leave our work half finished in the months ahead we'll confront every threat to the safety and security of the american people we'll press on to turn our recovery into lasting growth and opportunity that reaches every corner of america by the courage and by the enterprise of the american people this great nation will prosper and there's no doubt in my mind this great nation will prevail may god bless you all and may god bless america ,<nrclex.NRCLex

should be retroactive to January 1st.', ""Upon passage, I'll order the Treasury Department to immediately adjust the amount of money withheld for income taxes, so that Americans will keep more of their paychecks right away."", 'By speeding up the income-tax cuts, we will speed economic recovery and the pace of job creation.', 'If tax relief is good enough for Americans 3 years from now, it is good enough for Americans today.', 'An additional beneficiary of this tax cut will be small businesses.', 'About 30 million Americans include small-business income when they file their individual tax returns with the IRS.', 'Faster tax relief will help these businesses to expand sooner, to hire new people faster, and to build a stronger foundation for the recovery.', 'We also know that middle-income families need additional relief.', ""So today I'm asking Congress to speed up three other tax reductions promised in 2001, tax reductions that will help our middle-income families."", 'Instead of slowly reducing the marriage penalty until 2009, we should do it now, to help 35 million married couples.', 'Instead of waiting until 2008 to move more taxpayers from the 15-percent bracket to the lowest bracket of 10 percent, we should make that change now and help 2 million working Americans.', 'And instead of gradually raising the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child by the year of 2010, for the benefit of 26 million families, we should raise it now.', 'These tax reductions will bring real and immediate benefits to middle-income Americans.', 'Ninety-two million Americans will keep an average of $1,083 more of their own money.', 'A family of four with two earners and $39,000 in income will receive more than $1,100 in tax relief, real money to help pay the bills and push the economy forward.', 'And the sooner Congress acts, the sooner the help will come.', 'Taken together, these income-tax cuts will put an additional $70 billion to work in the private economy over the next 18 months.', ""And there's no better way to help our economy grow than to leave more money in the hands of the men and women who earned it."", 'Our second challenge is to encourage greater investment by individuals and small businesses, the kind of investing that builds personal wealth and helps company expand and creates new jobs.', 'We are increasingly a nation of owners, who invest for retirement and the other financial challenges of life.', 'One-half of American households own stock, either directly or through pension funds.', 'And we have an obligation to make sure, now more than ever, that American investors are treated fairly.', 'We can begin by treating investors fairly and equally in our tax laws.', 'As it is now, many investments are taxed not once but twice.', 'First, the IRS taxes a company on its profit.', 'Then it taxes the investors who receive the profits as dividends.', 'The result of this double taxation is that for all the profit a company earns, shareholders who receive dividends keep as little as 40 cents on the dollar.', 'Double taxation is bad for our economy.', 'Double taxation is wrong.', 'Double taxation falls especially hard on retired people.', ""About half of all dividend income goes to America's seniors, and they often rely on those checks for a steady source of income in their retirement."", ""It's fair to tax a company's profits."", ""It's not fair to double-tax by taxing the shareholder on the same profits."", ""So today, for the good of our senior citizens and to support capital formation across the land, I'm asking the United States Congress to abolish the double taxation of dividends."", 'The benefits of this tax relief will be felt throughout the economy.', 'Abolishing double taxation of dividends will leave nearly 35 million Americans with more of their own money to spend and invest, which will promote savings and return as much as $20 billion this year to the private economy.', 'By ending this investment penalty, we will strengthen investor confidence.', 'See, by ending double taxation of dividends, we will increase the return on investing, which will draw more money into the markets to provide capital to build factories, to buy equipment, hire more people.', 'We must also encourage the investments that help turn small businesses into larger ones.', 'Small businesses create the majority of new jobs in America, and they account for half the output of the economy.', 'Currently, tax law permits small firms to write off as expenses up to $25,000 worth of equipment, like computers or machinery that they need.', ""I'm asking the Congress to raise that limit to $75,000 and index that number for inflation."", 'This change, together with the faster rate reductions, will benefit more than 23 million small-business owners.', 'My view is this economy can thrive only if our small businesses thrive.', 'And we will provide them every incentive to grow and create more jobs.', 'A third challenge facing our country is the need to help unemployed workers and prepare them for the new jobs of a growing economy.', 'The unemployment rate today is 6 percent.', ""That's low for an economy coming out of recession."", ""It's higher than it should be, and the unemployment rate is projected to rise even further in the short run."", 'This hardship is concentrated in certain regions and in certain industries.', 'Manufacturing jobs have declined for 28 months in a row.', ""You know what I'm talking about here in the Midwest."", ""You're showing signs of recovery here; yet many people here and across this country are still looking for work."", 'A woman in Arkansas tells a typical story.', 'She talked about the fact that her husband was laid off from his job at a local steel mill.', 'And both she and the husband have been looking for a job for quite a while.', 'Here\'s what she said: ""There\'s just nothing for me to find.', 'We\'re trying to save up what little money we have and move to another community and look for jobs there.""', 'Got to be worried about those kind of stories here in America.', 'As we encourage long-term growth, we will not forget the men and women who are struggling today.', 'Close to 70,000 workers each week exhaust their unemployment benefits, and we have an obligation to help our fellow citizens.', ""So I'm asking this new Congress to extend unemployment benefits that expired on December the 28th."", 'And the benefits Congress approves should be retroactive, like the Fitzgerald bill, so that people who lost their benefits last month can receive their benefits in full.', ""Helping America's unemployed workers should be a first order of business in the new Congress, and it looks like it's going to be."", 'We must be more creative when we help those who have the hardest time finding work.', ""To encourage innovation and more choices and to help those who are out of work find the dignity of a new job, today I'm unveiling a new approach to helping unemployed Americans through Personal Reemployment Accounts."", 'Under this new program, Americans who face the greatest difficulties in finding work will receive up to $3,000 to use in their job search.', 'They will have great flexibility in how they use that money.', 'A person with a Reemployment Account will be able to decide whether to use the funds for job training or child care or transportation or even to cover the costs of relocating to another city for a new job.', 'If the job is obtained quickly— within 13 weeks—the worker will be able to keep the cash balance as a ""reemployment bonus.""', 'As we see new economic growth, we will need well-trained workers to fill new jobs.', ""So I'm going to ask the Congress to provide $3.6 billion to the States to pay for the Reemployment Accounts, enough money to help more than a million unemployed men and women across America."", 'In order to strengthen this economy in the future, we must help these Americans today.', ""The jobs-and-growth proposals I've outlined today are a focused plan to encourage consumer spending, to promote small-business growth, to boost confidence in our markets, and to give critical help to unemployed citizens."", 'Overall, this growth package will reduce the tax burden of Americans by $98 billion this year and $670 billion over the next decade.', 'I proposed a bold plan because the need for this plan is urgent, and I urge the Congress to act swiftly and pass this bill.', 'Our Nation has seen 2 years of serious and steady challenges.', 'The recession and the decline in the stock market slowed earnings and cut into tax revenues and created a budget deficit.', 'And in this time of war, I can assure you this Government is spending what is necessary to win the war.', 'But the Congress must also understand this: The American people deserve and expect spending discipline in Washington, DC.', 'With spending discipline and with progrowth policies, we will expand the economy and help bring down this deficit.', ""This growth-and-jobs package is essential in the short run; it's an immediate boost to the economy."", 'And these proposals will help stimulate investment and put more people back to work, is what we want to have happen.', 'They are essential for the long run as well, to lay the groundwork for future growth and future prosperity.', 'That growth will bring the added benefit of higher revenues for the Government, revenues that will keep tax rates low while fulfilling key obligations and protecting programs such as Medicare and Social Security.', ""We're meeting the challenges to America."", ""We're strengthening our economy, and we're taking a battle to our enemies."", ""And we're not going to leave our work half-finished."", ""In the months ahead, we'll confront every threat to the safety and security of the American people."", ""We'll press on to turn our recovery into lasting growth and opportunity that reaches every corner of America."", ""By the courage and by the enterprise of the American people, this great Nation will prosper, and there's no doubt in my mind this great Nation will prevail."", 'May God bless you all,

"To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation; With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest – a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night. To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia – I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you. Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story – of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to. It is that promise that has always set this country apart – that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well. That's why I stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women – students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive. We meet at one of those defining moments – a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more. Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush. America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this. This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news. We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes. Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land – enough! This moment – this election – is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: ""Eight is enough."" Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need. But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change. The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives – on health care and education and the economy – Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made ""great progress"" under this President. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisors – the man who wrote his economic plan – was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a ""mental recession,"" and that we've become, and I quote, ""a nation of whiners."" A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know. Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement? It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it. For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy – give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is – you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No health care? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps – even if you don't have boots. You're on your own. Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America. You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President – when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush. We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job – an economy that honors the dignity of work. The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great – a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight. Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships. When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well. I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States. What is that promise? It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect. It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road. Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves – protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology. Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work. That's the promise of America – the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper. That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President. Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it. Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow. I will cut taxes – cut taxes – for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class. And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East. Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office. Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close. As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy – wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced. America, now is not the time for small plans. Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American – if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education. Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most. Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent. Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations. And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons. Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime – by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less – because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy. And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our ""intellectual and moral strength."" Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need. Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility – that's the essence of America's promise. And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have. For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just ""muddle through"" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell – but he won't even go to the cave where he lives. And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war. That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past. You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice – but it is not the change we need. We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans – have built, and we are here to restore that legacy. As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home. I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future. These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain. But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism. The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America – they have served the United States of America. So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first. America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose – our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore. We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise – the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort. I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from. You make a big election about small things. And you know what – it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know. I get it. I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington. But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you. For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us – that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it – because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time. America, this is one of those moments. I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands. And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise. This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores. Instead, it is that American spirit – that American promise – that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend. That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours – a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot. And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream. The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred. But what the people heard instead – people of every creed and color, from every walk of life – is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one. ""We cannot walk alone,"" the preacher cried. ""And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back."" America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise – that American promise – and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess. Thank you, God Bless you, and and God Bless the United States of America.",address-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-democratic-national-convention-denver.txt,,,,,,,,,,,,,gwb,"['To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation; With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.', 'Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest – a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.', 'To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.', 'I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.', ""To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia – I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you."", ""Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story – of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to."", 'It is that promise that has always set this country apart – that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.', ""That's why I stand here tonight."", 'Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women – students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.', 'We meet at one of those defining moments – a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.', 'Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less.', 'More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.', ""More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach."", ""These challenges are not all of government's making."", 'But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W.

"This morning I spoke with FEMA Under Secretary Mike Brown and emergency management teams, not only at the Federal level but at the State level about the— Hurricane Katrina. I've also spoken to Governor Blanco of Louisiana, Governor Barbour of Mississippi, Governor Bush of Florida, and Governor Riley of Alabama. I want to thank all the folks at the Federal level and the State level and the local level who have taken this storm seriously. I appreciate the efforts of the Governors to prepare their citizenry for this upcoming storm. Yesterday I signed a disaster declaration for the State of Louisiana, and this morning I signed a disaster declaration for the State of Mississippi. These declarations will allow Federal agencies to coordinate all disaster relief efforts with State and local officials. We will do everything in our power to help the people in the communities affected by this storm. Hurricane Katrina is now designated a category 5 hurricane. We cannot stress enough the danger this hurricane poses to gulf coast communities. I urge all citizens to put their own safety and the safety of their families first by moving to safe ground. Please listen carefully to instructions provided by State and local officials. On another matter, today Iraqi political leaders completed the process for drafting a permanent constitution. Their example is an inspiration to all who share the universal values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. The negotiators and drafters of this document braved the intimidation of terrorists, and they mourn the cowardly assassination of friends and colleagues involved in the process of drafting the constitution. Their efforts follow the bravery of the Iraqis who voted by the millions to elect a Transitional Government in January. The example of those voters remains a humbling testament to the power of free people to shape and define their own destiny. We honor their courage and sacrifice, and we are determined to see the Iraqis fully secure their democratic gains. The Iraqi people have once again demonstrated to the world that they are up to the historic challenges before them. The document they have produced contains far-reaching protections for fundamental human freedoms, including religion, assembly, conscience, and expression. It vests sovereignty in the people, to be expressed by secret ballot and regular elections. It declares that all Iraqis are equal before the law without regard to gender, ethnicity, and religion. This is a document of which the Iraqis and the rest of the world can be proud. The political process now advances to another important stage for a new and free Iraq. In coming months, Iraqis will discuss and debate the draft constitution. On October the 15th, they will vote in a national referendum to decide whether to ratify the constitution and set the foundation for a permanent Iraqi Government. If the referendum succeeds, Iraqis will elect a new Government, to serve under the new constitution, on December the 15th, and that Government will take office before the end of the year. This course is going to be difficult largely because the terrorists have chosen to wage war against a future of freedom. They are waging war against peace in Iraq. As democracy in Iraq takes root, the enemies of freedom, the terrorists, will become more desperate, more despicable, and more vicious. Just last week, the terrorists called for the death of anyone, including women and the elderly, who supports the democratic process in Iraq. They have deliberately targeted children receiving candy from soldiers. They have targeted election workers registering Iraqis to vote. They have targeted hospital workers who are caring for the wounded. We can expect such atrocities to increase in the coming months because the enemy knows that its greatest defeat lies in the expression of free people and freely enacted laws and at the ballot box. We will stand with the Iraqi people. It's in our interest to stand with the Iraqi people. It's in our interest to lay the foundation of peace. We'll help them confront this barbarism, and we will triumph over the terrorists' dark ideology of hatred and fear. There have been disagreements amongst the Iraqis about this particular constitution. Of course there's disagreements. We're watching a political process unfold, a process that has encouraged debate and compromise, a constitution that was written in a society in which people recognize that— that there had to be give-and-take. I want our folks to remember, our own Constitution was not unanimously received. Some delegates at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 refused to sign it, and the draft was vigorously debated in every State, and the outcome was not assured until all the votes were counted. We recognize that there's a split amongst the Sunnis, for example, in Iraq. And I suspect that when you get down to it, you'll find a Shi'a who disagrees with the constitution and Shi'as who support the constitution and perhaps some Kurds who are concerned about the constitution. In other words, we're watching a political process unfold. Some Sunnis have expressed reservations about various provisions of the constitution, and that's their right as free individuals living in a free society. There are strong beliefs among other Sunnis that this constitution is good for all Iraqis and that it adequately reflects compromises suitable to all groups. It's important that all Iraqis now actively engage in the constitutional process by debating the merits of this important document and making an informed decision on October the 15th. On behalf of the American people, I congratulate the people of Iraq on completing the next step in their transition from dictatorship to democracy. And I want to remind the American people, as a democracy unfolds in Iraq, not only will it help make America more secure but it will affect the broader Middle East. Democracies don't war with their neighbors. Democracies don't become safe haven for terrorists who want to destroy innocent life. We have hard work ahead of us, but we're on the—we're making good progress toward making sure this world of ours is more peaceful for generations to come.

emergency management teams, not only at the Federal level but at the State level about the— Hurricane Katrina.', ""I've also spoken to Governor Blanco of Louisiana, Governor Barbour of Mississippi, Governor Bush of Florida, and Governor Riley of Alabama."", 'I want to thank all the folks at the Federal level and the State level and the local level who have taken this storm seriously.', 'I appreciate the efforts of the Governors to prepare their citizenry for this upcoming storm.', 'Yesterday I signed a disaster declaration for the State of Louisiana, and this morning I signed a disaster declaration for the State of Mississippi.', 'These declarations will allow Federal agencies to coordinate all disaster relief efforts with State and local officials.', 'We will do everything in our power to help the people in the communities affected by this storm.', 'Hurricane Katrina is now designated a category 5 hurricane.', 'We cannot stress enough the danger this hurricane poses to gulf coast communities.', 'I urge all citizens to put their own safety and the safety of their families first by moving to safe ground.', 'Please listen carefully to instructions provided by State and local officials.', 'On another matter, today Iraqi political leaders completed the process for drafting a permanent constitution.', 'Their example is an inspiration to all who share the universal values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.', 'The negotiators and drafters of this document braved the intimidation of terrorists, and they mourn the cowardly assassination of friends and colleagues involved in the process of drafting the constitution.', 'Their efforts follow the bravery of the Iraqis who voted by the millions to elect a Transitional Government in January.', 'The example of those voters remains a humbling testament to the power of free people to shape and define their own destiny.', 'We honor their courage and sacrifice, and we are determined to see the Iraqis fully secure their democratic gains.', 'The Iraqi people have once again demonstrated to the world that they are up to the historic challenges before them.', 'The document they have produced contains far-reaching protections for fundamental human freedoms, including religion, assembly, conscience, and expression.', 'It vests sovereignty in the people, to be expressed by secret ballot and regular elections.', 'It declares that all Iraqis are equal before the law without regard to gender, ethnicity, and religion.', 'This is a document of which the Iraqis and the rest of the world can be proud.', 'The political process now advances to another important stage for a new and free Iraq.', 'In coming months, Iraqis will discuss and debate the draft constitution.', 'On October the 15th, they will vote in a national referendum to decide whether to ratify the constitution and set the foundation for a permanent Iraqi Government.', 'If the referendum succeeds, Iraqis will elect a new Government, to serve under the new constitution, on December the 15th, and that Government will take office before the end of the year.', 'This course is going to be difficult largely because the terrorists have chosen to wage war against a future of freedom.', 'They are waging war against peace in Iraq.', 'As democracy in Iraq takes root, the enemies of freedom, the terrorists, will become more desperate, more despicable, and more vicious.', 'Just last week, the terrorists called for the death of anyone, including women and the elderly, who supports the democratic process in Iraq.', 'They have deliberately targeted children receiving candy from soldiers.', 'They have targeted election workers registering Iraqis to vote.', 'They have targeted hospital workers who are caring for the wounded.', 'We can expect such atrocities to increase in the coming months because the enemy knows that its greatest defeat lies in the expression of free people and freely enacted laws and at the ballot box.', 'We will stand with the Iraqi people.', ""It's in our interest to stand with the Iraqi people."", ""It's in our interest to lay the foundation of peace."", ""We'll help them confront this barbarism, and we will triumph over the terrorists' dark ideology of hatred and fear."", 'There have been disagreements amongst the Iraqis about this particular constitution.', ""Of course there's disagreements."", ""We're watching a political process unfold, a process that has encouraged debate and compromise, a constitution that was written in a society in which people recognize that— that there had to be give-and-take."", 'I want our folks to remember, our own Constitution was not unanimously received.', 'Some delegates at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 refused to sign it, and the draft was vigorously debated in every State, and the outcome was not assured until all the votes were counted.', ""We recognize that there's a split amongst the Sunnis, for example, in Iraq."", ""And I suspect that when you get down to it, you'll find a Shi'a who disagrees with the constitution and Shi'as who support the constitution and perhaps some Kurds who are concerned about the constitution."", ""In other words, we're watching a political process unfold."", ""Some Sunnis have expressed reservations about various provisions of the constitution, and that's their right as free individuals living in a free society."", 'There are strong beliefs among other Sunnis that this constitution is good for all Iraqis and that it adequately reflects compromises suitable to all groups.', ""It's important that all Iraqis now actively engage in the constitutional process by debating the merits of this important document and making an informed decision on October the 15th."", 'On behalf of the American people, I congratulate the people of Iraq on completing the next step in their transition from dictatorship to democracy.', 'And I want to remind the American people, as a democracy unfolds in Iraq, not only will it help make America more secure but it will affect the broader Middle East.', ""Democracies don't war with their neighbors."", ""Democracies don't become safe haven for terrorists who want to destroy innocent life."", ""We have hard work ahead of us, but we're on the—we're making good progress toward making sure this world of ours is more peaceful for generations to come."", 'Thank you very much.']","['This', 'morning', 'I', 'spoke', 'with', 'FEMA', 'Under', 'Secretary', 'Mike', 'Brown', 'and', 'emergency', 'management', 'teams', ',', 'not',

"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tempore, Members of Congress, and fellow Americans: In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this Chamber to report on the state of the Union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already been delivered by the American people. We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground, passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer. And would you please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight.  We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working past exhaustion. We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own. My fellow citizens, for the last 9 days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of our Union, and it is strong. Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America was touched, on the evening of the tragedy, to see Republicans and Democrats joined together on the steps of this Capitol, singing ""God Bless America."" And you did more than sing; you acted, by delivering $40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our military. Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle, and Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship, for your leadership, and for your service to our country. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its outpouring of support. America will never forget the sounds of our national anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris, and at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our Embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo. We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America. Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own: dozens of Pakistanis; more than 130 Israelis; more than 250 citizens of India; men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico, and Japan; and hundreds of British citizens. America has no truer friend than Great Britain. Once again, we are joined together in a great cause—so honored the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity with America. Thank you for coming, friend. On September 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country. Americans have known wars, but for the past 136 years, they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known the casualties of war, but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning. Americans have known surprise attacks, but never before on thousands of civilians. All of this was brought upon us in a single day, and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack. Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking, who attacked our country? The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as Al Qaida. They are some of the murderers indicted for bombing American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya and responsible for bombing the U.S.S. Cole. Al Qaida is to terror what the Mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making money. Its goal is remaking the world and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere. The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics, a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children. This group and its leader, a person named Usama bin Laden, are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries. They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction. The leadership of Al Qaida has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan, we see Al Qaida's vision for the world. Afghanistan's people have been brutalized. Many are starving, and many have fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can be jailed for owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough. The United States respects the people of Afghanistan—after all, we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid—but we condemn the Taliban regime. It is not only repressing its own people; it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and abetting murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder. And tonight the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban: Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of Al Qaida who hide in your land. Release all foreign nationals, including American citizens, you have unjustly imprisoned. Protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and aid workers in your country. Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist and every person in their support structure to appropriate authorities. Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating. These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate. I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world. We respect your faith. It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans and by millions more in countries that America counts as friends. Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself. The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them. Our war on terror begins with Al Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated. Americans are asking, why do they hate us? They hate what we see right here in this Chamber, a democratically elected government. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedoms—our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other. They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East. They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa. These terrorists kill not merely to end lives but to disrupt and end a way of life. With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our friends. They stand against us, because we stand in their way. We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before. They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions, by abandoning every value except the will to power, they follow in the path of fascism and nazism and totalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends, in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies. Americans are asking, how will we fight and win this war? We will direct every resource at our command—every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of war—to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network. This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion. It will not look like the air war above Kosovo 2 years ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat. Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. Americans should not expect one battle but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make: Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime. Our Nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack. We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans. Today dozens of Federal departments and agencies, as well as State and local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security. These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So tonight I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me, the Office of Homeland Security. And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort to strengthen American security, a military veteran, an effective Governor, a true patriot, a trusted friend, Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge. He will lead, oversee, and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and respond to any attacks that may come. These measures are essential. But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows. Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks, and all have our prayers. And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a message for our military: Be ready. I've called the Armed Forces to alert, and there is a reason. The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make us proud. This is not, however, just America's fight, and what is at stake is not just America's freedom. This is the world's fight. This is civilization's fight. This is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom. We ask every nation to join us. We will ask, and we will need, the help of police forces, intelligence services, and banking systems around the world. The United States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded with sympathy and with support, nations from Latin America to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the Islamic world. Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best the attitude of the world: An attack on one is an attack on all. The civilized world is rallying to America's side. They understand that if this terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next. Terror, unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments. And you know what? We're not going to allow it. Americans are asking, what is expected of us? I ask you to live your lives and hug your children. I know many citizens have fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat. I ask you to uphold the values of America and remember why so many have come here. We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith. I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source of information, libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it. I ask for your patience with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security and for your patience in what will be a long struggle. I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy. Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch its source. America is successful because of the hard work and creativity and enterprise of our people. These were the true strengths of our economy before September 11th, and they are our strengths today. And finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those in uniform, and for our great country. Prayer has comforted us in sorrow and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead. Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their representatives, for what you have already done and for what we will do together. Tonight we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights and take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying, with direct assistance during this emergency. We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home. We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities, to know the plans of terrorists before they act and find them before they strike. We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America's economy and put our people back to work. Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers, Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress and these two leaders to show the world that we will rebuild New York City. After all that has just passed, all the lives taken and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them, it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear. Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead and dangers to face. But this country will define our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world. Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief and anger, we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war. The advance of human freedom, the great achievement of our time and the great hope of every time, now depends on us. Our Nation—this generation—will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage. We will not tire; we will not falter; and we will not fail. It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to normal. We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good. Even grief recedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened. We'll remember the moment the news came, where we were, and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this: It is the police shield of a man named George 
Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end. I will not forget this wound to our country and those who inflicted it. I will not yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people. The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral between them. Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice, assured of the rightness of our cause and confident of the victories to come. In all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of America. Thank you.

events presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the union tonight no such report is needed it has already been delivered by the american people we have seen it in the courage of passengers who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground passengers like an exceptional man named todd beamer and would you please help me to welcome his wife lisa beamer here tonight we have seen the state of our union in the endurance of rescuers working past exhaustion we have seen the unfurling of flags the lighting of candles the giving of blood the saying of prayers in english hebrew and arabic we have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own my fellow citizens for the last 9 days the entire world has seen for itself the state of our union and it is strong tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom our grief has turned to anger and anger to resolution whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies justice will be done i thank the congress for its leadership at such an important time all of america was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see republicans and democrats joined together on the steps of this capitol singing god bless america and you did more than sing you acted by delivering 40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our military speaker hastert minority leader gephardt majority leader daschle and senator lott i thank you for your friendship for your leadership and for your service to our country and on behalf of the american people i thank the world for its outpouring of support america will never forget the sounds of our national anthem playing at buckingham palace on the streets of paris and at berlin's brandenburg gate we will not forget south korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in seoul or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in cairo we will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in australia and africa and latin america nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own dozens of pakistanis more than 130 israelis more than 250 citizens of india men and women from el salvador iran mexico and japan and hundreds of british citizens america has no truer friend than great britain once again we are joined together in a great cause'so honored the british prime minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity with america thank you for coming friend on september 11th enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country americans have known wars but for the past 136 years they have been wars on foreign soil except for one sunday in 1941 americans have known the casualties of war but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning americans have known surprise attacks but never before on thousands of civilians all of this was brought upon us in a single day and night fell on a different world a world where freedom itself is under attack americans have many questions tonight americans are asking who attacked our country the evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al qaida they are some of the murderers indicted for bombing american embassies in tanzania and kenya and responsible for bombing the u s s cole al qaida is to terror what the mafia is to crime but its goal is not making money its goal is remaking the world and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere the terrorists practice a fringe form of islamic extremism that has been rejected by muslim scholars and the vast majority of muslim clerics a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of islam the terrorists' directive commands them to kill christians and jews to kill all americans and make no distinctions among military and civilians including women and children this group and its leader a person named usama bin laden are linked to many other organizations in different countries including the egyptian islamic jihad and the islamic movement of uzbekistan there are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries they are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like afghanistan where they are trained in the tactics of terror they are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction the leadership of al qaida has great influence in afghanistan and supports the taliban regime in controlling most of that country in afghanistan we see al qaida's vision for the world afghanistan's people have been brutalized many are starving and many have fled women are not allowed to attend school you can be jailed for owning a television religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate a man can be jailed in afghanistan if his beard is not long enough the united states respects the people of afghanistan'after all we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid'but we condemn the taliban regime it is not only repressing its own people it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists by aiding and abetting murder the taliban regime is committing murder and tonight the united states of america makes the following demands on the taliban deliver to united states authorities all the leaders of al qaida who hide in your land release all foreign nationals including american citizens you have unjustly imprisoned protect foreign journalists diplomats and aid workers in your country close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in afghanistan and hand over every terrorist and every person in their support structure to appropriate authorities give the united states full access to terrorist training camps so we can make sure they are no longer operating these demands are not open to negotiation or discussion the taliban must act and act immediately they will hand over the terrorists or they will share in their fate i also want to speak tonight directly to muslims throughout the world we respect your faith it's practiced freely by many millions of americans and by millions more in countries that america counts as friends its teachings are good and peaceful and those who commit evil in the name of allah blaspheme the name of allah the terrorists are traitors to their own faith trying in effect to hijack islam itself the enemy of america is not our many muslim friends it is not our many arab friends our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them our war on terror begins with al qaida but it does not end there it will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found stopped and defeated americans are asking why do they hate us they hate what we see right here in this chamber a democratically elected government their leaders are self appointed they hate our freedoms'our freedom of religion our freedom of speech our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other they want to overthrow existing governments in many muslim countries such as egypt saudi arabia and jordan they want to drive israel out of the middle east they want to drive christians and jews out of vast regions of asia and africa these terrorists kill not merely to end lives but to disrupt and end a way of life with every atrocity they hope that america grows fearful retreating from the world and forsaking our friends they stand against us because we stand in their way we are not deceived by their pretenses to piety we have seen their kind before they are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century by sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions by abandoning every value except the will to power they follow in the path of fascism and nazism and totalitarianism and they will follow that path all the way to where it ends in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies americans are asking how will we fight and win this war we will direct every resource at our command'every means of diplomacy every tool of intelligence every instrument of law enforcement every financial influence and every necessary weapon of war'to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network this war will not be like the war against iraq a decade ago with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion it will not look like the air war above kosovo 2 years ago where no ground troops were used and not a single american was lost in combat our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes americans should not expect one battle but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen it may include dramatic strikes visible on tv and covert operations secret even in success we will starve terrorists of funding turn them one against another drive them from place to place until there is no refuge or no rest and we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists from this day forward any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the united states as a hostile regime our nation has been put on notice we are not immune from attack we will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect americans today dozens of federal departments and agencies as well as state and local governments have responsibilities affecting homeland security these efforts must be coordinated at the highest level so tonight i announce the creation of a cabinet level position reporting directly to me the office of homeland security and tonight i also announce a distinguished american to lead this effort to strengthen american security a military veteran an effective governor a true patriot a trusted friend pennsylvania's tom ridge he will lead oversee and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and respond to any attacks that may come these measures are essential but the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it eliminate it and destroy it where it grows many will be involved in this effort from fbi agents to intelligence operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty all deserve our thanks and all have our prayers and tonight a few miles from the damaged pentagon i have a message for our military be ready i've called the armed forces to alert and there is a reason the hour is coming when america will act and you will make us proud this is not however just america's fight and what is at stake is not just america's freedom this is the world's fight this is civilization's fight this is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism tolerance and freedom we ask every nation to join us we will ask and we will need the help of police forces intelligence services and banking systems around the world the united states is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded with sympathy and with support nations from latin america to asia to africa to europe to the islamic world perhaps the nato charter reflects best the attitude of the world an attack on one is an attack on all the civilized world is rallying to america's side they understand that if this terror goes unpunished their own cities their own citizens may be next terror unanswered can not only bring down buildings it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments and you know what we're not going to allow it americans are asking what is expected of us i ask you to live your lives and hug your children i know many citizens have fears tonight and i ask you to be calm and resolute even in the face of a continuing threat i ask you to uphold the values of america and remember why so many have come here we are in a fight for our principles and our first responsibility is to live by them no one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith i ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions those who want to give can go to a central source of information libertyunites org to find the names of groups providing direct help in new york pennsylvania and virginia the thousands of fbi agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation and i ask you to give it i ask for your patience with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security and for your patience in what will be a long struggle i ask your continued participation and confidence in the american economy terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work and creativity and enterprise of our people these were the true strengths of our economy before september 11th and they are our strengths today and finally please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families for those in uniform and for our great country prayer has comforted us in sorrow and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead tonight i thank my fellow americans for what you have already done and for what you will do and ladies and gentlemen of the congress i thank you their representatives for what you have already done and for what we will do together tonight we face new and sudden national challenges we will come together to improve air safety to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights and take new measures to prevent hijacking we will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying with direct assistance during this emergency we will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home we will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act and find them before they strike we will come together to take active steps that strengthen america's economy and put our people back to work tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all new yorkers governor george pataki and mayor rudolph giuliani as a symbol of america's resolve my administration will work with congress and these two leaders to show the world that we will rebuild new york city after all that has just

to show his unity with America.', 'Thank you for coming, friend.', 'On September 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country.', 'Americans have known wars, but for the past 136 years, they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941.', 'Americans have known the casualties of war, but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning.', 'Americans have known surprise attacks, but never before on thousands of civilians.', 'All of this was brought upon us in a single day, and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack.', 'Americans have many questions tonight.', 'Americans are asking, who attacked our country?', 'The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as Al Qaida.', 'They are some of the murderers indicted for bombing American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya and responsible for bombing the U.S.S.', 'Cole.', 'Al Qaida is to terror what the Mafia is to crime.', 'But its goal is not making money.', 'Its goal is remaking the world and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere.', 'The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics, a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam.', ""The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children."", 'This group and its leader, a person named Usama bin Laden, are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.', 'There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries.', 'They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror.', 'They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction.', 'The leadership of Al Qaida has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country.', ""In Afghanistan, we see Al Qaida's vision for the world."", ""Afghanistan's people have been brutalized."", 'Many are starving, and many have fled.', 'Women are not allowed to attend school.', 'You can be jailed for owning a television.', 'Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate.', 'A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough.', 'The United States respects the people of Afghanistan—after all, we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid—but we condemn the Taliban regime.', 'It is not only repressing its own people; it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists.', 'By aiding and abetting murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder.', 'And tonight the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban: Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of Al Qaida who hide in your land.', 'Release all foreign nationals, including American citizens, you have unjustly imprisoned.', 'Protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and aid workers in your country.', 'Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist and every person in their support structure to appropriate authorities.', 'Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating.', 'These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion.', 'The Taliban must act and act immediately.', 'They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.', 'I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world.', 'We respect your faith.', ""It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans and by millions more in countries that America counts as friends."", 'Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah.', 'The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself.', 'The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends.', 'Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.', 'Our war on terror begins with Al Qaida, but it does not end there.', 'It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.', 'Americans are asking, why do they hate us?', 'They hate what we see right here in this Chamber, a democratically elected government.', 'Their leaders are self-appointed.', 'They hate our freedoms—our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.', 'They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan.', 'They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East.', 'They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa.', 'These terrorists kill not merely to end lives but to disrupt and end a way of life.', 'With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our friends.', 'They stand against us, because we stand in their way.', 'We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety.', 'We have seen their kind before.', 'They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century.', 'By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions, by abandoning every value except the will to power, they follow in the path of fascism and nazism and totalitarianism.', ""And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends, in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies."", 'Americans are asking, how will we fight and win this war?', 'We will direct every resource at our command—every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of war—to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.', 'This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion.', 'It will not look like the air war above Kosovo 2 years ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat.', 'Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes.', 'Americans should not expect one battle but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen.', 'It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success.', 'We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest.', 'And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism.', 'Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make: Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.', 'From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.', 'Our Nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack.', 'We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans.', 'Today dozens of Federal departments and agencies, as well as State and local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security.', 'These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level.', 'So tonight I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me, the Office of Homeland Security.', ""And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort to strengthen American security, a military veteran, an effective Governor, a true patriot, a trusted friend, Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge."", 'He will lead, oversee, and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and respond to any attacks that may come.', 'These measures are essential.', 'But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows.', 'Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty.', 'All deserve our thanks, and all have our prayers.', 'And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a message for our military: Be ready.', ""I've called the Armed Forces to alert, and there is a reason."", 'The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make us proud.', ""This is not, however, just America's fight, and what is at stake is not just America's freedom."", ""This is the world's fight."", ""This is civilization's fight."", 'This is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom.', 'We ask every nation to join us.', 'We will ask, and we will need, the help of police forces, intelligence services, and banking systems around the world.', 'The United States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded with sympathy and with support, nations from Latin America to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the Islamic world.', 'Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best the attitude of the world: An attack on one is an attack on all.', ""The civilized world is rallying to America's side."", 'They understand that if this terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next.', 'Terror, unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments.', 'And you know what?', ""We're not going to allow it."", 'Americans are asking, what is expected of us?', 'I ask you to live your lives and hug your children.', 'I know many citizens have fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat.', 'I ask you to uphold the values of America and remember why so many have come here.', 'We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by them.', 'No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith.', 'I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions.', 'Those who want to give can go to a central source of information, libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.', 'The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it.', 'I ask for your patience with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security and for your patience in what will be a long struggle.', 'I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy.', 'Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity.', 'They did not touch its source.', 'America is successful because of the hard work and creativity and enterprise of our people.', 'These were the true strengths of our economy before September 11th, and they are our strengths today.', 'And finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those in uniform, and for our great country.', 'Prayer has comforted us in sorrow and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead.', 'Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will do.', 'And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their representatives, for what you have already done and for what we will do together.', 'Tonight we face new and sudden national challenges.', 'We will come together to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights and take new measures to prevent hijacking.', 'We will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying, with direct assistance during this emergency.', 'We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home.', 'We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities, to know the plans of terrorists before they act and find them before they strike.', ""We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America's economy and put our people back to work."", 'Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers, Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.', ""As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress and these two leaders to show the world that we will rebuild New York City."", ""After all that has just passed, all the lives taken and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them, it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear."", 'Some speak of an age of terror.', 'I know there are struggles ahead and dangers to face.', 'But this country will define our times, not be defined by them.', 'As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.', 'Great harm has been done to us.', 'We have suffered great loss.', 'And in our grief and anger, we have found our mission and our moment.', 'Freedom and fear are at war.', 'The advance of human freedom, the great achievement of our time and the great hope of every time, now depends on us.', 'Our Nation—this generation—will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future.', 'We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage.', 'We will not tire; we will not falter; and we will not fail.', 'It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to normal.', ""We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good."", 'Even grief recedes with time and grace.', 'But our resolve must not pass.', 'Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened.', ""We'll remember the moment the news came, where we were, and what we were doing."", 'Some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue.', 'Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.', 'And I will carry this: It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others.', 'It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son.', 'It is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end.', 'I will not forget this wound to our country and those who inflicted it.', 'I will not yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people.', 'The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain.', 'Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral between them.', ""Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice, assured of the rightness of our cause and confident of the victories to come."", 'In all that lies before us, may God grant

"Today I signed into law a bill that will allow Federal courts to hear a claim by or on behalf of Terri Schiavo for violation of her rights relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her life. In cases like this one, where there are serious questions and substantial doubts, our society, our laws, and our courts should have a presumption in favor of life. This presumption is especially critical for those like Terri Schiavo who live at the mercy of others. I appreciate the bipartisan action by the Members of Congress to pass this bill.

"Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans: the privilege of accepting our party's nomination for president of the United States.  Thank you. Thanks. And I accept it with... Thank you. I -- and I accept it with gratitude, humility, and confidence. In my life, no success has come without a good fight, and this nomination wasn't any different. That's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. They're leaders of great ability who love our country and wish to lead it to better days. Their support is an honor that I won't forget. I'm grateful to the president of the United States for leading us in these dark days following the worst attack in American history.  The worst attack on American soil in our history and keeping us safe from another attack that many -- many thought was inevitable. And to the first lady... And to the first lady, Laura Bush, a model of grace and kindness in public and in private.  And I'm grateful to the 41st president and his bride of 63 years for their outstanding example...... for their outstanding example of honorable service to our country. As always, I'm indebted to my wife, Cindy, and my seven children. You know, the pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation's business. But I have treasured them all the more and can't imagine a life without the happiness that you've given me. You know, Cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight. But, in truth, she's more my inspiration than I am hers.  Her concern for those less blessed than we are -- victims of land mines, children born in poverty, with birth defects -- shows the measure of her humanity. And I know that she will make a great first lady.  My friends, when I was growing up, my father was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and me would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of life, her deep interest in the world, her strength, and her belief that we're all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country. I wouldn't be here tonight but for the strength of her character.  And she doesn't want me to say this, but she's 96 years young. My heartfelt thanks to all of you who helped me win this nomination and stood by me when the odds were long. I won't let you down.  I won't let you down. I won't let you down.  To Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust. I intend to earn it.  And, finally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it -- we'll go at it over the next two months -- you know that's the nature of this business -- and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and my admiration. Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow Americans, and that's an association that means more to me than any other.  We're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our creator with inalienable rights. No country – no country ever had a greater cause than that. And I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement. But let there be no doubt, my friends: We're going to win this election.  And after we've won, we're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government start working for you again, and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace.  I know these are tough times for many of you. You're worried about... Please, please, please. My friends, my dear friends, please. Please don't be diverted by the ground noise and the static.  You know, I'm going to talk about it some more. But Americans want us to stop yelling at each other, OK?  These are tough times for many of you. You're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, and you're struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home.  All you've ever asked of your government is to stand on your side and not in your way. And that's what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for your future.  And I've found just the right partner to help me shake up Washington, Governor Sarah... Governor Sarah Palin of the great state of Alaska.  And I want to thank everyone here and all over America for the tremendous, wonderful, warm reception you gave her last night. Thank you so much. She deserves it. What a great beginning. You know, she has an executive experience and a real record of accomplishment. She's tackled tough problems, like energy independence and corruption. She's balanced a budget, cut taxes, and she's taken on the special interests.  She's reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, Democrats, and independents to serve in her administration. She's the wonderful mother of five children.  She's -- she's helped run a small business. She's worked with her hands and knows -- and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments, and health care, and the cost of gasoline and groceries. She knows where she comes from, and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down.  I'm very proud to have introduced our next vice president to the country, but I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington.  And let me just offer an advance warning to the old, big- spending, do-nothing, me-first, country-second crowd: Change is coming.  I'm not -- I'm not in the habit of breaking my promises to my country, and neither is Governor Palin. And when we tell you we're going to change Washington and stop leaving our country's problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count on it. And we've... We've got a record of doing just that, and the strength, experience, judgment, and backbone to keep our word to you.  You well know I've been called a maverick, someone who......someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes it's meant as a compliment; sometimes it's not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you.  I've fought corruption, and it didn't matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They violated their public trust, and they had to be held accountable. I've fought the big spenders... I've fought the big spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither need nor want, and the first big-spending pork-barrel earmark bill that comes across my desk, I will veto it. I will make them famous, and you will know their names. You will know their names.  We're not going to allow that while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank, and make your mortgage payment. I've fought to get million-dollar checks out of our elections. I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes. I've fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I've fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses.  I've fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq when it wasn't the popular thing to do.  And when the pundits said -- when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war.  And thanks -- thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general, David Petraeus, and the brave men and women he has the honor to command......that -- that strategy succeeded, and it rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military, risked a wider war, and threatened the security of all Americans.  I don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life. But I learned an important lesson along the way: In the end, it matters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test.  I fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost......lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills. I fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake... Jake works on a loading dock, coaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her master's degree. They have two sons. The youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. Their lives should matter to the people they elect to office. And they matter to me. And they matter to you. I fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire.  Matthew died serving our country in Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to honor their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to remains safe from its enemies.  I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost -- we lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost their trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it bigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties -- and Senator Obama – passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their trust when we valued our power over our principles. We're going to change that.  We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again to the values Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics.  In this country, we believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential, from the boy whose descendants arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children, and we're all Americans.  We believe -- we believe in low taxes, spending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work and risk-takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor. We believe... We believe -- we believe in a strong defense, work, faith, service, a culture of life......personal responsibility, the rule of law, and judges who dispense justice impartially and don't legislate from the bench.  We believe in the values of families, neighborhoods, and communities. We believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans, government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself.  I will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open... I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them.  I will cut government spending. He will increase it.  My tax cuts will create jobs; his tax increases will eliminate them.  My health care plan will make it easier for more Americans to find and keep good health care insurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages, and force families into a government-run health care system where a bureaucrat......where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.  We all know that keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second-highest business tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and keep jobs from going overseas.  Doubling the child tax exemption from $3,500 to $7,000 will improve the lives of millions of American families.  Reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save, spend, and invest as you see fit.  Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity. I know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy, and it often sees that your government hasn't even noticed. Government assistance for the unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch.  Now, my opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back find a new one that won't go away.  We will prepare them for the jobs of day -- of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities.  For workers in industries -- for workers in industries that have been hard-hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one, while they receive re-training that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage.  Education -- education is the civil rights issue of this century.  Equal access to public education has been gained, but what is the value of access to a failing school? We need... We need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents with choice.  Let's remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and reward good teachers, and help bad teachers find another line of work.  When a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parent-- when it fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children. And I intend to give it to them.  Some may choose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will choose a charter school. But they will have the choice, and their children will have that opportunity.  Senator Obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucrats. I want schools to answer to parents and students.  And when I'm president, they will.  My fellow Americans, when I'm president, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades. We're going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much, and some of that money... We'll attack -- we'll attack the problem on every front. We'll produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells off-shore, and we'll drill them now. We'll drill them now.  We'll -- we'll -- my friends, we'll build more nuclear power plants. We'll develop clean-coal technology. We'll increase the use of wind, tide, solar, and natural gas. We'll encourage the development and use of flex-fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles.  Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power. But Americans know better than that.  We must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and restore the health of our planet. My friends......it's an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by nature, and we've faced greater challenges. It's time for us to show the world again how Americans lead.  This great national cause will create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity, jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce. Today -- today, the prospect of a better world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them as Americans before us did: with confidence, wisdom, and resolve. We have dealt... We have dealt a serious blow to Al Qaeda in recent years, but they're not defeated, and they'll strike us again, if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and is on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia's leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world's oil supply, intimidate other neighbors, and further their ambitions of re-assembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of Georgia need our solidarity and our prayers.  As president, I'll work to establish good relations with Russia so that we need not fear a return to the Cold War. But we can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people. We face many dangerous threats in this dangerous world, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm prepared for them.  I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better, and what it shouldn't do. I know h
ow the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't.  I know how to secure the peace. My friends, when I was 5 years old, a car pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the window and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It's terrible beyond imagination. I'm running for president to keep the country I love safe and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal -- diplomatic, economic, military, and the power of our ideals -- to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace.  In America, we change things that need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our greatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us; we don't need to search for it. We need to change the way government does almost everything: from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children. All these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy, the information technology revolution, and the end of the Cold War. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do business in Washington.  The -- the constant partisan rancor that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause. It's a symptom. It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not for you.  Again and again -- again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as president. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. My friends......I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.  Instead -- instead of rejecting good ideas because we didn't think of them first, let's use the best ideas from both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let's try sharing it. This amazing country... This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I'll ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability. We're... We're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won't care who gets the credit. My friends, I've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. But I've been her servant first, last, and always. And I've never... I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank God for the privilege.  Long ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes and I witnessed a thousand acts of courage, and compassion, and love. On an October morning, in the Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I hadn't any worry I wouldn't come back safe and sound. I thought I was tougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too.  I liked to bend a few rules and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for my own pleasure, my own pride. I didn't think there was a cause that was more important than me. Then I found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken arms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me.  I was dumped in a dark cell and left to die. I didn't feel so tough anymore. When they discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. They couldn't set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. And when I didn't get better and was down to about a hundred pounds, they put me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life.  I was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went home, they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners. Our code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and there were men who had been shot down long before me. I thought about it, though. I wasn't in great shape, and I missed everything about America, but I turned it down. A lot of prisoners had it much worse... A lot of -- a lot of prisoners had it a lot worse than I did. I'd been mistreated before, but not as badly as many others. I always liked to strut a little after I'd been roughed up to show the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned down their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before, for a long time, and they broke me. When they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door to me, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall, he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for my country and for the men I had the honor to serve with, because every day they fought for me.  I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency, for its faith in the wisdom, justice, and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again; I wasn't my own man anymore; I was my country's.  I'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need.  My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God.  My friends, if you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist... Enlist in our Armed Forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public office. Feed a hungry child. Teach an -- an illiterate adult to read. Comfort the afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be the better, and you will be the happier, because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself.  I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank him, that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on Earth. And with hard work -- with hard word, strong faith, and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me.  Fight for what's right for our country. Fight for the ideals and character of a free people.  Fight for our children's future. Fight for justice and opportunity for all.  Stand up to defend our country from its enemies. Stand up for each other, for beautiful, blessed, bountiful America.  Stand up, stand up, stand up, and fight.  Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans, and we never give up.  We never quit.  We never hide from history. We make history.  Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless America.

"Good evening. Tonight in Iraq, the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged in a struggle that will determine the direction of the global war on terror and our safety here at home. The new strategy I outline tonight will change America's course in Iraq and help us succeed in the fight against terror. When I addressed you just over a year ago, nearly 12 million Iraqis had cast their ballots for a unified and democratic nation. The elections of 2005 were a stunning achievement. We thought that these elections would bring the Iraqis together and that as we trained Iraqi security forces, we could accomplish our mission with fewer American troops. But in 2006, the opposite happened. The violence in Iraq, particularly in Baghdad, overwhelmed the political gains the Iraqis had made. Al Qaida terrorists and Sunni insurgents recognized the mortal danger that Iraq's elections posed for their cause, and they responded with outrageous acts of murder aimed at innocent Iraqis. They blew up one of the holiest shrines in Shi'a Islam, the Golden Mosque of Samarra, in a calculated effort to provoke Iraq's Shi'a population to retaliate. Their strategy worked. Radical Shi'a elements, some supported by Iran, formed death squads. And the result was a vicious cycle of sectarian violence that continues today. The situation in Iraq is unacceptable to the American people, and it is unacceptable to me. Our troops in Iraq have fought bravely. They have done everything we have asked them to do. Where mistakes have been made, the responsibility rests with me. It is clear that we need to change our strategy in Iraq. So my national security team, military commanders, and diplomats conducted a comprehensive review. We consulted Members of Congress from both parties, our allies abroad, and distinguished outside experts. We benefited from the thoughtful recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel led by former Secretary of State James Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton. In our discussions, we all agreed that there is no magic formula for success in Iraq. And one message came through loud and clear: Failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the United States. The consequences of failure are clear. Radical Islamic extremists would grow in strength and gain new recruits. They would be in a better position to topple moderate governments, create chaos in the region, and use oil revenues to fund their ambitions. Iran would be emboldened in its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Our enemies would have a safe haven from which to plan and launch attacks on the American people. On September the 11th, 2001, we saw what a refuge for extremists on the other side of the world could bring to the streets of our own cities. For the safety of our people, America must succeed in Iraq. The most urgent priority for success in Iraq is security, especially in Baghdad. Eighty percent of Iraq's sectarian violence occurs within 30 miles of the capital. This violence is splitting Baghdad into sectarian enclaves and shaking the confidence of all Iraqis. Only Iraqis can end the sectarian violence and secure their people, and their Government has put forward an aggressive plan to do it. Our past efforts to secure Baghdad failed for two principal reasons: There were not enough Iraqi and American troops to secure neighborhoods that had been cleared of terrorists and insurgents, and there were too many restrictions on the troops we did have. Our military commanders reviewed the new Iraqi plan to ensure that it addressed these mistakes. They report that it does. They also report that this plan can work. Now, let me explain the main elements of this effort. The Iraqi Government will appoint a military commander and two deputy commanders for their capital. The Iraqi Government will deploy Iraqi Army and National Police brigades across Baghdad's nine districts. When these forces are fully deployed, there will be 18 Iraqi Army and National Police brigades committed to this effort, along with local police. These Iraqi forces will operate from local police stations, conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints and going door to door to gain the trust of Baghdad residents. This is a strong commitment, but for it to succeed, our commanders say the Iraqis will need our help. So America will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of Baghdad. This will require increasing American force levels. So I've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq. The vast majority of them, five brigades, will be deployed to Baghdad. These troops will work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded in their formations. Our troops will have a well-defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods, to help them protect the local population, and to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security that Baghdad needs. Many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure Baghdad did not. Well, here are the differences. In earlier operations, Iraqi and American forces cleared many neighborhoods of terrorists and insurgents, but when our forces moved on to other targets, the killers returned. This time we'll have the force levels we need to hold the areas that have been cleared. In earlier operations, political and sectarian interference prevented Iraqi and American forces from going into neighborhoods that are home to those fueling the sectarian violence. This time Iraqi and American forces will have a green light to enter those neighborhoods, and Prime Minister Maliki has pledged that political or sectarian interference will not be tolerated. I have made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi Government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people, and it will lose the support of the Iraqi people. Now is the time to act. The Prime Minister understands this. Here is what he told his people just last week: ""The Baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of their sectarian or political affiliation."" This new strategy will not yield an immediate end to suicide bombings, assassinations, or IED attacks. Our enemies in Iraq will make every effort to ensure that our television screens are filled with images of death and suffering. Yet over time, we can expect to see Iraqi troops chasing down murderers, fewer brazen acts of terror, and growing trust and cooperation from Baghdad's residents. When this happens, daily life will improve, Iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders, and the Government will have the breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas. Most of Iraq's Sunni and Shi'a want to live together in peace, and reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make reconciliation possible. A successful strategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations. Ordinary Iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities. So America will hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced. To establish its authority, the Iraqi Government plans to take responsibility for security in all of Iraq's Provinces by November. To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis. To show that it is committed to delivering a better life, the Iraqi Government will spend $10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will create new jobs. To empower local leaders, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later this year. And to allow more Iraqis to reenter their nation's political life, the Government will reform de-Ba'athification laws and establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's Constitution. America will change our approach to help the Iraqi Government as it works to meet these benchmarks. In keeping with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, we will increase the embedding of American advisers in Iraqi Army units and partner a coalition brigade with every Iraqi Army division. We will help the Iraqis build a larger and better equipped army, and we will accelerate the training of Iraqi forces, which remains the essential U.S. security mission in Iraq. We will give our commanders and civilians greater flexibility to spend funds for economic assistance. We will double the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams. These teams bring together military and civilian experts to help local Iraqi communities pursue reconciliation, strengthen the moderates, and speed the transition to Iraqi self-reliance. And Secretary Rice will soon appoint a reconstruction coordinator in Baghdad to ensure better results for economic assistance being spent in Iraq. As we make these changes, we will continue to pursue Al Qaida and foreign fighters. Al Qaida is still active in Iraq. Its home base is Anbar Province. Al Qaida has helped make Anbar the most violent area of Iraq outside the capital. A captured Al Qaida document describes the terrorists' plan to infiltrate and seize control of the Province. This would bring Al Qaida closer to its goals of taking down Iraq's democracy, building a radical Islamic empire, and launching new attacks on the United States, at home and abroad. Our military forces in Anbar are killing and capturing Al Qaida leaders, and they are protecting the local population. Recently, local tribal leaders have begun to show their willingness to take on Al Qaida. And as a result, our commanders believe we have an opportunity to deal a serious blow to the terrorists. So I have given orders to increase American forces in Anbar Province by 4,000 troops. These troops will work with Iraqi and tribal forces to keep up the pressure on the terrorists. America's men and women in uniform took away Al Qaida's safe haven in Afghanistan, and we will not allow them to reestablish it in Iraq. Succeeding in Iraq also requires defending its territorial integrity and stabilizing the region in the face of extremist challenges. This begins with addressing Iran and Syria. These two regimes are allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their territory to move in and out of Iraq. Iran is providing material support for attacks on American troops. We will disrupt the attacks on our forces. We'll interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria, and we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq. We're also taking other steps to bolster the security of Iraq and protect American interests in the Middle East. I recently ordered the deployment of an additional carrier strike group to the region. We will expand intelligence sharing and deploy Patriot air defense systems to reassure our friends and allies. We will work with the Governments of Turkey and Iraq to help them resolve problems along their border. And we will work with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating the region. We will use America's full diplomatic resources to rally support for Iraq from nations throughout the Middle East. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf States need to understand that an American defeat in Iraq would create a new sanctuary for extremists and a strategic threat to their survival. These nations have a stake in a successful Iraq that is at peace with its neighbors, and they must step up their support for Iraq's unity Government. We endorse the Iraqi Government's call to finalize an international compact that will bring new economic assistance in exchange for greater economic reform. And on Friday, Secretary Rice will leave for the region to build support for Iraq and continue the urgent diplomacy required to help bring peace to the Middle East. The challenge playing out across the broader Middle East is more than a military conflict. It is the decisive ideological struggle of our time. On one side are those who believe in freedom and moderation; on the other side are extremists who kill the innocent and have declared their intention to destroy our way of life. In the long run, the most realistic way to protect the American people is to provide a hopeful alternative to the hateful ideology of the enemy by advancing liberty across a troubled region. It is in the interests of the United States to stand with the brave men and women who are risking their lives to claim their freedom and to help them as they work to raise up just and hopeful societies across the Middle East. From Afghanistan to Lebanon to the Palestinian Territories, millions of ordinary people are sick of the violence and want a future of peace and opportunity for their children. And they are looking at Iraq. They want to know: Will America withdraw and yield the future of that country to the extremists, or will we stand with the Iraqis who have made the choice for freedom? The changes I have outlined tonight are aimed at ensuring the survival of a young democracy that is fighting for its life in a part of the world of enormous importance to American security. Let me be clear: The terrorists and insurgents in Iraq are without conscience, and they will make the year ahead bloody and violent. Even if our new strategy works exactly as planned, deadly acts of violence will continue, and we must expect more Iraqi and American casualties. The question is whether our new strategy will bring us closer to success. I believe that it will. Victory will not look like the ones our fathers and grandfathers achieved. There will be no surrender ceremony on the deck of a battleship. But victory in Iraq will bring something new in the Arab world: a functioning democracy that polices its territory, upholds the rule of law, respects fundamental human liberties, and answers to its people. A democratic Iraq will not be perfect, but it will be a country that fights terrorists instead of harboring them, and it will help bring a future of peace and security for our children and our grandchildren. This new approach comes after consultations with Congress about the different courses we could take in Iraq. Many are concerned that the Iraqis are becoming too dependent on the United States, and therefore, our policy should focus on protecting Iraq's borders and hunting down Al Qaida. Their solution is to scale back America's efforts in Baghdad or announce the phased withdrawal of our combat forces. We carefully considered these proposals, and we concluded that to step back now would force a collapse of the Iraqi Government, tear the country apart, and result in mass killings on an unimaginable scale. Such a scenario would result in our troops being forced to stay in Iraq even longer and confront an enemy that is even more lethal. If we increase our support at this crucial moment and help the Iraqis break the current cycle of violence, we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home. In the days ahead, my national security team will fully brief Congress on our new strategy. If Members have improvements that can be made, we will make them. If circumstances change, we will adjust. Honorable people have different views, and they will voice their criticisms. It is fair to hold our views up to scrutiny. And all involved have a responsibility to explain how the path they propose would be more likely to succeed. Acting on the good advice of Senator Joe Lieberman and other key Members of Congress, we will form a new, bipartisan working group that will help us come together across party lines to win the war on terror. This group will meet regularly with me and my administration; it will help strengthen our relationship with Congress. We can begin by working together to increase the size of the active Army and Marine Corps, so that America has the Armed Forces we need for the 21st century. We also need to examine ways to mobilize talented American civilians to deploy overseas, where they can help build democratic institutions in communities and nations recovering from war and tyranny. In these dangerous times, the United States is blessed to have extraordinary and selfless men and women willing to step forward and defend us. These young Americans understand that our cause in Iraq is noble and necessary and that the advance of freedom is the calling of our time. They serve far from their families, who make the quiet sacrifices of lonely holidays and empty chairs at the dinner table. They have watched their comrades give their lives to ensure our liberty. We mourn the loss of every fallen American, and we owe it to them to build a future worthy of their sacrifice. Fellow citizens, the year ahead will demand more patience, sacrifice, and resolve. It can be tempting to think that America can put aside the burdens of freedom. Yet times of testing reveal the character of a nation, and throughout our history, Americans have always defied the pessimists and seen our faith in freedom redeemed. Now America is engaged in a new struggle that will set the course for a new century. We can and we will prevail. We go forward with trust that the Author of Liberty will guide us through these trying hours. Thank you and good night.",address-the-nation-military-operations-iraq.txt,12,good evening tonight in iraq the armed forces of the united states are engaged in a struggle that will determine the direction of the global war on terror and our safety here at home the new strategy i outline tonight will change america's course in iraq and help us succeed in the fight against terror when i addressed you just over a year ago nearly 12 million iraqis had cast their ballots for a unified and democratic nation the elections of 2005 were a stunning achievement we thought that these elections would bring the iraqis together and that as we trained iraqi security forces we could accomplish our mission with fewer american troops but in 2006 the opposite happened the violence in iraq particularly in baghdad overwhelmed the political gains the iraqis had made al qaida terrorists and sunni insurgents recognized the mortal danger that iraq's elections posed for their cause and they responded with outrageous acts of murder aimed at innocent iraqis they blew up one of the holiest shrines in shi'a islam the golden mosque of samarra in a calculated effort to provoke iraq's shi'a population to retaliate their strategy worked radical shi'a elements some supported by iran formed death squads and the result was a vicious cycle of sectarian violence that continues today the situation in iraq is unacceptable to the american people and it is unacceptable to me our troops in iraq have fought bravely they have done everything we have asked them to do where mistakes have been made the responsibility rests with me it is clear that we need to change our strategy in iraq so my national security team military commanders and diplomats conducted a comprehensive review we consulted members of congress from both parties our allies abroad and distinguished outside experts we benefited from the thoughtful recommendations of the iraq study group a bipartisan panel led by former secretary of state james baker and former congressman lee hamilton in our discussions we all agreed that there is no magic formula for success in iraq and one message came through loud and clear failure in iraq would be a disaster for the united states the consequences of failure are clear radical islamic extremists would grow in strength and gain new recruits they would be in a better position to topple moderate governments create chaos in the region and use oil revenues to fund their ambitions iran would be emboldened in its pursuit of nuclear weapons our enemies would have a safe haven from which to plan and launch attacks on the american people on september the 11th 2001 we saw what a refuge for extremists on the other side of the world could bring to the streets of our own cities for the safety of our people america must succeed in iraq the most urgent priority for success in iraq is security especially in baghdad eighty percent of iraq's sectarian violence occurs within 30 miles of the capital this violence is splitting baghdad into sectarian enclaves and shaking the confidence of all iraqis only iraqis can end the sectarian violence and secure their people and their government has put forward an aggressive plan to do it our past efforts to secure baghdad failed for two principal reasons there were not enough iraqi and american troops to secure neighborhoods that had been cleared of terrorists and insurgents and there were too many restrictions on the troops we did have our military commanders reviewed the new iraqi plan to ensure that it addressed these mistakes they report that it does they also report that this plan can work now let me explain the main elements of this effort the iraqi government will appoint a military commander and two deputy commanders for their capital the iraqi government will deploy iraqi army and national police brigades across baghdad's nine districts when these forces are fully deployed there will be 18 iraqi army and national police brigades committed to this effort along with local police these iraqi forces will operate from local police stations conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints and going door to door to gain the trust of baghdad residents this is a strong commitment but for it to succeed our commanders say the iraqis will need our help so america will change our strategy to help the iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of baghdad this will require increasing american force levels so i've committed more than 20 000 additional american troops to iraq the vast majority of them five brigades will be deployed to baghdad these troops will work alongside iraqi units and be embedded in their formations our troops will have a well defined mission to help iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods to help them protect the local population and to help ensure that the iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security that baghdad needs many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure baghdad did not well here are the differences in earlier operations iraqi and american forces cleared many neighborhoods of terrorists and insurgents but when our forces moved on to other targets the killers returned this time we'll have the force levels we need to hold the areas that have been cleared in earlier operations political and sectarian interference prevented iraqi and american forces from going into neighborhoods that are home to those fueling the sectarian violence this time iraqi and american forces will have a green light to enter those neighborhoods and prime minister maliki has pledged that political or sectarian interference will not be tolerated i have made it clear to the prime minister and iraq's other leaders that america's commitment is not open ended if the iraqi government does not follow through on its promises it will lose the support of the american people and it will lose the support of the iraqi people now is the time to act the prime minister understands this here is what he told his people just last week the baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaws regardless of their sectarian or political affiliation this new strategy will not yield an immediate end to suicide bombings assassinations or ied attacks our enemies in iraq will make every effort to ensure that our television screens are filled with images of death and suffering yet over time we can expect to see iraqi troops chasing down murderers fewer brazen acts of terror and growing trust and cooperation from baghdad's residents when this happens daily life will improve iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders and the government will have the breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas most of iraq's sunni and shi'a want to live together in peace and reducing the violence in baghdad will help make reconciliation possible a successful strategy for iraq goes beyond military operations ordinary iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities so america will hold the iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced to establish its authority the iraqi government plans to take responsibility for security in all of iraq's provinces by november to give every iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all iraqis to show that it is committed to delivering a better life the iraqi government will spend 10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will create new jobs to empower local leaders iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later this year and to allow more iraqis to reenter their nation's political life the government will reform de ba'athification laws and establish a fair process for considering amendments to iraq's constitution america will change our approach to help the iraqi government as it works to meet these benchmarks in keeping with the recommendations of the iraq study group we will increase the embedding of american advisers in iraqi army units and partner a coalition brigade with every iraqi army division we will help the iraqis build a larger and better equipped army and we will accelerate the training of iraqi forces which remains the essential u s security mission in iraq we will give our commanders and civilians greater flexibility to spend funds for economic assistance we will double the number of provincial reconstruction teams these teams bring together military and civilian experts to help local iraqi communities pursue reconciliation strengthen the moderates and speed the transition to iraqi self reliance and secretary rice will soon appoint a reconstruction coordinator in baghdad to ensure better results for economic assistance being spent in iraq as we make these changes we will continue to pursue al qaida and foreign fighters al qaida is still active in iraq its home base is anbar province al qaida has helped make anbar the most violent area of iraq outside the capital a captured al qaida document describes the terrorists' plan to infiltrate and seize control of the province this would bring al qaida closer to its goals of taking down iraq's democracy building a radical islamic empire and launching new attacks on the united states at home and abroad our military forces in anbar are killing and capturing al qaida leaders and they are protecting the local population recently local tribal leaders have begun to show their willingness to take on al qaida and as a result our commanders believe we have an opportunity to deal a serious blow to the terrorists so i have given orders to increase american forces in anbar province by 4 000 troops these troops will work with iraqi and tribal forces to keep up the pressure on the terrorists america's men and women in uniform took away al qaida's safe haven in afghanistan and we will not allow them to reestablish it in iraq succeeding in iraq also requires defending its territorial integrity and stabilizing the region in the face of extremist challenges this begins with addressing iran and syria these two regimes are allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their territory to move in and out of iraq iran is providing material support for attacks on american troops we will disrupt the attacks on our forces we'll interrupt the flow of support from iran and syria and we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in iraq we're also taking other steps to bolster the security of iraq and protect american interests in the middle east i recently ordered the deployment of an additional carrier strike group to the region we will expand intelligence sharing and deploy patriot air defense systems to reassure our friends and allies we will work with the governments of turkey and iraq to help them resolve problems along their border and we will work with others to prevent iran from gaining

Armed Forces of the United States are engaged in a struggle that will determine the direction of the global war on terror and our safety here at home.', ""The new strategy I outline tonight will change America's course in Iraq and help us succeed in the fight against terror."", 'When I addressed you just over a year ago, nearly 12 million Iraqis had cast their ballots for a unified and democratic nation.', 'The elections of 2005 were a stunning achievement.', 'We thought that these elections would bring the Iraqis together and that as we trained Iraqi security forces, we could accomplish our mission with fewer American troops.', 'But in 2006, the opposite happened.', 'The violence in Iraq, particularly in Baghdad, overwhelmed the political gains the Iraqis had made.', ""Al Qaida terrorists and Sunni insurgents recognized the mortal danger that Iraq's elections posed for their cause, and they responded with outrageous acts of murder aimed at innocent Iraqis."", ""They blew up one of the holiest shrines in Shi'a Islam, the Golden Mosque of Samarra, in a calculated effort to provoke Iraq's Shi'a population to retaliate."", 'Their strategy worked.', ""Radical Shi'a elements, some supported by Iran, formed death squads."", 'And the result was a vicious cycle of sectarian violence that continues today.', 'The situation in Iraq is unacceptable to the American people, and it is unacceptable to me.', 'Our troops in Iraq have fought bravely.', 'They have done everything we have asked them to do.', 'Where mistakes have been made, the responsibility rests with me.', 'It is clear that we need to change our strategy in Iraq.', 'So my national security team, military commanders, and diplomats conducted a comprehensive review.', 'We consulted Members of Congress from both parties, our allies abroad, and distinguished outside experts.', 'We benefited from the thoughtful recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel led by former Secretary of State James Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton.', 'In our discussions, we all agreed that there is no magic formula for success in Iraq.', 'And one message came through loud and clear: Failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the United States.', 'The consequences of failure are clear.', 'Radical Islamic extremists would grow in strength and gain new recruits.', 'They would be in a better position to topple moderate governments, create chaos in the region, and use oil revenues to fund their ambitions.', 'Iran would be emboldened in its pursuit of nuclear weapons.', 'Our enemies would have a safe haven from which to plan and launch attacks on the American people.', 'On September the 11th, 2001, we saw what a refuge for extremists on the other side of the world could bring to the streets of our own cities.', 'For the safety of our people, America must succeed in Iraq.', 'The most urgent priority for success in Iraq is security, especially in Baghdad.', ""Eighty percent of Iraq's sectarian violence occurs within 30 miles of the capital."", 'This violence is splitting Baghdad into sectarian enclaves and shaking the confidence of all Iraqis.', 'Only Iraqis can end the sectarian violence and secure their people, and their Government has put forward an aggressive plan to do it.', 'Our past efforts to secure Baghdad failed for two principal reasons: There were not enough Iraqi and American troops to secure neighborhoods that had been cleared of terrorists and insurgents, and there were too many restrictions on the troops we did have.', 'Our military commanders reviewed the new Iraqi plan to ensure that it addressed these mistakes.', 'They report that it does.', 'They also report that this plan can work.', 'Now, let me explain the main elements of this effort.', 'The Iraqi Government will appoint a military commander and two deputy commanders for their capital.', ""The Iraqi Government will deploy Iraqi Army and National Police brigades across Baghdad's nine districts."", 'When these forces are fully deployed, there will be 18 Iraqi Army and National Police brigades committed to this effort, along with local police.', 'These Iraqi forces will operate from local police stations, conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints and going door to door to gain the trust of Baghdad residents.', 'This is a strong commitment, but for it to succeed, our commanders say the Iraqis will need our help.', 'So America will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of Baghdad.', 'This will require increasing American force levels.', ""So I've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq."", 'The vast majority of them, five brigades, will be deployed to Baghdad.', 'These troops will work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded in their formations.', 'Our troops will have a well-defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods, to help them protect the local population, and to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security that Baghdad needs.', 'Many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure Baghdad did not.', 'Well, here are the differences.', 'In earlier operations, Iraqi and American forces cleared many neighborhoods of terrorists and insurgents, but when our forces moved on to other targets, the killers returned.', ""This time we'll have the force levels we need to hold the areas that have been cleared."", 'In earlier operations, political and sectarian interference prevented Iraqi and American forces from going into neighborhoods that are home to those fueling the sectarian violence.', 'This time Iraqi and American forces will have a green light to enter those neighborhoods, and Prime Minister Maliki has pledged that political or sectarian interference will not be tolerated.', ""I have made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended."", 'If the Iraqi Government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people, and it will lose the support of the Iraqi people.', 'Now is the time to act.', 'The Prime Minister understands this.', 'Here is what he told his people just last week: ""The Baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of their sectarian or political affiliation.""', 'This new strategy will not yield an immediate end to suicide bombings, assassinations, or IED attacks.', 'Our enemies in Iraq will make every effort to ensure that our television screens are filled with images of death and suffering.', ""Yet over time, we can expect to see Iraqi troops chasing down murderers, fewer brazen acts of terror, and growing trust and cooperation from Baghdad's residents."", 'When this happens, daily life will improve, Iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders, and the Government will have the breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas.', ""Most of Iraq's Sunni and Shi'a want to live together in peace, and reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make reconciliation possible."", 'A successful strategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations.', 'Ordinary Iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities.', 'So America will hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced.', ""To establish its authority, the Iraqi Government plans to take responsibility for security in all of Iraq's Provinces by November."", ""To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis."", 'To show that it is committed to delivering a better life, the Iraqi Government will spend $10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will create new jobs.', 'To empower local leaders, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later this year.', ""And to allow more Iraqis to reenter their nation's political life, the Government will reform de-Ba'athification laws and establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's Constitution."", 'America will change our approach to help the Iraqi Government as it works to meet these benchmarks.', 'In keeping with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, we will increase the embedding of American advisers in Iraqi Army units and partner a coalition brigade with every Iraqi Army division.', 'We will help the Iraqis build a larger and better equipped army, and we will accelerate the training of Iraqi forces, which remains the essential U.S. security mission in Iraq.', 'We will give our commanders and civilians greater flexibility to spend funds for economic assistance.', 'We will double the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams.', 'These teams bring together military and civilian experts to help local Iraqi communities pursue reconciliation, strengthen the moderates, and speed the transition to Iraqi self-reliance.', 'And Secretary Rice will soon appoint a reconstruction coordinator in Baghdad to ensure better results for economic assistance being spent in Iraq.', 'As we make these changes, we will continue to pursue Al Qaida and foreign fighters.', 'Al Qaida is still active in Iraq.', 'Its home base is Anbar Province.', 'Al Qaida has helped make Anbar the most violent area of Iraq outside the capital.', ""A captured Al Qaida document describes the terrorists' plan to infiltrate and seize control of the Province."", ""This would bring Al Qaida closer to its goals of taking down Iraq's democracy, building a radical Islamic empire, and launching new attacks on the United States, at home and abroad."", 'Our military forces in Anbar are killing and capturing Al Qaida leaders, and they are protecting the local population.', 'Recently, local tribal leaders have begun to show their willingness to take on Al Qaida.', 'And as a result, our commanders believe we have an opportunity to deal a serious blow to the terrorists.', 'So I have given orders to increase American forces in Anbar Province by 4,000 troops.', 'These troops will work with Iraqi and tribal forces to keep up the pressure on the terrorists.', ""America's men and women in uniform took away Al Qaida's safe haven in Afghanistan, and we will not allow them to reestablish it in Iraq."", 'Succeeding in Iraq also requires defending its territorial integrity and stabilizing the region in the face of extremist challenges.', 'This begins with addressing Iran and Syria.', 'These two regimes are allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their territory to move in and out of Iraq.', 'Iran is providing material support for attacks on American troops.', 'We will disrupt the attacks on our forces.', ""We'll interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria, and we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq."", ""We're also taking other steps to bolster the security of Iraq and protect American interests in the Middle East."", 'I recently ordered the deployment of an additional carrier strike group to the region.', 'We will expand intelligence sharing and deploy Patriot air defense systems to reassure our friends and allies.', 'We will work with the Governments of Turkey and Iraq to help them resolve problems along their border.', 'And we will work with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating the region.', ""We will use America's full diplomatic resources to rally support for Iraq from nations throughout the Middle East."", 'Countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf States need to understand that an American defeat in Iraq would create a new sanctuary for extremists and a strategic threat to their survival.', ""These nations have a stake in a successful Iraq that is at peace with its neighbors, and they must step up their support for Iraq's unity Government."", ""We endorse the Iraqi Government's call to finalize an international compact that will bring new economic assistance in exchange for greater economic reform."", 'And on Friday, Secretary Rice will leave for the region to build support for Iraq and continue the urgent diplomacy required to help bring peace to the Middle East.', 'The challenge playing out across the broader Middle East is more than a military conflict.', 'It is the decisive ideological struggle of our time.', 'On one side are those who believe in freedom and moderation; on the other side are extremists who kill the innocent and have declared their intention to destroy our way of life.', 'In the long run, the most realistic way to protect the American people is to provide a hopeful alternative to the hateful ideology of the enemy by advancing liberty across a troubled region.', 'It is in the interests of the United States to stand with the brave men and women who are risking their lives to claim their freedom and to help them as they work to raise up just and hopeful societies across the Middle East.', 'From Afghanistan to Lebanon to the Palestinian Territories, millions of ordinary people are sick of the violence and want a future of peace and opportunity for their children.', 'And they are looking at Iraq.', 'They want to know: Will America withdraw and yield the future of that country to the extremists, or will we stand with the Iraqis who have made the choice for freedom?', 'The changes I have outlined tonight are aimed at ensuring the survival of a young democracy that is fighting for its life in a part of the world of enormous importance to American security.', 'Let me be clear: The terrorists and insurgents in Iraq are without conscience, and they will make the year ahead bloody and violent.', 'Even if our new strategy works exactly as planned, deadly acts of violence will continue, and we must expect more Iraqi and American casualties.', 'The question is whether our new strategy will bring us closer to success.', 'I believe that it will.', 'Victory will not look like the ones our fathers and grandfathers achieved.', 'There will be no surrender ceremony on the deck of a battleship.', 'But victory in Iraq will bring something new in the Arab world: a functioning democracy that polices its territory, upholds the rule of law, respects fundamental human liberties, and answers to its people.', 'A democratic Iraq will not be perfect, but it will be a country that fights terrorists instead of harboring them, and it will help bring a future of peace and security for our children and our grandchildren.', 'This new approach comes after consultations with Congress about the different courses we could take in Iraq.', ""Many are concerned that the Iraqis are becoming too dependent on the United States, and therefore, our policy should focus on protecting Iraq's borders and hunting down Al Qaida."", ""Their solution is to scale back America's efforts in Baghdad or announce the phased withdrawal of our combat forces."", 'We carefully considered these proposals, and we concluded that to step back now would force a collapse of the Iraqi Government, tear the country apart, and result in mass killings on an unimaginable scale.', 'Such a scenario would result in our troops being forced to stay in Iraq even longer and confront an enemy that is even more lethal.', 'If we increase our support at this crucial moment and help the Iraqis break the current cycle of violence, we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home.', 'In the days ahead, my national security team will fully brief Congress on our new strategy.', 'If Members have improvements that can be made, we will make them.', 'If circumstances change, we will adjust.', 'Honorable people have different views, and they will voice their criticisms.', 'It is fair to hold our views up to scrutiny.', 'And all involved have a responsibility to explain how the path they propose would be more likely to succeed.', 'Acting on the good advice of Senator Joe Lieberman and other key Members of Congress, we will form a new, bipartisan working group that will help us come together across party lines to win the war on terror.', 'This group will meet regularly with me and my administration; it will help strengthen our relationship with Congress.', 'We can begin by working together to increase the size of the active Army and Marine Corps, so that America has the Armed Forces we need for the 21st century.', 'We also need to examine ways to mobilize talented American civilians to deploy overseas, where they can help build democratic institutions in communities and nations recovering from war and tyranny.', 'In these dangerous times, the United States is blessed to have extraordinary and selfless men and women willing to step forward and defend us.', 'These young Americans understand that our cause in Iraq is noble and necessary and that the advance of freedom is the calling of our time.', 'They serve far from their families, who make the quiet sacrifices of lonely holidays and empty chairs at the dinner table.', 'They have watched their comrades give their lives to ensure our liberty.', 'We mourn the loss of every fallen American, and we owe it to them to build a future worthy of their sacrifice.', 'Fellow citizens, the year ahead will demand more patience, sacrifice, and resolve.', 'It can be tempting to think that America can put aside the burdens of freedom.', 'Yet times of testing reveal the character of a nation, and throughout our history, Americans have always defied the pessimists and seen our faith in freedom redeemed.', 'Now America is engaged in a new struggle that will set the course for a new century.', 'We can and we will prevail.', 'We go forward with trust that the Author of Liberty will guide us through these trying hours.', 'Thank you and good night.']","['Good', 'evening.', 'Tonight', 'in', 'Iraq', ',', 'the', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'of', 'the', 'United', 'States', 'are',

"Death of Theresa Marie Schiavo Today millions of Americans are saddened by the death of Terri Schiavo. Laura and I extend our condolences to Terri Schiavo's families. I appreciate the example of grace and dignity they have displayed at a difficult time. I urge all those who honor Terri Schiavo to continue to work to build a culture of life, where all Americans are welcomed and valued and protected, especially those who live at the mercy of others. The essence of civilization is that the strong have a duty to protect the weak. In cases where there are serious doubts and questions, the presumption should be in the favor of life. Intelligence Capabilities The most solemn duty of the American President is to protect the American people. Since September the 11th, 2001, we've taken bold and vigorous steps to prevent further attacks and overcome emerging threats. We face a new and different kind of enemy. The threats today are unprecedented. The lives of our citizens are at stake. To protect them, we need the best intelligence possible, and we must stay ahead of constantly changing intelligence challenges. So last year I issued an Executive order creating an independent Commission to look at America's intelligence capabilities, especially our intelligence about weapons of mass destruction. I asked two fine Americans to chair this Commission, Judge Laurence Silberman and former Senator Chuck Robb. They have done an excellent job. I appreciate your service to our country. I also want to thank the other members of the Commission, Senator John McCain, Rick Levin, Harry Rowen, Walt Slocombe, Bill Studeman, Judge Patricia Wald, Chuck Vest, and Lloyd Cutler. I want to thank them for their hard work. They spent a lot of time on this project. I asked these distinguished individuals to give me an unvarnished look at our intelligence community, and they have delivered. This morning the Commission presented me with their recommendations, which are thoughtful and extremely significant. The central conclusion is one that I share: America's intelligence community needs fundamental change to enable us to successfully confront the threats of the 21st century. My administration has taken steps consistent with the Commission's recommendations. In February, I named John Negroponte the first Director of National Intelligence, a post that was created to help ensure that our intelligence community works as a single, unified enterprise. It's important for Congress to move quickly on John's confirmation, because he'll have a key role in the continued reform and restructuring of intelligence capabilities. Today I've directed Homeland Secretary Adviser Fran Townsend to oversee the interagency process, to review the Commission's findings, and to ensure that concrete action is taken. The Commission report delivers a sharp critique of the way intelligence has been collected and analyzed against some of the most difficult intelligence targets, especially Iraq. To win the war on terror, we will correct what needs to be fixed and build on what the Commission calls solid intelligence successes. These include the uncovering of Libya's nuclear and missile programs. In Pakistan, our intelligence helped expose and shut down the world's most dangerous nuclear proliferation network. Where we have had success, the Commission reports we have seen innovative collection techniques and a fusion of interagency intelligence capabilities. We must work to replicate these successes in other areas. The men and women of our intelligence community work hard, and the sacrifices they have made have helped protect America. And our Nation is grateful for their hard work. The work they're doing is critical. We need to prevent terrorists from getting their hands on the weapons of mass murder they would like to use against our citizens. The work of our intelligence community is extremely difficult work. Every day, dangerous regimes are working to prevent us from uncovering their programs and their possible relationships with terrorists. And the work our intelligence men and women do is, by nature, secret, which is why the American people never hear about many of their successes. I'm proud of the efforts of our intelligence workers, and I'm proud of their commitment to the security of our country. And the American people should be proud too. And that's why this report is important. It will enable these fine men and women to do their jobs in better fashion, to be able to more likely accomplish their mission, which is to protect the American people. And that's why I'm grateful to the Commission for this hard work. The President and his national security team must have intelligence that is timely and intelligence that is accurate. In their report today, the Commission points out that America needs to know much more about the weapons programs and intentions of our most dangerous adversaries. They have given us useful and important guidance that will help us transform our intelligence capabilities for the needs of a dangerous new century. In other words, we need to adjust. We need to understand the threats and adjust our capabilities to meet those threats. We will work to give our intelligence professionals the tools they need. Our collection and analysis of intelligence will never be perfect, but in an age where our margin for error is getting smaller, in an age in which we are at war, the consequences of underestimating a threat could be tens of thousands of innocent lives. And my administration will continue to make intelligence reforms that will allow us to identify threats before they fully emerge so we can take effective action to protect the American people. I'm grateful for your hard work. And now the Chairman of the Commission and the Cochairman of the Commission have agreed to answer your questions.",remarks-prior-briefing-the-findings-the-commission-the-intelligence-capabilities-the.txt,42,death of theresa marie schiavo today millions of americans are saddened by the death of terri

"President Bush. There will be two opening statements this morning. Mr. Prime Minister, welcome. I want to thank you for the constructive visit we just had. We discussed a wide range of subjects. We discussed our economic relations. And I noted that the Vietnamese economy is growing quite substantially. We talked about our desire for Vietnam to join the WTO. We talked about security issues and a mutual desire to coordinate in the war on terror. We talked about humanitarian issues. As the Prime Minister noted, the United States is supporting the fight against HIV/ AIDS in Vietnam, and he gave me a report on the progress about our mutual desire to help those who suffer with HIV/AIDS. We signed a landmark agreement that will make it easier for people to worship freely in Vietnam. And finally, I want to thank the Prime Minister for his Government's willingness to continue to work on the—on finding the remains of those who lost their lives in Vietnam. It's very comforting to many families here in America to understand that the Government is providing information to help close a sad chapter in their lives. And finally, the Prime Minister graciously invited me to Vietnam. I will be going in 2006. I'm looking forward to my trip. I'm also looking forward to the APEC Summit that Vietnam will be hosting. Mr. Prime Minister, welcome. Prime Minister Khai. Thank you very much Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. At the invitation of President George W. Bush, it gives me the great pleasure and honor as the first Vietnamese Prime Minister to pay an official visit to the United States. And this event, in itself, shows that Vietnam-U.S. relations have in fact entered a new stage of development. My visit to America this time coincides with the 10th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. During the talks that I had with Mr. President, Mr. President and I were pleased to note the significant developments in the two countries' relations, including the good progress made in addressing the various issues left over by the past as well as the various steps to be taken to expand our relations in the future. Mr. President and I also shared the view that proceeding from the interest of the two countries and given the new developments in the region and the world, the two countries' relationship should be enhanced. And we should aim to build a friendly relationship, constructive partnership, a comprehensive cooperation on a long-term and stable basis as well as on the basis of equality, mutual respect and benefits. We believe that America can find in Vietnam a potential cooperation partner. We have a population of 80 million people, which means a huge market for American businesses. And these people are also very hard working, creative, and dynamic. And they are now working very hard to achieve the goal of building Vietnam into a strong country with wealthy people and a democratic and advanced society. Vietnam is also actively integrating itself into the world economy and wishes to be a friend and reliable partner of all countries in the international community. I also highly appreciate Mr. President's strong support for Vietnam's early WTO accession, and we agreed that Vietnam's accession will be in the benefits of both countries, and we agree to continue with our bilateral negotiations with the aim of concluding those very soon. Mr. President and I also agreed that there remain differences between our two countries due to the different conditions that we have—the different histories and cultures. But we also agreed that we should work together through constructive dialog based upon mutual respect to reduce those differences in order to improve our bilateral relations. On international issues, Mr. President and I exchanged views on the recent developments in Asia and the Pacific, which we are both concerned about. And we also agreed on the needs to improve the effectiveness of APEC for which the 2006 APEC Summit in Vietnam will be an important milestone. I am also delighted that President Bush has accepted my invitation to visit Vietnam and to attend the 2006 APEC Summit, and we also welcome your support for the organization of this summit. I am fully confident that my visit to America this time will help uplift the relationship between our two countries to a new height, and may I finally wish America prosperity and happiness to her people. I thank you very much for your time. President Bush.

"Today, I have signed into law H.R. 1, the ""Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003."" The Act helps achieve a more modern Medicare system that includes prescription drug coverage and choices for seniors. Sections 1012 and 1014 of the Act create a commission and a working group, both with most of their members designated by Members of Congress or the Comptroller General, a legislative agent. Sections 1012(h)(3) and 1014(j)(3) purport to give the commission and the working group a right to secure directly from executive departments and agencies information they seek to perform their duties. The executive branch shall construe these provisions in a manner consistent with the constitutional authorities of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair the deliberative processes of the Executive or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties. Section 802 of the Act calls for the President to submit to the Congress proposals for legislation in the event that a Medicare funding warning is issued under section 801(a)(2). Many other provisions in the Act, including sections 101(b), 109(d)(2), 410A(e), 434(f), 507(c)(3), 645(a)(2), 649(g), 651(d)(2), 911(f), and 1014(o), also call for executive branch officials to submit to the Congress proposals for legislation. The executive branch shall construe these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to recommend for the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President judges necessary and expedient.

"I welcome the unanimous decisions made this week by trade ministers meeting in Doha, Qatar, to admit the People's Republic of China and Taiwan into the World Trade Organization (WTO). I believe that the entry of China and Taiwan into the WTO will strengthen the global trading system and expand world economic growth. China, with more than 1.2 billion people and a one trillion dollar annual gross domestic product, is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Taiwan is the world's 16th largest economy. The decision in Doha—reached following many years of negotiations—marks a formal agreement by the 142 members of the WTO on the steps that China and Taiwan must take to open their markets as WTO members. Taking these steps will introduce greater competition into both economies and mean that both follow the same trade rules as the United States and other trading partners. This, in turn, will generate greater trade and investment that will bring benefits to businesses, consumers, and workers in all of our economies. I am confident that China's entry into the WTO will bring other benefits to China beyond the expected economic benefits. WTO membership, for example, will require China to strengthen the rule of law and introduce certain civil reforms, such as the publication of rules. In the long run, an open, rules-based Chinese economy will be an important underpinning for Chinese democratic reforms. China and Taiwan now face the challenge of implementing their WTO commitments. The United States stands ready to work constructively with both economies to assist them in meeting the challenges of implementation. We also look forward to the great benefits we know that greater trade will bring to all our peoples.",statement-the-ministerial-decision-admit-the-peoples-republic-china-and-taiwan-into-the.txt,79,i

"Thank you all very much. Admiral Kelly, Captain Card, officers and sailors of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, my fellow Americans: Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country. In this battle, we have fought for the cause of liberty and for the peace of the world. Our Nation and our coalition are proud of this accomplishment; yet it is you, the members of the United States military, who achieved it. Your courage, your willingness to face danger for your country and for each other, made this day possible. Because of you, our Nation is more secure. Because of you, the tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free. Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out with a combination of precision and speed and boldness the enemy did not expect and the world had not seen before. From distant bases or ships at sea, we sent planes and missiles that could destroy an enemy division or strike a single bunker. Marines and soldiers charged to Baghdad across 350 miles of hostile ground, in one of the swiftest advances of heavy arms in history. You have shown the world the skill and the might of the American Armed Forces. This Nation thanks all the members of our coalition who joined in a noble cause. We thank the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, who shared in the hardships of war. We thank all the citizens of Iraq who welcomed our troops and joined in the liberation of their own country. And tonight I have a special word for Secretary Rumsfeld, for General Franks, and for all the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States: America is grateful for a job well done. The character of our military through history—the daring of Normandy, the fierce courage of Iwo Jima, the decency and idealism that turned enemies into allies— is fully present in this generation. When Iraqi civilians looked into the faces of our service men and women, they saw strength and kindness and good will. When I look at the members of the United States military, I see the best of our country, and I'm honored to be your Commander in Chief. In the images of fallen statues, we have witnessed the arrival of a new era. For a hundred of years of war, culminating in the nuclear age, military technology was designed and deployed to inflict casualties on an ever-growing scale. In defeating Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Allied forces destroyed entire cities, while enemy leaders who started the conflict were safe until the final days. Military power was used to end a regime by breaking a nation. Today, we have the greater power to free a nation by breaking a dangerous and aggressive regime. With new tactics and precision weapons, we can achieve military objectives without directing violence against civilians. No device of man can remove the tragedy from war; yet it is a great advance when the guilty have far more to fear from war than the innocent. In the images of celebrating Iraqis, we have also seen the ageless appeal of human freedom. Decades of lies and intimidation could not make the Iraqi people love their oppressors or desire their own enslavement. Men and women in every culture need liberty like they need food and water and air. Everywhere that freedom arrives, humanity rejoices, and everywhere that freedom stirs, let tyrants fear. We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order to parts of that country that remain dangerous. We're pursuing and finding leaders of the old regime, who will be held to account for their crimes. We've begun the search for hidden chemical and biological weapons and already know of hundreds of sites that will be investigated. We're helping to rebuild Iraq, where the dictator built palaces for himself instead of hospitals and schools. And we will stand with the new leaders of Iraq as they establish a Government of, by, and for the Iraqi people. The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but it is worth every effort. Our coalition will stay until our work is done. And then we will leave, and we will leave behind a free Iraq. The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September the 11th, 2001, and still goes on. That terrible morning, 19 evil men, the shock troops of a hateful ideology, gave America and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions. They imagined, in the words of one terrorist, that September the 11th would be the ""beginning of the end of America."" By seeking to turn our cities into killing fields, terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this Nation's resolve and force our retreat from the world. They have failed. In the battle of Afghanistan, we destroyed the Taliban, many terrorists, and the camps where they trained. We continue to help the Afghan people lay roads, restore hospitals, and educate all of their children. Yet we also have dangerous work to complete. As I speak, a Special Operations task force, led by the 82d Airborne, is on the trail of the terrorists and those who seek to undermine the free Government of Afghanistan. America and our coalition will finish what we have begun. From Pakistan to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, we are hunting down Al Qaida killers. Nineteen months ago, I pledged that the terrorists would not escape the patient justice of the United States. And as of tonight, nearly one-half of Al Qaida's senior operatives have been captured or killed. The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror. We've removed an ally of Al Qaida and cut off a source of terrorist funding. And this much is certain: No terrorist network will gain weapons of mass destruction from the Iraqi regime, because the regime is no more. In these 19 months that changed the world, our actions have been focused and deliberate and proportionate to the offense. We have not forgotten the victims of September the 11th—the last phone calls, the cold murder of children, the searches in the rubble. With those attacks, the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States, and war is what they got. Our war against terror is proceeding according to the principles that I have made clear to all: Any person involved in committing or planning terrorist attacks against the American people becomes an enemy of this country and a target of American justice; any person, organization, or government that supports, protects, or harbors terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent and equally guilty of terrorist crimes; any outlaw regime that has ties to terrorist groups and seeks or possesses weapons of mass destruction is a grave danger to the civilized world and will be confronted; and anyone in the world, including the Arab world, who works and sacrifices for freedom has a loyal friend in the United States of America. Our commitment to liberty is America's tradition, declared at our founding, affirmed in Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms, asserted in the Truman Doctrine and in Ronald Reagan's challenge to an evil empire. We are committed to freedom in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in a peaceful Palestine. The advance of freedom is the surest strategy to undermine the appeal of terror in the world. Where freedom takes hold, hatred gives way to hope. When freedom takes hold, men and women turn to the peaceful pursuit of a better life. American values and American interests lead in the same direction: We stand for human liberty. The United States upholds these principles of security and freedom in many ways, with all the tools of diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence, and finance. We're working with a broad coalition of nations that understand the threat and our shared responsibility to meet it. The use of force has been and remains our last resort. Yet all can know, friend and foe alike, that our Nation has a mission: We will answer threats to our security, and we will defend the peace. Our mission continues. Al Qaida is wounded, not destroyed. The scattered cells of the terrorist network still operate in many nations, and we know from daily intelligence that they continue to plot against free people. The proliferation of deadly weapons remains a serious danger. The enemies of freedom are not idle, and neither are we. Our Government has taken unprecedented measures to defend the homeland, and we will continue to hunt down the enemy before he can strike. The war on terror is not over, yet it is not endless. We do not know the day of final victory, but we have seen the turning of the tide. No act of the terrorists will change our purpose or weaken our resolve or alter their fate. Their cause is lost. Free nations will press on to victory. Other nations in history have fought in foreign lands and remained to occupy and exploit. Americans, following a battle, want nothing more than to return home. And that is your direction tonight. After service in the Afghan and Iraqi theaters of war, after 100,000 miles on the longest carrier deployment in recent history, you are homeward bound. Some of you will see new family members for the first time; 150 babies were born while their fathers were on the Lincoln. Your families are proud of you, and your Nation will welcome you. We are mindful as well that some good men and women are not making the journey home. One of those who fell, Corporal Jason Mileo, spoke to his parents 5 days before his death. Jason's father said, ""He called us from the center of Baghdad, not to brag but to tell us he loved us. Our son was a soldier."" Every name, every life, is a loss to our military, to our Nation, and to the loved ones who grieve. There's no homecoming for these families. Yet we pray, in God's time, their reunion will come. Those we lost were last seen on duty. Their final act on this Earth was to fight a great evil and bring liberty to others. All of you—all in this generation of our military—have taken up the highest calling of history. You're defending your country and protecting the innocent from harm. And wherever you go, you carry a message of hope, a message that is ancient and ever new. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, ""To the captives, ‘come out,' and to those in darkness, ‘be free.""' Thank you for serving our country and our cause. May God bless you all, and may God continue to bless America.",address-the-nation-iraq-from-the-uss-abraham-lincoln.txt,10,thank you all very much admiral kelly captain card officers and sailors of

Captain Card, officers and sailors of the U.S.S.', 'Abraham Lincoln, my fellow Americans: Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.', 'In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.', 'And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country.', 'In this battle, we have fought for the cause of liberty and for the peace of the world.', 'Our Nation and our coalition are proud of this accomplishment; yet it is you, the members of the United States military, who achieved it.', 'Your courage, your willingness to face danger for your country and for each other, made this day possible.', 'Because of you, our Nation is more secure.', 'Because of you, the tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free.', 'Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out with a combination of precision and speed and boldness the enemy did not expect and the world had not seen before.', 'From distant bases or ships at sea, we sent planes and missiles that could destroy an enemy division or strike a single bunker.', 'Marines and soldiers charged to Baghdad across 350 miles of hostile ground, in one of the swiftest advances of heavy arms in history.', 'You have shown the world the skill and the might of the American Armed Forces.', 'This Nation thanks all the members of our coalition who joined in a noble cause.', 'We thank the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, who shared in the hardships of war.', 'We thank all the citizens of Iraq who welcomed our troops and joined in the liberation of their own country.', 'And tonight I have a special word for Secretary Rumsfeld, for General Franks, and for all the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States: America is grateful for a job well done.', 'The character of our military through history—the daring of Normandy, the fierce courage of Iwo Jima, the decency and idealism that turned enemies into allies— is fully present in this generation.', 'When Iraqi civilians looked into the faces of our service men and women, they saw strength and kindness and good will.', ""When I look at the members of the United States military, I see the best of our country, and I'm honored to be your Commander in Chief."", 'In the images of fallen statues, we have witnessed the arrival of a new era.', 'For a hundred of years of war, culminating in the nuclear age, military technology was designed and deployed to inflict casualties on an ever-growing scale.', 'In defeating Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Allied forces destroyed entire cities, while enemy leaders who started the conflict were safe until the final days.', 'Military power was used to end a regime by breaking a nation.', 'Today, we have the greater power to free a nation by breaking a dangerous and aggressive regime.', 'With new tactics and precision weapons, we can achieve military objectives without directing violence against civilians.', 'No device of man can remove the tragedy from war; yet it is a great advance when the guilty have far more to fear from war than the innocent.', 'In the images of celebrating Iraqis, we have also seen the ageless appeal of human freedom.', 'Decades of lies and intimidation could not make the Iraqi people love their oppressors or desire their own enslavement.', 'Men and women in every culture need liberty like they need food and water and air.', 'Everywhere that freedom arrives, humanity rejoices, and everywhere that freedom stirs, let tyrants fear.', 'We have difficult work to do in Iraq.', ""We're bringing order to parts of that country that remain dangerous."", ""We're pursuing and finding leaders of the old regime, who will be held to account for their crimes."", ""We've begun the search for hidden chemical and biological weapons and already know of hundreds of sites that will be investigated."", ""We're helping to rebuild Iraq, where the dictator built palaces for himself instead of hospitals and schools."", 'And we will stand with the new leaders of Iraq as they establish a Government of, by, and for the Iraqi people.', 'The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but it is worth every effort.', 'Our coalition will stay until our work is done.', 'And then we will leave, and we will leave behind a free Iraq.', 'The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September the 11th, 2001, and still goes on.', 'That terrible morning, 19 evil men, the shock troops of a hateful ideology, gave America and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions.', 'They imagined, in the words of one terrorist, that September the 11th would be the ""beginning of the end of America.""', ""By seeking to turn our cities into killing fields, terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this Nation's resolve and force our retreat from the world."", 'They have failed.', 'In the battle of Afghanistan, we destroyed the Taliban, many terrorists, and the camps where they trained.', 'We continue to help the Afghan people lay roads, restore hospitals, and educate all of their children.', 'Yet we also have dangerous work to complete.', 'As I speak, a Special Operations task force, led by the 82d Airborne, is on the trail of the terrorists and those who seek to undermine the free Government of Afghanistan.', 'America and our coalition will finish what we have begun.', 'From Pakistan to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, we are hunting down Al Qaida killers.', 'Nineteen months ago, I pledged that the terrorists would not escape the patient justice of the United States.', ""And as of tonight, nearly one-half of Al Qaida's senior operatives have been captured or killed."", 'The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror.', ""We've removed an ally of Al Qaida and cut off a source of terrorist funding."", 'And this much is certain: No terrorist network will gain weapons of mass destruction from the Iraqi regime, because the regime is no more.', 'In these 19 months that changed the world, our actions have been focused and deliberate and proportionate to the offense.', 'We have not forgotten the victims of September the 11th—the last phone calls, the cold murder of children, the searches in the rubble.', 'With those attacks, the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States, and war is what they got.', 'Our war against terror is proceeding according to the principles that I have made clear to all: Any person involved in committing or planning terrorist attacks against the American people becomes an enemy of this country and a target of American justice; any person, organization, or government that supports, protects, or harbors terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent and equally guilty of terrorist crimes; any outlaw regime that has ties to terrorist groups and seeks or possesses weapons of mass destruction is a grave danger to the civilized world and will be confronted; and anyone in the world, including the Arab world, who works and sacrifices for freedom has a loyal friend in the United States of America.', ""Our commitment to liberty is America's tradition, declared at our founding, affirmed in Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms, asserted in the Truman Doctrine and in Ronald Reagan's challenge to an evil empire."", 'We are committed to freedom in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in a peaceful Palestine.', 'The advance of freedom is the surest strategy to undermine the appeal of terror in the world.', 'Where freedom takes hold, hatred gives way to hope.', 'When freedom takes hold, men and women turn to the peaceful pursuit of a better life.', 'American values and American interests lead in the same direction: We stand for human liberty.', 'The United States upholds these principles of security and freedom in many ways, with all the tools of diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence, and finance.', ""We're working with a broad coalition of nations that understand the threat and our shared responsibility to meet it."", 'The use of force has been and remains our last resort.', 'Yet all can know, friend and foe alike, that our Nation has a mission: We will answer threats to our security, and we will defend the peace.', 'Our mission continues.', 'Al Qaida is wounded, not destroyed.', 'The scattered cells of the terrorist network still operate in many nations, and we know from daily intelligence that they continue to plot against free people.', 'The proliferation of deadly weapons remains a serious danger.', 'The enemies of freedom are not idle, and neither are we.', 'Our Government has taken unprecedented measures to defend the homeland, and we will continue to hunt down the enemy before he can strike.', 'The war on terror is not over, yet it is not endless.', 'We do not know the day of final victory, but we have seen the turning of the tide.', 'No act of the terrorists will change our purpose or weaken our resolve or alter their fate.', 'Their cause is lost.', 'Free nations will press on to victory.', 'Other nations in history have fought in foreign lands and remained to occupy and exploit.', 'Americans, following a battle, want nothing more than to return home.', 'And that is your direction tonight.', 'After service in the Afghan and Iraqi theaters of war, after 100,000 miles on the longest carrier deployment in recent history, you are homeward bound.', 'Some of you will see new family members for the first time; 150 babies were born while their fathers were on the Lincoln.', 'Your families are proud of you, and your Nation will welcome you.', 'We are mindful as well that some good men and women are not making the journey home.', 'One of those who fell, Corporal Jason Mileo, spoke to his parents 5 days before his death.', 'Jason\'s father said, ""He called us from the center of Baghdad, not to brag but to tell us he loved us.', 'Our son was a soldier.""', 'Every name, every life, is a loss to our military, to our Nation, and to the loved ones who grieve.', ""There's no homecoming for these families."", ""Yet we pray, in God's time, their reunion will come."", 'Those we lost were last seen on duty.', 'Their final act on this Earth was to fight a great evil and bring liberty to others.', 'All of you—all in this generation of our military—have taken up the highest calling of history.', ""You're defending your country and protecting the innocent from harm."", 'And wherever you go, you carry a message of hope, a message that is ancient and ever new.', 'In the words of the prophet Isaiah, ""To the captives, ‘come out,\' and to those in darkness, ‘be free.""\'', 'Thank you for serving our country and our cause.', 'May God bless you all, and may God

"Today, The Bush Administration Announced The Implementation Plan For The National Strategy For Pandemic Influenza. The President's Homeland Security Advisor, Frances Townsend, discussed the Avian and Pandemic Influenza threat and outlined the Federal Government's preparedness and response steps. The Plan translates the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza into more than 300 actions for Federal departments and agencies and sets clear expectations for State and local governments and other non-Federal entities. It also provides guidance for all Federal departments and agencies on the development of their own plans. The Administration Is Taking Action To Prepare For A Possible Pandemic. On November 1, 2005, the day the President announced the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, the Administration also submitted a $7.1 billion emergency budget supplemental request to Congress for pandemic preparedness funding. The request supports the President's strategy by investing in international health surveillance and containment efforts; medical stockpiles; the domestic capacity to produce emergency supplies of pandemic vaccine and antiviral medications; and preparedness at all levels of government. On December 30, 2005, the President signed the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006. The Act includes $3.8 billion for pandemic influenza preparedness, the first installment of the President's request to launch these critical activities. The Act also provides comprehensive liability protection for pandemic countermeasures, as well as a compensation program for individuals who are inadvertently harmed by a pandemic countermeasure. Taken together these steps remove a major impediment to the establishment of a domestic vaccine production base - one of the most critical elements of the President's Strategy. The President's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2007 includes a $2.3 billion allowance to support the next phase of the President's strategy. The Avian And Pandemic Influenza Threat Pandemic Influenza Poses A Greater Risk Than Seasonal Influenza. Most Americans are familiar with seasonal influenza or the ""flu"" - a respiratory illness that makes hundreds of thousands of people in the United States sick every year. For most healthy people, seasonal influenza is not life-threatening. Pandemic influenza is different from seasonal influenza because it occurs when a new strain of influenza emerges that can be transmitted easily from person-to-person and for which people have no immunity. Unlike seasonal influenza, which typically affects the frail and sick, pandemic influenza could present as much risk to the young and healthy. The Federal Government Is Closely Monitoring An Avian Influenza Virus Known As H5N1. This influenza strain has infected domesticated birds, including chickens, and also migratory and other wild birds in 50 countries across Asia, Europe, and Africa. It has also infected more than 200 people worldwide. Today, H5N1 Avian Influenza Affects Primarily Birds - This Does Not Signal The Start Of A Pandemic. Unless people come into direct contact with infected birds, it is unlikely they will contract the disease. There are no reported cases of sustained human-to-human transmission of the current strain of avian flu. If the virus develops the capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission, however, it could spread quickly around the world. Translating The National Strategy For Pandemic Influenza Into Action The Federal Government Is Releasing The National Implementation Plan To Help The Nation Prepare For The Possibility Of A Pandemic. Shortly after announcing the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, the White House led the development of an Implementation Plan for the National Strategy. The Implementation Plan provides clear direction to Federal departments and agencies, State and local governments, communities, and the private sector on the actions that must be taken to prepare for a possible pandemic across the following six functional areas:  International Efforts - Prevent And Contain Outbreaks Abroad Transportation And Borders - Slow The Arrival And Spread Of A Pandemic Protecting Human Health - Limit Spread And Mitigate Illness Protecting Animal Health - Control Influenza With Human Pandemic Potential In Animals Law Enforcement, Public Safety, And Security - Ensure Civil Order During A Pandemic Planning By Institutions - Protect Personnel And Ensure Continuity Of Operations  The Implementation Plan provides a common frame of reference for understanding the pandemic threat and summarizes key planning considerations for all public and private stakeholders. It also requires that Federal departments and agencies take specific coordinated steps to achieve the goals of the Strategy and outlines expectations of non-Federal stakeholders in the United States and abroad. The Implementation Plan will be continually updated and revised. The Importance Of Preparedness By Individuals, Communities, And The Private Sector Individuals Must Actively Participate. Simple infection-control measures including hand washing and staying home when ill are critical. Individuals should actively participate in their communities' responses. State And Local Governments Must Prepare. Pandemics are global events, but individual communities experience pandemics as local events. State and local governments, with clear guidance from the Federal Government, should be prepared to implement community-wide measures, such as school closures and suspension of public gatherings, to halt the spread of disease. The Private Sector Must Prepare. The private sector, with targeted and timely guidance from the Federal Government, should develop plans to provide essential services even in the face of sustained and significant absenteeism. Businesses should also integrate their planning into their communities' planning. Four Federal Priority Actions In The Implementation Plan 1. Advance International Capacity For Early Warning And Response.  Advance International Cooperation: Working through the U.S.-initiated International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, secure international commitment to transparency, scientific cooperation, rapid reporting of human and animal cases, and sharing of data and viral isolates. Build International Capacity: Provide technical assistance to build veterinary and public health capacity in at-risk countries and to detect and contain animal and human outbreaks of avian influenza, including development and exercise of preparedness plans. Ensure Rapid Response: Develop the Federal Government's capability to respond rapidly, either independently or in support of an international response, to animal or human outbreaks of influenza with pandemic potential for purposes of assessment and containment.  2. Limit The Arrival And Spread Of A Pandemic.  Ensure Early Warning And Situational Awareness: Enhance domestic avian influenza surveillance in humans, wild birds, and poultry. Establish A Border And Transportation Strategy: Develop a comprehensive border and transportation strategy that strikes a balance between efficacy of interventions to delay and limit the spread of disease and the economic and societal consequences, international implications, and operational feasibility of these interventions. Establish Screening Protocols And Implementation Agreements: Establish arrangements with international partners to voluntarily limit travel and establish screening for travelers from affected areas.  3. Provide Clear Guidance To All Stakeholders.  Ensure Effective Risk Communication: Implement educational and risk communications programs to increase national and international awareness of the risks of avian influenza and appropriate behaviors to reduce these risks. Ensure that timely, accurate, and credible information is provided by spokespeople at all levels of government during an outbreak. Provide Guidance On Distributing Urgent Resources: Develop and share with State, local, and tribal public health officials and the medical community strategies for optimizing the allocation of scarce medical resources during periods of sharp surges in the need for medical services and mechanisms for incorporating additional health care providers within defined settings. Provide Comprehensive Guidance To Limit The Spread Of Disease: Develop for State, local, and tribal partners a template for community containment that builds upon data available from state-of-the art modeling and scientific understanding of influenza biology and patterns of transmission. Provide Clear Guidance For The Public And Private Sectors: Develop pandemic planning guidance for private sector, Federal, State, local, and tribal entities.  4. Accelerate The Development Of Countermeasures.  Develop Rapid Diagnostics: Support development of rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnostic tests, to be used in the clinical setting and for screening. Establish Stockpiles Of Vaccine And Antiviral Medications: Build stockpiles of pre-pandemic vaccine and antiviral medications and define strategies for use. Advance Technology And Production Capacity For Influenza Vaccine: Develop cell-based vaccine-manufacturing methods, increase domestic vaccine production capacity, and advance the development of next-generation influenza diagnostics and countermeasures, including the most effective methods of preparing for and responding to a surge in demand for medical services.",fact-sheet-advancing-the-nations-preparedness-for-pandemic-influenza.txt,18,today the bush administration announced the implementation plan for the national strategy for pandemic influenza

Plan For The National Strategy For Pandemic Influenza.', ""The President's Homeland Security Advisor, Frances Townsend, discussed the Avian and Pandemic Influenza threat and outlined the Federal Government's preparedness and response steps."", 'The Plan translates the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza into more than 300 actions for Federal departments and agencies and sets clear expectations for State and local governments and other non-Federal entities.', 'It also provides guidance for all Federal departments and agencies on the development of their own plans.', 'The Administration Is Taking Action To Prepare For A Possible Pandemic.', 'On November 1, 2005, the day the President announced the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, the Administration also submitted a $7.1 billion emergency budget supplemental request to Congress for pandemic preparedness funding.', ""The request supports the President's strategy by investing in international health surveillance and containment efforts; medical stockpiles; the domestic capacity to produce emergency supplies of pandemic vaccine and antiviral medications; and preparedness at all levels of government."", 'On December 30, 2005, the President signed the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006.', ""The Act includes $3.8 billion for pandemic influenza preparedness, the first installment of the President's request to launch these critical activities."", 'The Act also provides comprehensive liability protection for pandemic countermeasures, as well as a compensation program for individuals who are inadvertently harmed by a pandemic countermeasure.', ""Taken together these steps remove a major impediment to the establishment of a domestic vaccine production base - one of the most critical elements of the President's Strategy."", ""The President's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2007 includes a $2.3 billion allowance to support the next phase of the President's strategy."", 'The Avian And Pandemic Influenza Threat Pandemic Influenza Poses A Greater Risk Than Seasonal Influenza.', 'Most Americans are familiar with seasonal influenza or the ""flu"" - a respiratory illness that makes hundreds of thousands of people in the United States sick every year.', 'For most healthy people, seasonal influenza is not life-threatening.', 'Pandemic influenza is different from seasonal influenza because it occurs when a new strain of influenza emerges that can be transmitted easily from person-to-person and for which people have no immunity.', 'Unlike seasonal influenza, which typically affects the frail and sick, pandemic influenza could present as much risk to the young and healthy.', 'The Federal Government Is Closely Monitoring An Avian Influenza Virus Known As H5N1.', 'This influenza strain has infected domesticated birds, including chickens, and also migratory and other wild birds in 50 countries across Asia, Europe, and Africa.', 'It has also infected more than 200 people worldwide.', 'Today, H5N1 Avian Influenza Affects Primarily Birds - This Does Not Signal The Start Of A Pandemic.', 'Unless people come into direct contact with infected birds, it is unlikely they will contract the disease.', 'There are no reported cases of sustained human-to-human transmission of the current strain of avian flu.', 'If the virus develops the capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission, however, it could spread quickly around the world.', 'Translating The National Strategy For Pandemic Influenza Into Action The Federal Government Is Releasing The National Implementation Plan To Help The Nation Prepare For The Possibility Of A Pandemic.', 'Shortly after announcing the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, the White House led the development of an Implementation Plan for the National Strategy.', 'The Implementation Plan provides clear direction to Federal departments and agencies, State and local governments, communities, and the private sector on the actions that must be taken to prepare for a possible pandemic across the following six functional areas:  International Efforts - Prevent And Contain Outbreaks Abroad Transportation And Borders - Slow The Arrival And Spread Of A Pandemic Protecting Human Health - Limit Spread And Mitigate Illness Protecting Animal Health - Control Influenza With Human Pandemic Potential In Animals Law Enforcement, Public Safety, And Security - Ensure Civil Order During A Pandemic Planning By Institutions - Protect Personnel And Ensure Continuity Of Operations  The Implementation Plan provides a common frame of reference for understanding the pandemic threat and summarizes key planning considerations for all public and private stakeholders.', 'It also requires that Federal departments and agencies take specific coordinated steps to achieve the goals of the Strategy and outlines expectations of non-Federal stakeholders in the United States and abroad.', 'The Implementation Plan will be continually updated and revised.', 'The Importance Of Preparedness By Individuals, Communities, And The Private Sector Individuals Must Actively Participate.', 'Simple infection-control measures including hand washing and staying home when ill are critical.', ""Individuals should actively participate in their communities' responses."", 'State And Local Governments Must Prepare.', 'Pandemics are global events, but individual communities experience pandemics as local events.', 'State and local governments, with clear guidance from the Federal Government, should be prepared to implement community-wide measures, such as school closures and suspension of public gatherings, to halt the spread of disease.', 'The Private Sector Must Prepare.', 'The private sector, with targeted and timely guidance from the Federal Government, should develop plans to provide essential services even in the face of sustained and significant absenteeism.', ""Businesses should also integrate their planning into their communities' planning."", 'Four Federal Priority Actions In The Implementation Plan 1.', 'Advance International Capacity For Early Warning And Response.', 'Advance International Cooperation: Working through the U.S.-initiated International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, secure international commitment to transparency, scientific cooperation, rapid reporting of human and animal cases, and sharing of data and viral isolates.', 'Build International Capacity: Provide technical assistance to build veterinary and public health capacity in at-risk countries and to detect and contain animal and human outbreaks of avian influenza, including development and exercise of preparedness plans.', ""Ensure Rapid Response: Develop the Federal Government's capability to respond rapidly, either independently or in support of an international response, to animal or human outbreaks of influenza with pandemic potential for purposes of assessment and containment."", '2.', 'Limit The Arrival And Spread Of A Pandemic.', 'Ensure Early Warning And Situational Awareness: Enhance domestic avian influenza surveillance in humans, wild birds, and poultry.', 'Establish A Border And Transportation Strategy: Develop a comprehensive border and transportation strategy that strikes a balance between efficacy of interventions to delay and limit the spread of disease and the economic and societal consequences, international implications, and operational feasibility of these interventions.', 'Establish Screening Protocols And Implementation Agreements: Establish arrangements with international partners to voluntarily limit travel and establish screening for travelers from affected areas.', '3.', 'Provide Clear Guidance To All Stakeholders.', 'Ensure Effective Risk Communication: Implement educational and risk communications programs to increase national and international awareness of the risks of avian influenza and appropriate behaviors to reduce these risks.', 'Ensure that timely, accurate, and credible information is provided by spokespeople at all levels of government during an outbreak.', 'Provide Guidance On Distributing Urgent Resources: Develop and share with State, local, and tribal public health officials and the medical community strategies for optimizing the allocation of scarce medical resources during periods of sharp surges in the need for medical services and mechanisms for incorporating additional health care providers within defined settings.', 'Provide Comprehensive Guidance To Limit The Spread Of Disease: Develop for State, local, and tribal partners a template for community containment that builds upon data available from state-of-the art modeling and scientific understanding of influenza biology and patterns of transmission.', 'Provide Clear Guidance For The Public And Private Sectors: Develop pandemic planning guidance for private sector, Federal, State, local, and tribal entities.', '4.', 'Accelerate The Development Of Countermeasures.', 'Develop Rapid Diagnostics: Support development of rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnostic tests, to be used in the clinical setting and for screening.', 'Establish Stockpiles Of Vaccine And Antiviral Medications: Build stockpiles of pre-pandemic vaccine and antiviral medications and define strategies for use.', 'Advance Technology And Production Capacity For Influenza Vaccine: Develop cell-based vaccine-manufacturing methods, increase domestic vaccine production capacity, and advance the development of next-generation influenza diagnostics and countermeasures, including the most effective methods of preparing for and responding to a surge in demand for medical services.']","['Today', ',', 'The', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'Announced', 'The', 'Implementation', 'Plan', 'For', 'The',

"My fellow citizens, events in Iraq have now reached the final days of decision. For more than a decade, the United States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime without war. That regime pledged to reveal and destroy all its weapons of mass destruction as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Since then, the world has engaged in 12 years of diplomacy. We have passed more than a dozen resolutions in the United Nations Security Council. We have sent hundreds of weapons inspectors to oversee the disarmament of Iraq. Our good faith has not been returned. The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage. It has uniformly defied Security Council resolutions demanding full disarmament. Over the years, U.N. weapon inspectors have been threatened by Iraqi officials, electronically bugged, and systematically deceived. Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed again and again because we are not dealing with peaceful men. Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's neighbors and against Iraq's people. The regime has a history of reckless aggression in the Middle East. It has a deep hatred of America and our friends. And it has aided, trained, and harbored terrorists, including operatives of Al Qaida. The danger is clear: Using chemical, biological or, one day, nuclear weapons obtained with the help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country or any other. The United States and other nations did nothing to deserve or invite this threat. But we will do everything to defeat it. Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course toward safety. Before the day of horror can come, before it is too late to act, this danger will be removed. The United States of America has the sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security. That duty falls to me as Commander in Chief, by the oath I have sworn, by the oath I will keep. Recognizing the threat to our country, the United States Congress voted overwhelmingly last year to support the use of force against Iraq. America tried to work with the United Nations to address this threat because we wanted to resolve the issue peacefully. We believe in the mission of the United Nations. One reason theU.N. was founded after the Second World War was to confront aggressive dictators actively and early, before they can attack the innocent and destroy the peace. In the case of Iraq, the Security Council did act in the early 1990s. Under Resolutions 678 and 687, both still in effect, the United States and our allies are authorized to use force in ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. This is not a question of authority. It is a question of will. Last September, I went to the U.N. General Assembly and urged the nations of the world to unite and bring an end to this danger. On November 8th, the Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441, finding Iraq in material breach of its obligations and vowing serious consequences if Iraq did not fully and immediately disarm. Today, no nation can possibly claim that Iraq has disarmed, and it will not disarm so long as Saddam Hussein holds power. For the last 4 1/2 months, the United States and our allies have worked within the Security Council to enforce that Council's long-standing demands. Yet, some permanent members of the Security Council have publicly announced they will veto any resolution that compels the disarmament of Iraq. These governments share our assessment of the danger but not our resolve to meet it. Many nations, however, do have the resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace, and a broad coalition is now gathering to enforce the just demands of the world. The United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours. In recent days, some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part. They have delivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave Iraq, so that disarmament can proceed peacefully. He has thus far refused. All the decades of deceit and cruelty have now reached an end. Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing. For their own safety, all foreign nationals, including journalists and inspectors, should leave Iraq immediately. Many Iraqis can hear me tonight in a translated radio broadcast, and I have a message for them: If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men who rule your country and not against you. As our coalition takes away their power, we will deliver the food and medicine you need. We will tear down the apparatus of terror, and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free. In a free Iraq, there will be no more wars of aggression against your neighbors, no more poison factories, no more executions of dissidents, no more torture chambers and rape rooms. The tyrant will soon be gone. The day of your liberation is near. It is too late for Saddam Hussein to remain in power. It is not too late for the Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country by permitting the peaceful entry of coalition forces to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Our forces will give Iraqi military units clear instructions on actions they can take to avoid being attacked and destroyed. I urge every member of the Iraqi military and intelligence services: If war comes, do not fight for a dying regime that is not worth your own life. And all Iraqi military and civilian personnel should listen carefully to this warning: In any conflict, your fate will depend on your actions. Do not destroy oil wells, a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people. Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass destruction against anyone, including the Iraqi people. War crimes will be prosecuted. War criminals will be punished. And it will be no defense to say, ""I was just following orders."" Should Saddam Hussein choose confrontation, the American people can know that every measure has been taken to avoid war and every measure will be taken to win it. Americans understand the costs of conflict because we have paid them in the past. War has no certainty, except the certainty of sacrifice. Yet, the only way to reduce the harm and duration of war is to apply the full force and might of our military, and we are prepared to do so. If Saddam Hussein attempts to cling to power, he will remain a deadly foe until the end. In desperation, he and terrorists groups might try to conduct terrorist operations against the American people and our friends. These attacks are not inevitable. They are, however, possible. And this very fact underscores the reason we cannot live under the threat of blackmail. The terrorist threat to America and the world will be diminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed. Our Government is on heightened watch against these dangers. Just as we are preparing to ensure victory in Iraq, we are taking further actions to protect our homeland. In recent days, American authorities have expelled from the country certain individuals with ties to Iraqi intelligence services. Among other measures, I have directed additional security of our airports and increased Coast Guard patrols of major seaports. The Department of Homeland Security is working closely with the Nation's Governors to increase armed security at critical facilities across America. Should enemies strike our country, they would be attempting to shift our attention with panic and weaken our morale with fear. In this, they would fail. No act of theirs can alter the course or shake the resolve of this country. We are a peaceful people. Yet we're not a fragile people, and we will not be intimidated by thugs and killers. If our enemies dare to strike us, they and all who have aided them will face fearful consequences. We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater. In 1 year, or 5 years, the power of Iraq to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many times over. With these capabilities, Saddam Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose the moment of deadly conflict when they are strongest. We choose to meet that threat now, where it arises, before it can appear suddenly in our skies and cities. The cause of peace requires all free nations to recognize new and undeniable realities. In the 20th century, some chose to appease murderous dictators, whose threats were allowed to grow into genocide and global war. In this century, when evil men plot chemical, biological, and nuclear terror, a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never before seen on this Earth. Terrorists and terror states do not reveal these threats with fair notice, in formal declarations. And responding to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self-defense; it is suicide. The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein now. As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the deepest commitments of our country. Unlike Saddam Hussein, we believe the Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human liberty. And when the dictator has departed, they can set an example to all the Middle East of a vital and peaceful and self-governing nation. The United States, with other countries, will work to advance liberty and peace in that region. Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but it can come over time. The power and appeal of human liberty is felt in every life and every land. And the greatest power of freedom is to overcome hatred and violence and turn the creative gifts of men and women to the pursuits of peace. That is the future we choose. Free nations have a duty to defend our people by uniting against the violent. And tonight, as we have done before, America and our allies accept that responsibility. Good night, and may God continue to bless America.",address-the-nation-iraq.txt,11,my fellow citizens events in iraq have now reached the final days of decision for more than a decade the united

final days of decision.', 'For more than a decade, the United States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime without war.', 'That regime pledged to reveal and destroy all its weapons of mass destruction as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf war in 1991.', 'Since then, the world has engaged in 12 years of diplomacy.', 'We have passed more than a dozen resolutions in the United Nations Security Council.', 'We have sent hundreds of weapons inspectors to oversee the disarmament of Iraq.', 'Our good faith has not been returned.', 'The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage.', 'It has uniformly defied Security Council resolutions demanding full disarmament.', 'Over the years, U.N. weapon inspectors have been threatened by Iraqi officials, electronically bugged, and systematically deceived.', 'Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed again and again because we are not dealing with peaceful men.', 'Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised.', ""This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's neighbors and against Iraq's people."", 'The regime has a history of reckless aggression in the Middle East.', 'It has a deep hatred of America and our friends.', 'And it has aided, trained, and harbored terrorists, including operatives of Al Qaida.', 'The danger is clear: Using chemical, biological or, one day, nuclear weapons obtained with the help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country or any other.', 'The United States and other nations did nothing to deserve or invite this threat.', 'But we will do everything to defeat it.', 'Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course toward safety.', 'Before the day of horror can come, before it is too late to act, this danger will be removed.', 'The United States of America has the sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security.', 'That duty falls to me as Commander in Chief, by the oath I have sworn, by the oath I will keep.', 'Recognizing the threat to our country, the United States Congress voted overwhelmingly last year to support the use of force against Iraq.', 'America tried to work with the United Nations to address this threat because we wanted to resolve the issue peacefully.', 'We believe in the mission of the United Nations.', 'One reason theU.N.', 'was founded after the Second World War was to confront aggressive dictators actively and early, before they can attack the innocent and destroy the peace.', 'In the case of Iraq, the Security Council did act in the early 1990s.', 'Under Resolutions 678 and 687, both still in effect, the United States and our allies are authorized to use force in ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction.', 'This is not a question of authority.', 'It is a question of will.', 'Last September, I went to the U.N. General Assembly and urged the nations of the world to unite and bring an end to this danger.', 'On November 8th, the Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441, finding Iraq in material breach of its obligations and vowing serious consequences if Iraq did not fully and immediately disarm.', 'Today, no nation can possibly claim that Iraq has disarmed, and it will not disarm so long as Saddam Hussein holds power.', ""For the last 4 1/2 months, the United States and our allies have worked within the Security Council to enforce that Council's long-standing demands."", 'Yet, some permanent members of the Security Council have publicly announced they will veto any resolution that compels the disarmament of Iraq.', 'These governments share our assessment of the danger but not our resolve to meet it.', 'Many nations, however, do have the resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace, and a broad coalition is now gathering to enforce the just demands of the world.', 'The United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours.', 'In recent days, some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part.', 'They have delivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave Iraq, so that disarmament can proceed peacefully.', 'He has thus far refused.', 'All the decades of deceit and cruelty have now reached an end.', 'Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours.', 'Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing.', 'For their own safety, all foreign nationals, including journalists and inspectors, should leave Iraq immediately.', 'Many Iraqis can hear me tonight in a translated radio broadcast, and I have a message for them: If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men who rule your country and not against you.', 'As our coalition takes away their power, we will deliver the food and medicine you need.', 'We will tear down the apparatus of terror, and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free.', 'In a free Iraq, there will be no more wars of aggression against your neighbors, no more poison factories, no more executions of dissidents, no more torture chambers and rape rooms.', 'The tyrant will soon be gone.', 'The day of your liberation is near.', 'It is too late for Saddam Hussein to remain in power.', 'It is not too late for the Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country by permitting the peaceful entry of coalition forces to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.', 'Our forces will give Iraqi military units clear instructions on actions they can take to avoid being attacked and destroyed.', 'I urge every member of the Iraqi military and intelligence services: If war comes, do not fight for a dying regime that is not worth your own life.', 'And all Iraqi military and civilian personnel should listen carefully to this warning: In any conflict, your fate will depend on your actions.', 'Do not destroy oil wells, a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people.', 'Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass destruction against anyone, including the Iraqi people.', 'War crimes will be prosecuted.', 'War criminals will be punished.', 'And it will be no defense to say, ""I was just following orders.""', 'Should Saddam Hussein choose confrontation, the American people can know that every measure has been taken to avoid war and every measure will be taken to win it.', 'Americans understand the costs of conflict because we have paid them in the past.', 'War has no certainty, except the certainty of sacrifice.', 'Yet, the only way to reduce the harm and duration of war is to apply the full force and might of our military, and we are prepared to do so.', 'If Saddam Hussein attempts to cling to power, he will remain a deadly foe until the end.', 'In desperation, he and terrorists groups might try to conduct terrorist operations against the American people and our friends.', 'These attacks are not inevitable.', 'They are, however, possible.', 'And this very fact underscores the reason we cannot live under the threat of blackmail.', 'The terrorist threat to America and the world will be diminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed.', 'Our Government is on heightened watch against these dangers.', 'Just as we are preparing to ensure victory in Iraq, we are taking further actions to protect our homeland.', 'In recent days, American authorities have expelled from the country certain individuals with ties to Iraqi intelligence services.', 'Among other measures, I have directed additional security of our airports and increased Coast Guard patrols of major seaports.', ""The Department of Homeland Security is working closely with the Nation's Governors to increase armed security at critical facilities across America."", 'Should enemies strike our country, they would be attempting to shift our attention with panic and weaken our morale with fear.', 'In this, they would fail.', 'No act of theirs can alter the course or shake the resolve of this country.', 'We are a peaceful people.', ""Yet we're not a fragile people, and we will not be intimidated by thugs and killers."", 'If our enemies dare to strike us, they and all who have aided them will face fearful consequences.', 'We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater.', 'In 1 year, or 5 years, the power of Iraq to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many times over.', 'With these capabilities, Saddam Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose the moment of deadly conflict when they are strongest.', 'We choose to meet that threat now, where it arises, before it can appear suddenly in our skies and cities.', 'The cause of peace requires all free nations to recognize new and undeniable realities.', 'In the 20th century, some chose to appease murderous dictators, whose threats were allowed to grow into genocide and global war.', 'In this century, when evil men plot chemical, biological, and nuclear terror, a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never before seen on this Earth.', 'Terrorists and terror states do not reveal these threats with fair notice, in formal declarations.', 'And responding to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self-defense; it is suicide.', 'The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein now.', 'As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the deepest commitments of our country.', 'Unlike Saddam Hussein, we believe the Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human liberty.', 'And when the dictator has departed, they can set an example to all the Middle East of a vital and peaceful and self-governing nation.', 'The United States, with other countries, will work to advance liberty and peace in that region.', 'Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but it can come over time.', 'The power and appeal of human liberty is felt in every life and every land.', 'And the greatest power of freedom is to overcome hatred and violence and turn the creative gifts of men and women to the pursuits of peace.', 'That is the future we choose.', 'Free nations have a duty to defend our people by uniting against the violent.', 'And tonight, as we have done before, America and our allies accept that responsibility.', 'Good night, and may God continue to bless America.']","['My', 'fellow', 'citizens', ',',

"Thank you all for coming. It's been my honor to welcome the leadership of the United States Congress here, to welcome them back from the August recess. We talked about a variety of issues—talked about the defense appropriations bill and terrorism insurance and an energy bill, spent most of our time talking about a serious threat to the United States, a serious threat to the world, and that's Saddam Hussein. One of the things I made very clear to the Members here is that doing nothing about that serious threat is not an option for the United States. I also made it very clear that we look forward to a open dialog with Congress and the American people about the threat and that not only will we consult with the United States Congress— ""we"" being the administration—but that my administration will fully participate in any hearings that the Congress wishes to have on this subject, on the subject about how to make America a more secure country, how to best protect the American families in our country. At the appropriate time, this administration will go to the Congress to seek approval for—necessary to deal with the threat. At the same time, I will work with our friends in the world. I've invited Prime Minister Blair to come to Camp David on Saturday, and he'll—he's coming. I've looked forward to talking with him about our mutual concerns about how to make the world more secure and safe. I will see Jean Chretien on Monday, as we—we'll talk about how to make our borders work better, but at the same time, I'll talk to him about this subject. I'll be on the phone to leaders of the—China and Russia and France, and then I'll be giving the speech at the United Nations. Saddam Hussein is a serious threat. He is a significant problem. And it's something that this country must deal with. And today the process starts about how to have an open dialog with the elected officials and, therefore, the American people about our future and how best to deal with it.

"Today Saddam Hussein was executed after receiving a fair trial, the kind of justice he denied the victims of his brutal regime. Fair trials were unimaginable under Saddam Hussein's tyrannical rule. It is a testament to the Iraqi people's resolve to move forward after decades of oppression that, despite his terrible crimes against his own people, Saddam Hussein received a fair trial. This would not have been possible without the Iraqi people's determination to create a society governed by the rule of law. Saddam Hussein's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the Iraqi people and for our troops. Bringing Saddam Hussein to justice will not end the violence in Iraq, but it is an important milestone on Iraq's course to becoming a democracy that can govern, sustain, and defend itself and be an ally in the war on terror. We are reminded today of how far the Iraqi people have come since the end of Saddam Hussein's rule and that the progress they have made would not have been possible without the continued service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform.

"Thank you all very much. Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House. Today we are taking essential action to strengthen the American economy. With my signature, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 will deliver substantial tax relief to 136 million American taxpayers. We are helping workers who need more take-home pay. We're helping seniors who rely on dividends. We're helping small-business owners looking to grow and to create more new jobs. We're helping families with children who will receive immediate relief. By ensuring that Americans have more to spend, to save, and to invest, this legislation is adding fuel to an economic recovery. We have taken aggressive action to strengthen the foundation of our economy so that every American who wants to work will be able to find a job. I want to thank the members of my team who have worked so hard to get this bill to this desk.  I particularly want to thank Secretary John Snow and Secretary Don Evans for their tireless efforts to convince members of both political parties what we're doing today is the right thing to do on behalf of all Americans. I want to thank Steve Friedman for his good work, and his staff. I want to thank Mitch Daniels, ""the Blade.""  I want to thank members of my Cabinet who are here, Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao and Mel Martinez. Thank you both for coming. I particularly want to thank the Members of the United States Congress who worked closely with the administration to do what was right for the American people. Speaker Hastert—Speaker Denny Hastert isn't with us, but he put forth a monumental effort to get this bill done, as did Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. I'm particularly pleased that not only did the majority leader join me up here, but so does the chairman of the Ways and Means, Chairman Bill Thomas. He got the job done along with Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Finance chairman in the Senate. These two good men worked out differences in a quick period of time and got the bill to the respective bodies quickly, where both Republicans and Democrats supported this major piece of legislation. I want to thank the Members from the United States House of Representatives who are with us today as well as Senator Thad Cochran, representing other Members of the Senate. We're honored you all are here. I want to thank all the Members who voted for this bill. We had great support in the House. Senators Miller and Nelson also supported the Republican majority in the Senate, so that we can say loud and clear to the American people, ""You got more of your own money to spend so that this economy can get a good wind behind it."" I want to thank Dirk and members of the Tax Relief Coalition who rallied the grassroots all across the country to remind Members of the House and the Senate that there are people out there that understand that with tax relief will come more jobs for the American people. I appreciate members of the roundtables we had all around America. I see a lot of familiar faces from people that allowed me to come and listen to their stories and then translate those stories into the public arena so that our Congresspeople and citizens knew that behind every number there was a story to be told. I see small-business entrepreneurs and taxpayers and people who need dividends to help with their retirement. All of them stood up as we went around the country and spoke clearly— much more clearly than I can—about the need for tax relief. And I appreciate you all being here. And I want to thank you for your care for our country, and welcome to the White House. The Jobs and Growth Act reduces Federal income taxes across the board. And today the Internal Revenue Service will post new withholding tax tables so that employers can begin leaving more money in the paychecks of American workers, starting next month. The Jobs and Growth Act increases the per-child tax credit from $600 to $1,000. So today I'm directing the Department of Treasury to issue checks of up to $400 per child to 25 million eligible families. And those checks will begin arriving in July. This combination of income-tax rate reductions, a higher child credit, and a reduction in the marriage penalty will make a difference for families in every part of this country. A family of four with a total income of $75,000 will receive a 19-percent reduction in Federal income taxes, saving $1,122 per year, per family. A family of four with an income of $40,000 will see their income taxes drop from $1,178 to $45, a 96-percent tax cut. And under this new law, 3 million individuals and families will have their Federal income-tax liability completely eliminated. Altogether, 34 million families with children, including 6 million single moms, will receive an average tax cut of $1,549 per year. Jenny Theisen, from Omaha, Nebraska, is here with us today. Jenny's husband, David, is a staff sergeant based at Offutt Air Force Base and right now on duty in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Jenny and David work hard to provide for their children, just like a lot of other Americans do as well, and right now Jenny says she tries to save $200 a month for her girls' college savings account. But sometimes other bills have to be paid first, is what she says. Under this proposal, under the bill I sign, it's going to be a lot easier for the Theisen family to save for the future because they will keep an extra $1,300 a year of their own money. Tax relief matters a lot to the average citizen here in America. This tax bill will make it easier for moms and dads to save for their children's education, and that's vitally important for the future of this country. The benefits of the Jobs and Growth Act will also go to investors. The top capital gains tax rate will be reduced by 25 percent, which will encourage more investment and risktaking, and that will help in job creation. The bill also allows for dividend income to be taxed at a lower rate. This will encourage more companies to pay dividends, which in itself will not only be good for investors but will be a corporate reform measure. It's hard to pay dividends unless you've actually got cashflow. The days when people could say, ""Invest with me because the sky's the limit,"" will be changed by dividend policy. It's hard to promote the sky being the limit and pay dividends unless you're actually profitable and have cashflow. Getting—reducing the tax rate on dividends will also increase the wealth effect around America and will help our markets. And the good news is, a lot of senior citizens rely on dividend income to meet their daily needs, and under this legislation, 12 million seniors will receive an average tax reduction of $1,401. We're delivering substantial tax relief to small-business owners and entrepreneurs. Most small-business owners are Subchapter S—own Subchapter S corporations or sole proprietorships or limited partnerships, so the small business pays taxes at the individual tax rate. By cutting individual tax rates and by delivering other incentives for investment in new equipment, 23 million small-business owners will receive an average tax cut of $2,209. This law reflects a commonsense economic principle: The best way to have more jobs is to help the people who create new jobs, and those are the small-business owners of America. Scott Harding is with us today. He's the CEO of a family-owned electrical contracting business in Rockville, Maryland. Scott's company is a Sub S company. He spends more than $100,000 a year on new equipment. His savings under the tax relief will let him keep $7,300 of his own money, and his business will save at least $12,000 because of this legislation's increased expensing rules. His savings, plus those of the other people who own this company, will help this company buy more equipment for their 50 employees, which will make the employees more productive, which will make it more likely that he'll be able to expand the number of employees who works for him. Scott says, ""The more money we make, the bigger bonuses there are for workers. It's that simple."" No matter how complicated tax policy may seem here in Washington, people like Scott understand it all too well. If businesses keep more of their own money, their workers benefit right away. By leaving families and entrepreneurs more to spend, more to save, more to invest, these reforms will help boost the entire economy and create jobs. When people have more money, they can spend it on goods and services. And in our society, when they demand an additional good or a service, somebody will produce the good or a service. And when somebody produces that good or a service, it means somebody is more likely to be able to find a job. Increased hiring happens gradually, but we're on the path to greater job creation across this country. We know that tax relief is going to help this economy because it has done so in the past. The tax relief we passed in 2001 helped make the recession one of the shallowest in American history. It gave millions of families needed relief during a difficult time for our country. It helped many entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams. I recently got a letter from Rusty Loiselle, who lives in Illinois. Rusty had seen some hard times, but he always had a dream to start his own business and to be his own boss. He says the tax relief in 2001 helped him create a small custom painting business. He bought a computer, some airbrushes, lights, and sanders, and he's done well. He's done well enough to be able to buy himself a home for he and his son. He said, ""It probably doesn't sound much like—sound like much to you all, but it means a lot to my son and me."" That's what America's all about, providing opportunity. The bill I'm going to sign provides opportunity for millions of Americans across this country. And the more opportunity there is, the more likely it is somebody is going to find work in this country. This legislation is a major step forward in our economic agenda. Yet other steps are also needed. We must hold Federal spending to a responsible level. Our budget for this year calls for discretionary spending to rise only 4 percent, or as much as the average household income will go up this year. Government should follow the example of American families by setting clear priorities and by staying within them. We must act in other areas to ensure the economic security of American families and workers. There could be no economic security unless people can count on affordable health care. Critical measures before Congress would address this issue. Our country must get a handle on rising health care costs, so we must pass reforms to end the junk lawsuits that drive good doctors out of practice and drive the costs up for everybody. The biggest threat to economic security of our seniors is the affordability of prescription drugs. We must make available a prescription drug benefit to all our seniors. And we must assure that the commitments of Medicare are kept to every future generation of Americans. To enhance economic security for working people throughout the economy, we must reduce the burden of regulation and litigation on small businesses as well. Employers don't want to spend their time and resources filling out forms or fighting junk lawsuits. They want to be out on the shop floor or behind the cash register creating profits and jobs. And that is why this administration has launched a task force to find ways to reduce paperwork for small-business owners in America. We must enact regulatory and lawsuit reforms so that our business owners can do what they do best, create jobs. We must also help build economic security for workers by preparing citizens to fill the new jobs this economy will create. We're aggressively implementing higher standards in our public schools so that every child—every child—learns to read and write and add and subtract. We've increased funding for Pell grants, making higher education a possibility for more young Americans. I've proposed innovative reemployment accounts to help unemployed workers cover the cost of job training or relocation. For those currently unemployed, earlier today I signed legislation extending unemployment insurance benefits for an additional 13 weeks. And when we reauthorize welfare reform, we must make sure that more and more Americans are set on the path of work, which is the path of dignity and independence. I'm confident we can make progress in all these areas, because the Congress is showing the good will and hard work that makes progress possible. Already we've achieved many of the goals that I outlined last January. Congress passed a budget resolution that follows my call to restore spending discipline to Washington, DC. We passed a focused supplemental spending bill to support our brave men and women in uniform. We passed a Global AIDS Initiative to help millions of people fighting for their lives. And now we have passed a bold package of tax relief for America's families and businesses which will help turn our recovery into a lasting expansion that reaches every single corner of America. I believe in the future of this economy, in our Nation, because I know the character of the American people. In 20 months, Americans have been tested by a national emergency, corporate scandals, war, and recession. And time after time, we've responded effectively to the challenges we have faced. Time after time, Americans have shown a firm resolve and an unshakable faith in our future. And now, with this bold legislation, we're sending a clear message to the doubters, the doubters that Washington can respond. We can respond. We can respond in a positive way. We're building on the strengths of our economy so that everybody who wants to work can find a job in this great country. Congratulations to the Members of the United States Congress for rising to the challenge. May God bless America.

american people speaker hastert'speaker denny hastert isn't with us but he put forth a monumental effort to get this bill done as did senate majority leader bill frist i'm particularly pleased that not only did the majority leader join me up here but so does the chairman of the ways and means chairman bill thomas he got the job done along with senator chuck grassley of iowa the finance chairman in the senate these two good men worked out differences in a quick period of time and got the bill to the respective bodies quickly where both republicans and democrats supported this major piece of legislation i want to thank the members from the united states house of representatives who are with us today as well as senator thad cochran representing other members of the senate we're honored you all are here i want to thank all the members who voted for this bill we had great support in the house senators miller and nelson also supported the republican majority in the senate so that we can say loud and clear to the american people you got more of your own money to spend so that this economy can get a good wind behind it i want to thank dirk and members of the tax relief coalition who rallied the grassroots all across the country to remind members of the house and the senate that there are people out there that understand that with tax relief will come more jobs for the american people i appreciate members of the roundtables we had all around america i see a lot of familiar faces from people that allowed me to come and listen to their stories and then translate those stories into the public arena so that our congresspeople and citizens knew that behind every number there was a story to be told i see small business entrepreneurs and taxpayers and people who need dividends to help with their retirement all of them stood up as we went around the country and spoke clearly'much more clearly than i can'about the need for tax relief and i appreciate you all being here and i want to thank you for your care for our country and welcome to the white house the jobs and growth act reduces federal income taxes across the board and today the internal revenue service will post new withholding tax tables so that employers can begin leaving more money in the paychecks of american workers starting next month the jobs and growth act increases the per child tax credit from 600 to 1 000 so today i'm directing the department of treasury to issue checks of up to 400 per child to 25 million eligible families and those checks will begin arriving in july this combination of income tax rate reductions a higher child credit and a reduction in the marriage penalty will make a difference for families in every part of this country a family of four with a total income of 75 000 will receive a 19 percent reduction in federal income taxes saving 1 122 per year per family a family of four with an income of 40 000 will see their income taxes drop from 1 178 to 45 a 96 percent tax cut and under this new law 3 million individuals and families will have their federal income tax liability completely eliminated altogether 34 million families with children including 6 million single moms will receive an average tax cut of 1 549 per year jenny theisen from omaha nebraska is here with us today jenny's husband david is a staff sergeant based at offutt air force base and right now on duty in the pacific and the indian ocean jenny and david work hard to provide for their children just like a lot of other americans do as well and right now jenny says she tries to save 200 a month for her girls' college savings account but sometimes other bills have to be paid first is what she says under this proposal under the bill i sign it's going to be a lot easier for the theisen family to save for the future because they will keep an extra 1 300 a year of their own money tax relief matters a lot to the average citizen here in america this tax bill will make it easier for moms and dads to save for their children's education and that's vitally important for the future of this country the benefits of the jobs and growth act will also go to investors the top capital gains tax rate will be reduced by 25 percent which will encourage more investment and risktaking and that will help in job creation the bill also allows for dividend income to be taxed at a lower rate this will encourage more companies to pay dividends which in itself will not only be good for investors but will be a corporate reform measure it's hard to pay dividends unless you've actually got cashflow the days when people could say invest with me because the sky's the limit will be changed by dividend policy it's hard to promote the sky being the limit and pay dividends unless you're actually profitable and have cashflow getting'reducing the tax rate on dividends will also increase the wealth effect around america and will help our markets and the good news is a lot of senior citizens rely on dividend income to meet their daily needs and under this legislation 12 million seniors will receive an average tax reduction of 1 401 we're delivering substantial tax relief to small business owners and entrepreneurs most small business owners are subchapter s'own subchapter s corporations or sole proprietorships or limited partnerships so the small business pays taxes at the individual tax rate by cutting individual tax rates and by delivering other incentives for investment in new equipment 23 million small business owners will receive an average tax cut of 2 209 this law reflects a commonsense economic principle the best way to have more jobs is to help the people who create new jobs and those are the small business owners of america scott harding is with us today he's the ceo of a family owned electrical contracting business in rockville maryland scott's company is a sub s company he spends more than 100 000 a year on new equipment his savings under the tax relief will let him keep 7 300 of his own money and his business will save at least 12 000 because of this legislation's increased expensing rules his savings plus those of the other people who own

us, but he put forth a monumental effort to get this bill done, as did Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist."", ""I'm particularly pleased that not only did the majority leader join me up here, but so does the chairman of the Ways and Means, Chairman Bill Thomas."", 'He got the job done along with Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Finance chairman in the Senate.', 'These two good men worked out differences in a quick period of time and got the bill to the respective bodies quickly, where both Republicans and Democrats supported this major piece of legislation.', 'I want to thank the Members from the United States House of Representatives who are with us today as well as Senator Thad Cochran, representing other Members of the Senate.', ""We're honored you all are here."", 'I want to thank all the Members who voted for this bill.', 'We had great support in the House.', 'Senators Miller and Nelson also supported the Republican majority in the Senate, so that we can say loud and clear to the American people, ""You got more of your own money to spend so that this economy can get a good wind behind it.""', 'I want to thank Dirk and members of the Tax Relief Coalition who rallied the grassroots all across the country to remind Members of the House and the Senate that there are people out there that understand that with tax relief will come more jobs for the American people.', 'I appreciate members of the roundtables we had all around America.', 'I see a lot of familiar faces from people that allowed me to come and listen to their stories and then translate those stories into the public arena so that our Congresspeople and citizens knew that behind every number there was a story to be told.', 'I see small-business entrepreneurs and taxpayers and people who need dividends to help with their retirement.', 'All of them stood up as we went around the country and spoke clearly— much more clearly than I can—about the need for tax relief.', 'And I appreciate you all being here.', 'And I want to thank you for your care for our country, and welcome to the White House.', 'The Jobs and Growth Act reduces Federal income taxes across the board.', 'And today the Internal Revenue Service will post new withholding tax tables so that employers can begin leaving more money in the paychecks of American workers, starting next month.', 'The Jobs and Growth Act increases the per-child tax credit from $600 to $1,000.', ""So today I'm directing the Department of Treasury to issue checks of up to $400 per child to 25 million eligible families."", 'And those checks will begin arriving in July.', 'This combination of income-tax rate reductions, a higher child credit, and a reduction in the marriage penalty will make a difference for families in every part of this country.', 'A family of four with a total income of $75,000 will receive a 19-percent reduction in Federal income taxes, saving $1,122 per year, per family.', 'A family of four with an income of $40,000 will see their income taxes drop from $1,178 to $45, a 96-percent tax cut.', 'And under this new law, 3 million individuals and families will have their Federal income-tax liability completely eliminated.', 'Altogether, 34 million families with children, including 6 million single moms, will receive an average tax cut of $1,549 per year.', 'Jenny Theisen, from Omaha, Nebraska, is here with us today.', ""Jenny's husband, David, is a staff sergeant based at Offutt Air Force Base and right now on duty in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean."", ""Jenny and David work hard to provide for their children, just like a lot of other Americans do as well, and right now Jenny says she tries to save $200 a month for her girls' college savings account."", 'But sometimes other bills have to be paid first, is what she says.', ""Under this proposal, under the bill I sign, it's going to be a lot easier for the Theisen family to save for the future because they will keep an extra $1,300 a year of their own money."", 'Tax relief matters a lot to the average citizen here in America.', ""This tax bill will make it easier for moms and dads to save for their children's education, and that's vitally important for the future of this country."", 'The benefits of the Jobs and Growth Act will also go to investors.', 'The top capital gains tax rate will be reduced by 25 percent, which will encourage more investment and risktaking, and that will help in job creation.', 'The bill also allows for dividend income to be taxed at a lower rate.', 'This will encourage more companies to pay dividends, which in itself will not only be good for investors but will be a corporate reform measure.', ""It's hard to pay dividends unless you've actually got cashflow."", 'The days when people could say, ""Invest with me because the sky\'s the limit,"" will be changed by dividend policy.', ""It's hard to promote the sky being the limit and pay dividends unless you're actually profitable and have cashflow."", 'Getting—reducing the tax rate on dividends will also increase the wealth effect around America and will help our markets.', 'And the good news is, a lot of senior citizens rely on dividend income to meet their daily needs, and under this legislation, 12 million seniors will receive an average tax reduction of $1,401.', ""We're delivering substantial tax relief to small-business owners and entrepreneurs."", 'Most small-business owners are Subchapter S—own Subchapter S corporations or sole proprietorships or limited partnerships, so the small business pays taxes at the individual tax rate.', 'By cutting individual tax rates and by delivering other incentives for investment in new equipment, 23 million small-business owners will receive an average tax cut of $2,209.', 'This law reflects a commonsense economic principle: The best way to have more jobs is to help the people who create new jobs, and those are the small-business owners of America.', 'Scott Harding is with us today.', ""He's the CEO of a family-owned electrical contracting business in Rockville, Maryland."", ""Scott's company is a Sub S company."", 'He spends more than $100,000 a year on new equipment.', ""His savings under the tax relief will let him keep $7,300 of his own money, and his business will save at least $12,000 because of this legislation's increased expensing rules."", ""His savings, plus those of the other people who own this company, will help this company buy more equipment for their 50 employees, which will make the employees more productive, which will make it more likely that he'll be able to expand the number of employees who works for him."", 'Scott says, ""The more money we make, the bigger bonuses there are for workers.', 'It\'s that simple.""', 'No matter how complicated tax policy may seem here in Washington, people like Scott understand it all too well.', 'If businesses keep more of their own money, their workers benefit right away.', 'By leaving families and entrepreneurs more to spend, more to save, more to invest, these reforms will help boost the entire economy and create jobs.', 'When people have more money, they can spend it on goods and services.', 'And in our society, when they demand an additional good or a service, somebody will produce the good or a service.', 'And when somebody produces that good or a service, it means somebody is more likely to be able to find a job.', ""Increased hiring happens gradually, but we're on the path to greater job creation across this country."", 'We know that tax relief is going to help this economy because it has done so in the past.', 'The tax relief we passed in 2001 helped make the recession one of the shallowest in American history.', 'It gave millions of families needed relief during a difficult time for our country.', 'It helped many entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams.', 'I recently got a letter from Rusty Loiselle, who lives in Illinois.', 'Rusty had seen some hard times, but he always had a dream to start his own business and to be his own boss.', 'He says the tax relief in 2001 helped him create a small custom painting business.', ""He bought a computer, some airbrushes, lights, and sanders, and he's done well."", ""He's done well enough to be able to buy himself a home for he and his son."", 'He said, ""It probably doesn\'t sound much like—sound like much to you all, but it means a lot to my son and me.""', ""That's what America's all about, providing opportunity."", ""The bill I'm going to sign provides opportunity for millions of Americans across this country."", 'And the more opportunity there is, the more likely it is somebody is going to find work in this country.', 'This legislation is a major step forward in our economic agenda.', 'Yet other steps are also needed.', 'We must hold Federal spending to a responsible level.', 'Our budget for this year calls for discretionary spending to rise only 4 percent, or as much as the average household income will go up this year.', 'Government should follow the example of American families by setting clear priorities and by staying within them.', 'We must act in other areas to ensure the economic security of American families and workers.', 'There could be no economic security unless people can count on affordable health care.', 'Critical measures before Congress would address this issue.', 'Our country must get a handle on rising health care costs, so we must pass reforms to end the junk lawsuits that drive good doctors out of practice and drive the costs up for everybody.', 'The biggest threat to economic security of our seniors is the affordability of prescription drugs.', 'We must make available a prescription drug benefit to all our seniors.', 'And we must assure that the commitments of Medicare are kept to every future generation of Americans.', 'To enhance economic security for working people throughout the economy, we must reduce the burden of regulation and litigation on small businesses as well.', ""Employers don't want to spend their time and resources filling out forms or fighting junk lawsuits."", 'They want to be out on the shop floor or behind the cash register creating profits and jobs.', 'And that is why this administration has launched a task force to find ways to reduce paperwork for small-business owners in America.', 'We must enact regulatory and lawsuit reforms so that our business owners can do what they do best, create jobs.', 'We must also help build economic security for workers by preparing citizens to fill the new jobs this economy will create.', ""We're aggressively implementing higher standards in our public schools so that every child—every child—learns to read and write and add and subtract."", ""We've increased funding for Pell grants, making higher education a possibility for more young Americans."", ""I've proposed innovative reemployment accounts to help unemployed workers cover the cost of job training or relocation."", 'For those currently unemployed, earlier today I signed legislation extending unemployment insurance benefits for an additional 13 weeks.', 'And when we reauthorize welfare reform, we must make sure that more and more Americans are set on the path of work, which is the path of dignity and independence.', ""I'm confident we can make progress in all these areas, because the Congress is showing the good will and hard work that makes progress possible."", ""Already we've achieved many of the goals that I outlined last January."", 'Congress passed a budget resolution that follows my call to restore spending discipline to Washington, DC.', 'We passed a focused supplemental spending bill to support our brave men and women in uniform.', 'We passed a Global AIDS Initiative to help millions of people fighting for their lives.', ""And now we have passed a bold package of tax relief for America's families and businesses which will help turn our recovery into a lasting expansion that reaches every single corner of America."", 'I believe in the future of this economy, in our Nation, because I know the character of the American people.', 'In 20 months, Americans have been tested by a national emergency, corporate scandals, war, and recession.', ""And time after time, we've responded effectively to the challenges we have faced."", 'Time after time, Americans have shown a firm resolve and an unshakable faith in our future.', ""And now, with this bold legislation, we're sending a clear message to the doubters, the doubters that Washington can respond."", 'We can respond.', 'We can respond in a positive way.', ""We're building on the strengths of our economy so that everybody who wants to work can find a job in this great country."", 'Congratulations to the

"Good evening. Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes or in their offices: secretaries, business men and women, military and Federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our Nation into chaos and retreat, but they have failed. Our country is strong. A great people has been moved to defend a great nation. Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shattered steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining. Today our Nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature. And we responded with the best of America, with the daring of our rescueworkers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood and help in any way they could. Immediately following the first attack, I implemented our Government's emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it's prepared. Our emergency teams are working in New York City and Washington, DC, to help with local rescue efforts. Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the world from further attacks. The functions of our Government continue without interruption. Federal agencies in Washington which had to be evacuated today are reopening for essential personnel tonight and will be open for business tomorrow. Our financial institutions remain strong, and the American economy will be open for business as well. The search is underway for those who are behind these evil acts. I've directed the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them. I appreciate so very much the Members of Congress who have joined me in strongly condemning these attacks. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the many world leaders who have called to offer their condolences and assistance. America and our friends and allies join with all those who want peace and security in the world, and we stand together to win the war against terrorism. Tonight I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve, for the children whose worlds have been shattered, for all whose sense of safety and security has been threatened. And I pray they will be comforted by a power greater than any of us, spoken through the ages in Psalm 23: ""Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me."" This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. America has stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time. None of us will ever forget this day. Yet, we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world. Thank you. Good night, and God bless America.

"Thank you all. Please be seated. Yesterday I pledged to reach out to the whole Nation, and today I'm proving that I'm willing to reach out to everybody by including the White House press corps.  This week the voters of America set the direction of our Nation for the next 4 years. I'm honored by the support of my fellow citizens, and I'm ready for the job. We are fighting a continuing war on terror, and every American has a stake in the outcome of this war. Republicans, Democrats, and independents all love our country, and together we'll protect the American people. We will preserve—we will persevere until the enemy is defeated. We will stay strong and resolute. We have a duty, a solemn duty to protect the American people, and we will. Every civilized country also has a stake in the outcome of this war. Whatever our past disagreements, we share a common enemy, and we have common duties to protect our peoples, to confront disease and hunger and poverty in troubled regions of the world. I'll continue to reach out to our friends and allies, our partners in the EU and NATO, to promote development and progress, to defeat the terrorists, and to encourage freedom and democracy as alternatives to tyranny and terror. I also look forward to working with the present Congress and the new Congress that will arrive in January. I congratulate the men and women who have just been elected to the House and the Senate. I will join with old friends and new friends to make progress for all Americans. Congress will return later this month to finish this current session. I urge Members to pass the appropriations bill that remain, showing spending discipline while focusing on our Nation's priorities. Our Government also needs the very best intelligence, especially in a time of war. So I urge the Congress to pass an effective intelligence reform bill that I can sign into law. The new Congress that begins its work next year will have serious responsibilities and historic opportunities. To accelerate the momentum of this economy and to keep creating jobs, we must take practical measures to help our job creators, the entrepreneurs and the small-business owners. We must confront the frivolous lawsuits that are driving up the cost of health care and hurting doctors and patients. We must continue the work of education reform to bring high standards and accountability not just to our elementary and secondary schools but to our high schools as well. We must reform our complicated and outdated Tax Code. We need to get rid of the needless paperwork that makes our economy—that is a drag on our economy, to make sure our economy is the most competitive in the world. We must show our leadership by strengthening Social Security for our children and our grandchildren. This is more than a problem to be solved. It is an opportunity to help millions of our fellow citizens find security and independence that comes from owning something, from ownership. In the election of 2004, large issues were set before our country. They were discussed every day on the campaign. With the campaign over, Americans are expecting a bipartisan effort and results. I'll reach out to everyone who shares our goals. And I'm eager to start the work ahead. I'm looking forward to serving this country for 4 more years. I want to thank you all for your hard work in the campaign. I told you that the other day, and you probably thought I was just seeking votes.  But now that you voted, I really meant it. I appreciate the hard work of the press corps. We all put in long hours, and you're away from your families for a long period of time. But the country is better off when we have a vigorous and free press covering our elections. And thanks for your work.

"President Bush. It's my honor to welcome the President of our very close ally to the Oval Office. I'll have a statement; the President will have a statement. Then I'll answer two questions from the American press. I first want to express my country's deepest condolences for the accident that took place, where a U.S. military vehicle killed a Korean woman. And we send our deepest sympathies to the woman's families. And, Mr. President, I just want you to know our heart—our hearts are sad as a result of this incident. The President and I had a very long discussion about very important issues. And we'll continue this discussion over lunch. And the reason why we've had a serious discussion on important issues is because we're strategic partners and allies and friends. I appreciate the President's good advice, and we share the same goals, peace on the Korean Peninsula and peace throughout the world. We share the same goals: We want our peoples to grow up in a peaceful society that's a prosperous society. And so, Mr. President, welcome. Thank you for coming, and thank you for your friendship. President Roh. I thank you for your warm welcome, and I also thank you for the opportunity for us to engage in extensive discussions on various issues. I also thank you, Mr. President, for your warm message of condolence regarding the unfortunate incident involving U.S. forces Korea. This is my fourth meeting with you, Mr. President, and my second visit to the United States. And every time we meet together, Mr. President, questions abound regarding the possible existence of differences between Korea and the United States surrounding the North Korea nuclear issue. But every time I meet you, Mr. President, in person, I come to the realization that there indeed is no difference between our two sides with regard to the basic principles. In fact, we're in full and perfect agreement on the basic principles. And whatever problem arises in the course of our negotiations and talks, we will be able to work them out under close consultations. There are, admittedly, many people who worry about potential discord or cacophony between the two powers of the alliance. But after going through our discussion today, Mr. President, I realize once again that with regard to all the matters and all the issues of great importance, we were able to deal with them and we were able to bring closure to them smoothly. And I am very certain that our alliance remains solid and will continue to remain solid and staunch in the future as well. To be sure, there are one or two minor issues, but I'm also quite certain that we will be able to work them out very smoothly through dialog in the period ahead. How do you feel, Mr. President? Wouldn't you agree that the alliance is strong and everything is working—— President Bush. I would say the alliance is very strong, Mr. President. And I want to thank you for your frank assessment of the situation on the Peninsula. And I'm looking forward to having lunch with you. I'm hungry, like you are.

"STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY  (House) The Administration strongly supports and urges swift House passage of H.R. 1424. This legislation is the product of extensive bipartisan work to craft an expeditious response to a crisis in the Nation's financial markets. Along with a greatly needed tax package, expansion of deposit insurance, and important mental health parity legislation, the bill would, among other accomplishments, spare approximately 26 million Americans from a tax increase in the form of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Passage of H.R. 1424 is of tremendous importance to all Americans. If the financial markets fail to function, American families will face great difficulty in getting loans to purchase a home, buy a family car, or finance a child's education. Businesses, too, will be unable to attract the credit they need to retain and create jobs. Even during the period that Congress has considered such legislation, there have been rapidly accumulating examples of businesses, State and local governments, and families all across America forced to constrain their planned activities because of a lack of access to the capital that they require to meet obligations, grow their businesses, and satisfy family priorities. H.R. 1424 would enable the Department of the Treasury, operating under appropriate oversight established in the legislation, to remove troubled assets that are currently clogging our financial system and inhibiting the flow of capital. Because the vast majority of Americans responsibly pay their mortgages, the Administration expects that much, if not all, of the amounts provided for in this legislation to buy or insure these assets will ultimately be recouped. For this reason, the true ""cost"" of this legislation should be far less than $700 billion. Even so, a commitment of taxpayer resources of such a magnitude requires many safeguards. The legislation thus contains several provisions, agreed to jointly by Congressional leaders and the Administration, to ensure appropriate oversight over this process and to ensure that taxpayer resources are not used to finance windfalls for irresponsible corporate executives. The negotiations conducted to improve this package also resulted in the addition of several further provisions to protect taxpayers, including provisions for an equity interest when appropriate in institutions receiving assistance and the creation of a program to guarantee troubled mortgage assets at no cost to taxpayers as an alternative to direct purchases. H.R. 1424 also includes a provision to temporarily increase to $250,000 the amount of deposit insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration. No American has ever lost deposits that are insured by these organizations, and this will not change. The provisions in this legislation permit the deposit insurance agencies to deliver increased protection and confidence during a time of financial market turbulence. The Administration supports this extension of deposit insurance and believes it will further Americans' long-standing and justified confidence in the security of their bank deposits. H.R. 1424 also contains provisions to protect millions of taxpayers from a tax increase through the Alternative Minimum Tax, extend tax relief for individuals and tax incentives for businesses that the Administration has strongly supported, and create and extend a number of incentives for renewable energy. Extending current law by enacting this legislation is vital for businesses and individuals who expect consistency and predictability in the tax code. Further delay in implementation of these measures risks serious disruption of the upcoming individual tax filing season and invites the very real possibility that these important provisions will be allowed to expire, which could potentially delay tax refunds for American families, and have a substantial negative effect on corporate financial statements. The Administration believes this legislation should be passed as quickly as possible to facilitate prompt signing into law. A strong bipartisan showing in support of the legislation will send an important, helpful signal to markets here and abroad that the Federal government will take the actions necessary to get our financial system back on track. These measures will better enable our Nation's economy to mitigate a substantial near-term risk, to smooth and accelerate its recovery from a financial market shock, and to demonstrate once again its resilience and underlying strength.",statement-administration-policy-hr-1424-emergency-economic-stabilization-act-2008-energy.txt,64,statement of administration policy house the administration

"Thank you all. Sit down. Thank you all very much. Thanks for coming. Thanks for the warm welcome. I'm pleased to be joined by leaders of both parties to enact an economic growth package on behalf of the American people. You know, a lot of folks in America probably were saying that it's impossible for those of us in Washington to find common ground, to reach compromise on important issues. I didn't feel that way; I know the leaders didn't feel that way. And as a result, we have come together on a single mission, and that is to put the people's interests first. And I really do welcome the Members of Congress, and I thank you for your hard work. Madame Speaker, I thank you for your leadership. Senator Reid, I thank you for your leadership as well. I appreciate very much the fact that the Vice President has joined us, along with Congressman Boehner, Congressman Hoyer, Senator Mitch McConnell, Congressman Roy Blunt, Congressman Jim Clyburn, and other Members of the House and the Senate. You're welcome here in the people's house any time. I'm very grateful that members of my Cabinet have joined us. Secretary Paulson was the leader in the negotiations on this, and I thank you very much for your hard work, Mr. Secretary. You're earning your pay.  Appreciate other members of my Cabinet who have joined us as well. You know, I know a lot of Americans are concerned about our economic future. Our overall economy has grown for 6 straight years, but that growth has clearly slowed. And so in January, I—we had an important phone call with the leaders of the Congress to talk about whether or not we could come together to provide a booster shot for our economy: a package that is robust, temporary, and puts money back into the hands of American workers and businesses. Congress passed a really good piece of legislation, and they did so in a very expeditious manner. The bill I'm signing today is large enough to have an impact, amounting to more than $152 billion this year, or about 1 percent of GDP. The bill provides temporary tax incentives for businesses to make investments in their companies so that we create new jobs this year. The bill provides individual tax relief in the form of tax rebates. These rebates will amount to as much as $600 for individuals and $1,200 for married couples, with additional rebates for families with children. The Members resisted the temptation to load up this bill with unrelated programs or unnecessary spending, and I appreciate that. I thank the Members for acting quickly. I thank them for acting to provide immediate tax relief to the American people. There are other ways we can work together to help our economy through this rough patch. I know many Americans are worried about meeting their mortgages. My administration is working to address this problem. Last fall, for example, we brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. Yesterday Secretaries Paulson and Jackson joined HOPE NOW in announcing what is called Project Lifeline. It's a targeted outreach effort to help more at-risk homeowners. Congress can also help by passing legislation to reform the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and to allow State housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. I hope that Congress can act on these matters quickly. Helping our economy requires us to take action. It is equally important that we not overreact. Our economic success is not the result of the wisdom of politicians in Washington, DC, but of the collective wisdom of the American people. Shopkeepers, farmers, laborers, entrepreneurs in the private sector have given us the most—the strongest and most resilient economic system in the world. Over the past 7 years, this system has absorbed shocks: recession, corporate scandals, terrorist attacks, global war. Yet the genius of our system is that it can absorb such shocks and emerge even stronger. In a dynamic market economy, there will always be times when we experience uncertainties and fluctuations. But so long as we pursue progrowth policies that put faith in the American people, our economy will prosper, and it will continue to be the marvel of the world. Now I'm honored to sign the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008.

"Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, fellow citizens: As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of Government share a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq. Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our Nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world. Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our Nation an active force for good in the world, the state of our Union is confident and strong. Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror—or a lot of gray— —and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of their Union? Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren. First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. America's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. In the past 4 years, we've provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history. And in the last year alone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the Congress delivered, and the Nation is grateful. Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world. America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the Federal Government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 Government programs that are not getting results or duplicate current efforts or do not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely or not at all. To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand better results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. We will help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job training system and strengthening America's community colleges. And we'll make it easier for Americans to afford a college education by increasing the size of Pell grants. To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job-creators from junk lawsuits. Justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos claims, and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year. To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control over their health decisions. I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need. To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy. Nearly 4 years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home, including safe, clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies legislation will cut powerplant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology, from hydrogen-fueled cars to clean coal to renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough. I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on foreign energy. All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs, but they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time. Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent Federal Tax Code. I've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the Tax Code from top to bottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this Nation a Tax Code that is progrowth, easy to understand, and fair to all. America's immigration system is also outdated, unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country. We should not be content with laws that punish hard-working people who want only to provide for their families and deny businesses willing workers and invite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary-guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists. One of America's most important institutions, a symbol of the trust between generations, is also in need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century. The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security. Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement. And for them the system is sound and fiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you; for you, the Social Security system will not change in any way. For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago for a very different era. In those days, people did not live as long. Benefits were much lower than they are today. And a half century ago, about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits. Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and, therefore, drawing benefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about 3 workers. And over the next few decades, that number will fall to just 2 workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees. So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. For example, in the year 2027, the Government will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion to keep the system afloat, and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than $300 billion. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in Social Security benefits or other Government programs. I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates are not so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a 5-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their twenties, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter. And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress. You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all. Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated. All these ideas are on the table. I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics. I will work with Members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. I will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer. We must, however, be guided by some basic principles. We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day. We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes. We must ensure that lower income Americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement. We must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement. And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future. As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts. Here is how the idea works. Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees. If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future. Here's why the personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will grow over time at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver, and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and—or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the Government can never take it away. The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts. We'll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement. We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once but rather paid out over time as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts. Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to Federal employees, because you already have something similar called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based investment funds. It's time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young Americans. Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children. Government is not the source of these values, but Government should never undermine them. Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be redefined by activist judges. For the good of families, children, and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage. Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us reach that goal by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities, and I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others. We should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity. America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical. Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well-qualified to serve on the bench, and I have done so. The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down vote. Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our Government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy or gangs or jail. Tonight I propose a 3-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders in programs ranging from literacy to sports. And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush. Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases, African American men and women. Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In America, we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit, so we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund spec
ial training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side. Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger and protected by peace.We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy, and chief among them is freedom from fear. In the 3 1/2 years since September the 11th, 2001, we have taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created a new department of Government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more than a half million first-responders. Police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all. Our Nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. The Al Qaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction but no longer without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many and intimidate us all, and we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won. Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror, and I thank the Congress for providing our service men and women with the resources they have needed. During this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory. Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a mission to help train Iraqi officers. We're cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. We're working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries have captured or detained Al Qaida terrorists. In the next 4 years, my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time. In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades. The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force of human freedom. Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the ""evil principle"" of democracy. And we've declared our own intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else. That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their own cultures. And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace. That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by women voting in Afghanistan and Palestinians choosing a new direction and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a President. We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty, and in the coming years, we will add to that story. The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian Territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure. Tomorrow morning Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state. To promote this democracy, I will ask Congress for $350 million to support Palestinian political, economic, and security reforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace is within reach, and America will help them achieve that goal. To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The Government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East. To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. Syria still allows its territory and parts of Lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region. You have passed and we are applying the Syrian Accountability Act, and we expect the Syrian Government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom. Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror, pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror. And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you. Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq so we do not have to face them here at home. And the victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren. We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new Transitional National Assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She said, ""Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me: The insurgents are weak; they are afraid of democracy; they are losing. So I got my husband and I got my parents, and we all came out and voted together."" Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility. For millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all. One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail. She says of her country, ""We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American people who paid the cost but, most of all, to the soldiers."" Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country, and we are honored that she is with us tonight. The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and will continue to attack it. Yet the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces; they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people. We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September, ""Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible."" That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq. The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country. At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground and in consultation with the Iraqi Government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces, forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure. As those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend their own country, and we will help that proud new nation secure its liberty. Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, ""Tell America not to abandon us."" He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come. We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result, a country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned. Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment, and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud. The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they're making our Nation more secure. Some of our service men and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover. And we have said farewell to some very good men and women who died for our freedom and whose memory this Nation will honor forever. One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a marine and how proud he was to be on the frontline against terror. She wrote, ""When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.""' Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts we honor freedom's defenders and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood. In these 4 years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We have known times of sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory. In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us. The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world. We are all part of a great venture: To extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom brings. As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, ""Each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth."" And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was only a dream until it was fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream until it was achieved. The fall of imperial communism was only a dream until, one day, it was accomplished. Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. The road of providence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom. Thank you, and may God bless America.

branches of government share a great privilege we've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve and tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of afghanistan the palestinian territories ukraine and a free and sovereign iraq two weeks ago i stood on the steps of this capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all this evening i will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world tonight with a healthy growing economy with more americans going back to work with our nation an active force for good in the world the state of our union is confident and strong our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity by advances in medicine by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice now as we see a little gray in the mirror'or a lot of gray''and we watch our children moving into adulthood we ask the question what will be the state of their union members of congress the choices we make together will answer that question over the next several months on issue after issue let us do what americans have always done and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren first we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely america's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation in the past 4 years we've provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes overcome a recession opened up new markets abroad prosecuted corporate criminals raised homeownership to its highest level in history and in the last year alone the united states has added 2 3 million new jobs when action was needed the congress delivered and the nation is grateful now we must add to these achievements by making our economy more flexible more innovative and more competitive we will keep america the economic leader of the world america's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government i welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline i will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation makes tax relief permanent and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009 my budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results or duplicate current efforts or do not fulfill essential priorities the principle here is clear taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely or not at all to make our economy stronger and more dynamic we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century under the no child left behind act standards are higher test scores are on the rise and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students now we must demand better results from our high schools so every high school diploma is a ticket to success we will help an additional 200 000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job training system and strengthening america's community colleges and we'll make it easier for americans to afford a college education by increasing the size of pell grants to make our economy stronger and more competitive america must reward not punish the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs small business is the path of advancement especially for women and minorities so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job creators from junk lawsuits justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos claims and i urge congress to pass legal reforms this year to make our economy stronger and more productive we must make health care more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control over their health decisions i ask congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low income workers buy insurance a community health center in every poor county improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs association health plans for small businesses and their employees expanded health savings accounts and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need to keep our economy growing we also need reliable supplies of affordable environmentally responsible energy nearly 4 years ago i submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation alternative sources a modernized electricity grid and more production here at home including safe clean nuclear energy my clear skies legislation will cut powerplant pollution and improve the health of our citizens and my budget provides strong funding for leading edge technology from hydrogen fueled cars to clean coal to renewable sources such as ethanol four years of debate is enough i urge congress to pass legislation that makes america more secure and less dependent on foreign energy all these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs but they are just the beginning of our duty to build the prosperity of future generations we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time year after year americans are burdened by an archaic incoherent federal tax code i've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom and when their recommendations are delivered you and i will work together to give this nation a tax code that is progrowth easy to understand and fair to all america's immigration system is also outdated unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country we should not be content with laws that punish hard working people who want only to provide for their families and deny businesses willing workers and invite chaos at our border it is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs americans will not take that rejects amnesty that tells us who is entering and leaving our country and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists one of america's most important institutions a symbol of the trust between generations is also in need of wise and effective reform social security was a great moral success of the 20th century and we must honor its great purposes in this new century the system however on its current path is headed toward bankruptcy and so we must join together to strengthen and save social security today more than 45 million americans receive social security benefits and millions more are nearing retirement and for them the system is sound and fiscally strong i have a message for every american who is 55 or older do not let anyone mislead you for you the social security system will not change in any way for younger workers the social security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time social security was created decades ago for a very different era in those days people did not live as long benefits were much lower than they are today and a half century ago about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits our society has changed in ways the founders of social security could not have foreseen in today's world people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer and those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades and instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary right now it's only about 3 workers and over the next few decades that number will fall to just 2 workers per beneficiary with each passing year fewer workers are paying ever higher benefits to an ever larger number of retirees so here is the result thirteen years from now in 2018 social security will be paying out more than it takes in and every year afterward will bring a new shortfall bigger than the year before for example in the year 2027 the government will somehow have to come up with an extra 200 billion to keep the system afloat and by 2033 the annual shortfall would be more than 300 billion by the year 2042 the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt if steps are not taken to avert that outcome the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes massive new borrowing or sudden and severe cuts in social security benefits or other government programs i recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off but those dates are not so distant as any parent will tell you if you have a 5 year old you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road if you've got children in their twenties as some of us do the idea of social security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter and it should not be a small matter to the united states congress you and i share a responsibility we must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of social security once and for all fixing social security permanently will require an open candid review of the options some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees former congressman tim penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages during the 1990s my predecessor president clinton spoke of increasing the retirement age former senator john breaux suggested discouraging early collection of social security benefits the late senator daniel patrick moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated all these ideas are on the table i know that none of these reforms would be easy but we have to move ahead with courage and honesty because our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics i will work with members of congress to find the most effective combination of reforms i will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer we must however be guided by some basic principles we must make social security permanently sound not leave that task for another day we must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes we must ensure that lower income americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement we must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement and we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future as we fix social security we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers and the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts here is how the idea works right now a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the social security benefits of today's retirees if you're a younger worker i believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account so you can build a nest egg for your own future here's why the personal accounts are a better deal your money will grow over time at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from social security in addition you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account if you wish to your children and'or grandchildren and best of all the money in the account is yours and the government can never take it away the goal here is greater security in retirement so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts we'll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds we'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden wall street fees we'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement we'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once but rather paid out over time as an addition to traditional social security benefits and we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees because you already have something similar called the thrift savings plan which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based investment funds it's time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young americans our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society so many of my generation after a long journey have come home to family and faith and are determined to bring up responsible moral children government is not the source of these values but government should never undermine them because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society it should not be redefined by activist judges for the good of families children and society i support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable we must strive to build a culture of life medical research can help us reach that goal by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities and i thank the congress for doubling the funding of the national institutes of health to build a culture of life we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others we should all be able to agree on some clear standards i will work with congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity america will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious aggressive and always ethical because courts must always deliver impartial justice judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law not legislate from the bench as president i have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well qualified to serve on the bench and i have done so the constitution also gives the senate a responsibility every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of america our government will continue to support faith based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places now we need to focus on giving young people especially young men in our cities better options than apathy or gangs or jail tonight i propose a 3 year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at risk youth which involves parents and pastors coaches and community leaders in programs ranging from literacy to sports and i am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our first lady laura bush because hiv aids brings suffering and fear into so many lives i ask you to reauthorize the ryan white act to encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease and as we update this important law we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases african american men and women because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice we need to make sure americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice in america we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit so we are dramatically expanding the use of dna evidence to prevent wrongful conviction soon i will send to congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an america that is safe from danger and protected by peace we will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy and chief among them is freedom from fear in the 3 1 2 years since september the 11th 2001 we have taken unprecedented actions to protect americans we've created a new department of government to defend our homeland focused the fbi on preventing terrorism begun to reform our intelligence agencies broken up terror cells across the country expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack improved border security and trained more than a half million first responders police and firefighters air marshals researchers and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer and we thank them all our nation working with allies and friends has also confronted the enemy abroad with measures that are determined successful and continuing the al qaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders but many of its top commanders have been removed there are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists but their number has declined there are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction but no longer without attention and without consequence our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many and intimidate us all and we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror and i thank the congress for providing our service men and women with the resources they have needed during this time of war we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory other nations around the globe have stood with us in afghanistan an international force is helping provide security in iraq 28 countries have troops on the ground the united nations and the european union provided technical assistance for the elections and nato is leading a mission to help train iraqi officers we're cooperating with 60 governments in the proliferation security initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials we're working closely with the governments in asia to convince north korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions pakistan saudi arabia and nine other countries have captured or detained al qaida terrorists in the next 4 years my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time in the long term the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder if whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred they will be the recruiting grounds for terror and that terror will stalk america and other free nations for decades the only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force of human freedom our enemies know this and that is why the terrorist zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the evil principle of democracy and we've declared our own intention america will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the middle east and beyond with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world the united states has no right no desire and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else that is one of the main differences between us and our enemies they seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression in which a tiny group of brutal self appointed rulers control every aspect of every life our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their own cultures and because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors the advance of freedom will lead to peace that advance has great momentum in our time shown by women voting in afghanistan and palestinians choosing a new direction and the people of ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president we are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty and in the coming years we will add to that story the beginnings of reform and democracy in the palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure tomorrow morning secretary of state rice departs on a trip that will take her to israel and the west bank for meetings with prime minister sharon and president abbas she will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful independent democratic state to promote this democracy i will ask congress for 350 million to support palestinian political economic and security reforms the goal of two democratic states israel and palestine living side by side in peace is within reach and america will help them achieve that goal to promote peace and stability in the broader middle east the united states will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror while we encourage a higher standard of freedom hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from morocco to jordan to bahrain the government of saudi arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future and the great and proud nation of egypt which showed the way toward peace in the middle east can now show the way toward democracy in the middle east to promote peace in the broader middle east we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder syria still allows its territory and parts of lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region you have passed and we are applying the syrian accountability act and we expect the syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom today iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve we are working with european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror and to the iranian people i say tonight as you stand for your own liberty america stands with you our generational commitment to the advance of freedom especially in the middle east is now being tested and honored in iraq that country is a vital front in the war on terror which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in iraq so we do not have to face them here at home and the victory of freedom in iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror inspire democratic reformers from damascus to tehran bring more hope and progress to a troubled region and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren we will succeed because the iraqi people value their own liberty as they showed the world last sunday across iraq often at great risk millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new transitional national assembly a young woman in baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire

fellow citizens: As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of Government share a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve."", 'And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq.', 'Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our Nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all.', 'This evening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.', 'Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our Nation an active force for good in the world, the state of our Union is confident and strong.', ""Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice."", 'Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror—or a lot of gray— —and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of their Union?', 'Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question.', 'Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren.', 'First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely.', ""America's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation."", ""In the past 4 years, we've provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history."", 'And in the last year alone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs.', 'When action was needed, the Congress delivered, and the Nation is grateful.', 'Now we must add to these achievements.', 'By making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world.', ""America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the Federal Government."", 'I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline.', 'I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009.', 'My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 Government programs that are not getting results or duplicate current efforts or do not fulfill essential priorities.', 'The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely or not at all.', 'To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century.', ""Under the No Child Left Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students."", 'Now we must demand better results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success.', ""We will help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job training system and strengthening America's community colleges."", ""And we'll make it easier for Americans to afford a college education by increasing the size of Pell grants."", 'To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs.', 'Small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job-creators from junk lawsuits.', 'Justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos claims, and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year.', 'To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control over their health decisions.', 'I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need.', 'To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy.', 'Nearly 4 years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home, including safe, clean nuclear energy.', 'My Clear Skies legislation will cut powerplant pollution and improve the health of our citizens.', 'And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology, from hydrogen-fueled cars to clean coal to renewable sources such as ethanol.', 'Four years of debate is enough.', 'I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on foreign energy.', 'All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs, but they are just the beginning of our duty.', 'To build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time.', 'Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent Federal Tax Code.', ""I've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the Tax Code from top to bottom."", 'And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this Nation a Tax Code that is progrowth, easy to understand, and fair to all.', ""America's immigration system is also outdated, unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country."", 'We should not be content with laws that punish hard-working people who want only to provide for their families and deny businesses willing workers and invite chaos at our border.', 'It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary-guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.', ""One of America's most important institutions, a symbol of the trust between generations, is also in need of wise and effective reform."", 'Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century.', 'The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy.', 'And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security.', 'Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement.', 'And for them the system is sound and fiscally strong.', 'I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you; for you, the Social Security system will not change in any way.', 'For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time.', 'Social Security was created decades ago for a very different era.', 'In those days, people did not live as long.', 'Benefits were much lower than they are today.', 'And a half century ago, about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.', 'Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen.', ""In today's world, people are living longer and, therefore, drawing benefits longer."", 'And those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades.', ""And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about 3 workers."", 'And over the next few decades, that number will fall to just 2 workers per beneficiary.', 'With each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.', 'So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in.', 'And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before.', 'For example, in the year 2027, the Government will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion to keep the system afloat, and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than $300 billion.', 'By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt.', 'If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in Social Security benefits or other Government programs.', 'I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off.', 'But those dates are not so distant, as any parent will tell you.', ""If you have a 5-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road."", ""If you've got children in their twenties, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter."", 'And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress.', 'You and I share a responsibility.', 'We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all.', 'Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options.', 'Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees.', 'Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages.', 'During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age.', 'Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits.', 'The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated.', 'All these ideas are on the table.', 'I know that none of these reforms would be easy.', ""But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics."", 'I will work with Members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms.', 'I will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer.', 'We must, however, be guided by some basic principles.', 'We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day.', 'We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes.', 'We must ensure that lower income Americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement.', 'We must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement.', 'And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future.', 'As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers.', 'And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts.', 'Here is how the idea works.', ""Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees."", ""If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future."", ""Here's why the personal accounts are a better deal."", 'Your money will grow over time at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver, and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security.', ""In addition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and—or grandchildren."", 'And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the Government can never take it away.', 'The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts.', ""We'll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds."", ""We'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees."", ""We'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement."", ""We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once but rather paid out over time as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits."", ""And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts."", 'Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to Federal employees, because you already have something similar called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based investment funds.', ""It's time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young Americans."", 'Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society.', 'So many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children.', 'Government is not the source of these values, but Government should never undermine them.', 'Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be redefined by activist judges.', 'For the good of families, children, and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage.', 'Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life.', 'Medical research can help us reach that goal by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities, and I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health.', 'To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others.', 'We should all be able to agree on some clear standards.', 'I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity.', 'America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical.', 'Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench.', 'As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well-qualified to serve on the bench, and I have done so.', 'The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.', 'Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America.', 'Our Government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places.', 'Now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy or gangs or jail.', 'Tonight I propose a 3-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence.', 'Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders in programs ranging from literacy to sports.', 'And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush.', 'Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease.', 'And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases, African American men and women.', 'Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice.', 'In America, we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit, so we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction.', 'Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side.', 'Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger and protected by peace.We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy, and chief among them is freedom from fear.', 'In the 3 1/2 years since September the 11th, 2001, we have taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans.', ""We've created a new department of Government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more than a half million first-responders."", 'Police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all.', 'Our Nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing.', 'The Al Qaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed.', 'There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined.', 'There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction but no longer without attention and without consequence.', 'Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many and intimidate us all, and we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won.', 'Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror, and I thank the Congress for providing our service men and women with the resources they have needed.', 'During this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory.', 'Other nations around the globe have stood with us.', 'In Afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security.', 'In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a mission to help train Iraqi officers.', ""We're cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials."", ""We're working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions."", 'Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries have captured or detained Al Qaida terrorists.', 'In the next 4 years, my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time.', 'In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder.', 'If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades.', 'The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force of human freedom.', 'Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the ""evil principle"" of democracy.', ""And we've declared our own intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world."", 'The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else.', 'That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies.', 'They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life.', 'Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their own cultures.', 'And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace.', 'That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by women voting in Afghanistan and Palestinians choosing a new direction and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a President.', 'We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty, and in the coming years, we will add to that story.', 'The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian Territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure.', 'Tomorrow morning Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas.', 'She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state.', 'To promote this democracy, I will ask Congress for $350 million to support Palestinian political, economic, and security reforms.', 'The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace is within reach, and America will help them achieve that goal.', 'To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom.', 'Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain.', 'The Government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future.', 'And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East.', 'To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder.', 'Syria still allows its territory and parts of Lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region.', 'You have passed and we are applying the Syrian Accountability Act, and we expect the Syrian Government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom.', ""Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror, pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve."", 'We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror.', 'And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you.', 'Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq.', 'That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there.', 'Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq so we do not have to face them here at home.', 'And the victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.', 'We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they showed the world last Sunday.', 'Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new Transitional National Assembly.', 'A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote.', 'She said, ""Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me: The insurgents are weak; they are afraid of democracy; they are losing.', 'So I got my husband and I got my parents, and we all came out and voted together.""', 'Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it.', 'In any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility.', 'For millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all.', ""One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail."", 'She says of her country, ""We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein.', 'That was the real occupation.', 'Thank you to the American people who paid the cost but, most of all, to the soldiers.""', ""Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service."", 'Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country, and we are honored that she is with us tonight.', 'The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and will continue to attack it.', ""Yet the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed."", 'The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces; they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections.', 'And the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people.', 'We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own history.', 'As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September, ""Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible.""', 'That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq.', 'The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country.', 'At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground and in consultation with the Iraqi Government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces, forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure.', 'As those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role.', 'In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend their own country, and we will help that proud new nation secure its liberty.', 'Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, ""Tell America not to abandon us.""', 'He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging.', 'We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come.', 'We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out.', 'We are in Iraq to achieve a result, a country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able to defend itself.', 'And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned.', 'Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders.', 'We have given them training and equipment, and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud.', ""The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they're making our Nation more secure."", 'Some of our service men and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover.', 'And we have said farewell to some very good men and women who died for our freedom and whose memory this Nation will honor forever.', 'One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah.', 'His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a marine and how proud he was to be on the frontline against terror.', 'She wrote, ""When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born.', ""He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom."", 'Now it is my turn to protect you.""\'', ""Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts we honor freedom's defenders and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood."", 'In these 4 years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events.', 'We have known times of sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory.', 'In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us.', ""The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world."", 'We are all part of a great venture: To extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom brings.', 'As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, ""Each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.""', 'And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born.', 'The abolition of slavery was only a dream until it was fulfilled.', 'The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream until it was achieved.', 'The fall of imperial communism was only a dream until, one day, it was accomplished.', 'Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence.', 'The road of providence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom.', 'Thank you, and may God bless America.']","['Mr.', 'Speaker', ',', 'Vice', 'President', 'Cheney',

"Good afternoon, friends and fellow citizens. Two days ago, Americans gathered on the Washington Mall to celebrate our Nation's ideals. Today, you are gathered to remind our country that one of those ideals is the infinite value of every life. I deeply appreciate your message and your work. You see the weak and defenseless, and you try to help them. You see the hardship of many young mothers and their unborn children, and you care for them both. In so many ways, you make our society more compassionate and welcoming. We share a great goal: to work toward a day when every child is welcomed in life and protected in law. We know this will not come easily, or all at once. But the goal leads us onward: to build a culture of life, affirming that every person, at every stage and season of life, is created equal in God's image. The promises of our Declaration of Independence are not just for the strong, the independent, or the healthy. They are for everyone—including unborn children. We are a society with enough compassion and wealth and love to care for both mothers and their children, to seek the promise and potential in every human life. I believe that we are making progress toward that goal. I trust in the good hearts of Americans. I trust in the unfolding promise of our country—an expanding circle of inclusion and protection. And I trust in the civility and good sense of our citizens—a willingness to engage our differences in a spirit of tolerance and good will. All of you marching today have never tired in a good cause. Thank you for your conviction, your idealism, and your courage. May God bless you all. GEORGE W.

"I congratulate the Iraqi Governing Council and the Iraqi people on completing the Transitional Administrative Law for Iraq. This document is an important step toward the establishment of a sovereign government on June 30. It lays the foundation for democratic elections and for a new constitution, which will be written by an elected Iraqi assembly and approved by the Iraqi people. This law provides a framework for continued cooperation among Iraq, members of the international Coalition, and the United Nations as the Iraqi people make progress towards democracy. And it provides the essential freedoms and rights to all Iraqis regardless of gender, religion, or ethnic origin—including freedom of religion, freedom of speech and assembly, the right to a fair trial, and the right to choose their own representatives. The adoption of this law marks a historic milestone in the Iraqi people's long journey from tyranny and violence to liberty and peace. While difficult work remains to establish democracy in Iraq, today's signing is a critical step in that direction.",statement-the-completion-the-transitional-administrative-law-iraq.txt,73,i

"Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, and ladies and gentlemen: We meet one year and one day after a terrorist attack brought grief to my country and brought grief to many citizens of our world. Yesterday we remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible morning. Today we turn to the urgent duty of protecting other lives, without illusion and without fear. We've accomplished much in the last year in Afghanistan and beyond. We have much yet to do in Afghanistan and beyond. Many nations represented here have joined in the fight against global terror, and the people of the United States are grateful. The United Nations was born in the hope that survived a world war, the hope of a world moving toward justice, escaping old patterns of conflict and fear. The founding members resolved that the peace of the world must never again be destroyed by the will and wickedness of any man. We created a United Nations Security Council so that, unlike the League of Nations, our deliberations would be more than talk, our resolutions would be more than wishes. After generations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and squandered lives, we dedicated ourselves to standards of human dignity shared by all and to a system of security defended by all. Today, these standards and this security are challenged. Our commitment to human dignity is challenged by persistent poverty and raging disease. The suffering is great, and our responsibilities are clear. The United States is joining with the world to supply aid where it reaches people and lifts up lives, to extend trade and the prosperity it brings, and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed. As a symbol of our commitment to human dignity, the United States will return to UNESCO. This organization has been reformed, and America will participate fully in its mission to advance human rights and tolerance and learning. Our common security is challenged by regional conflicts, ethnic and religious strife that is ancient but not inevitable. In the Middle East, there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine, living side by side with Israel in peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices. My Nation will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict. Above all, our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions. In the attacks on America a year ago, we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies. This threat hides within many nations, including my own. In cells and camps, terrorists are plotting further destruction and building new bases for their war against civilization. And our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massive scale. In one place—in one regime—we find all these dangers in their most lethal and aggressive forms, exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations was born to confront. Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded Kuwait without provocation, and the regime's forces were poised to continue their march to seize other countries and their resources. Had Saddam Hussein been appeased instead of stopped, he would have endangered the peace and stability of the world. Yet this aggression was stopped by the might of coalition forces and the will of the United Nations. To suspend hostilities, to spare himself, Iraq's dictator accepted a series of commitments. The terms were clear to him and to all, and he agreed to prove he is complying with every one of those obligations. He has proven instead only his contempt for the United Nations and for all his pledges. By breaking every pledge, by his deceptions, and by his cruelties, Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself. In 1991, Security Council Resolution 688 demanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once the repression of its own people, including the systematic repression of minorities, which the Council said threatened international peace and security in the region. This demand goes ignored. Last year, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq continues to commit extremely grave violations of human rights and that the regime's repression is all-pervasive. Tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, summary execution, and torture by beating and burning, electric shock, starvation, mutilation, and rape. Wives are tortured in front of their husbands, children in the presence of their parents, and all of these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state. In 1991, the U.N. Security Council, through Resolutions 686 and 687, demanded that Iraq return all prisoners from Kuwait and other lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke this promise. Last year, the Secretary-General's high-level coordinator for this issue reported that Kuwaiti, Saudi, Indian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Bahraini, and Omani nationals remain unaccounted for—more than 600 people. One American pilot is among them. In 1991, the U.N. Security Council, through Resolution 687, demanded that Iraq renounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke this promise. In violation of Security Council Resolution 1373, Iraq continues to shelter and support terrorist organizations that direct violence against Iran, Israel, and Western governments. Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for murder. In 1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the Amir of Kuwait and a former American President. Iraq's Government openly praised the attacks of September the 11th, and Al Qaida terrorists escaped from Afghanistan and are known to be in Iraq. In 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and to prove to the world it has done so by complying with rigorous inspections. Iraq has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge. From 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it had no biological weapons. After a senior official in its weapons program defected and exposed this lie, the regime admitted to producing tens of thousands of liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with Scud warheads, aerial bombs, and aircraft spray tanks. U.N. inspectors believe Iraq has produced 2 to 4 times the amount of biological agents it declared and has failed to account for more than 3 metric tons of material that could be used to produce biological weapons. Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons. United Nations inspections also revealed that Iraq likely maintains stockpiles of VX, mustard, and other chemical agents and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capable of producing chemical weapons. And in 1995, after 4 years of deception, Iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclear weapons program prior to the Gulf war. We know now, were it not for that war, the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993. Today, Iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program, weapons design, procurement logs, experiment data, an accounting of nuclear materials, and documentation of foreign assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians. It retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year. And Iraq's state-controlled media has reported numerous meetings between Saddam Hussein and his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons. Iraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometers permitted by the U.N. Work at testing and production facilities shows that Iraq is building more long-range missiles, that it can inflict mass death throughout the region. In 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the world imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Those sanctions were maintained after the war to compel the regime's compliance with Security Council resolutions. In time, Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy food. Saddam Hussein has subverted this program, working around the sanctions to buy missile technology and military materials. He blames the suffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations, even as he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for himself and to buy arms for his country. By refusing to comply with his own agreements, he bears full guilt for the hunger and misery of innocent Iraqi citizens. In 1991, Iraq promised U.N. inspectors immediate and unrestricted access to verify Iraq's commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles. Iraq broke this promise, spending 7 years deceiving, evading, and harassing U.N. inspectors before ceasing cooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991 ceasefire, the Security Council twice renewed its demand that the Iraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors, condemning Iraq's serious violations of its obligations. The Security Council again renewed that demand in 1994 and twice more in 1996, deploring Iraq's clear violations of its obligations. The Security Council renewed its demand three more times in 1997, citing flagrant violations, and three more times in 1998, calling Iraq's behavior totally unacceptable. And in 1999, the demand was renewed yet again. As we meet today, it's been almost 4 years since the last U.N. inspectors set foot in Iraq, 4 years for the Iraqi regime to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy. We know that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when inspectors were in his country. Are we to assume that he stopped when they left? The history, the logic, and the facts lead to one conclusion: Saddam Hussein's regime is a grave and gathering danger. To suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To assume this regime's good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble. And this is a risk we must not take. Delegates to the General Assembly, we have been more than patient. We've tried sanctions. We've tried the carrot of oil for food and the stick of coalition military strikes. But Saddam Hussein has defied all these efforts and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we may be completely certain he has a— nuclear weapons is when, God forbids, he uses one. We owe it to all our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day from coming. The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the United Nations and a threat to peace. Iraq has answered a decade of U.N. demands with a decade of defiance. All the world now faces a test and the United Nations a difficult and defining moment. Are Security Council resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast aside without consequence? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding, or will it be irrelevant? The United States helped found the United Nations. We want the United Nations to be effective and respectful and successful. We want the resolutions of the world's most important multilateral body to be enforced. And right now those resolutions are being unilaterally subverted by the Iraqi regime. Our partnership of nations can meet the test before us by making clear what we now expect of the Iraqi regime. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately and unconditionally forswear, disclose, and remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction, long-range missiles, and all related material. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all support for terrorism and act to suppress it, as all states are required to do by U.N. Security Council resolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will cease persecution of its civilian population, including Shi'a, Sunnis, Kurds, Turkomans, and others, again as required by Security Council resolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will release or account for all Gulf war personnel whose fate is still unknown. It will return the remains of any who are deceased, return stolen property, accept liability for losses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait, and fully cooperate with international efforts to resolve these issues, as required by Security Council resolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-food program. It will accept U.N. administration of funds from that program, to ensure that the money is used fairly and promptly for the benefit of the Iraqi people. If all these steps are taken, it will signal a new openness and accountability in Iraq. And it could open the prospect of the United Nations helping to build a government that represents all Iraqis, a government based on respect for human rights, economic liberty, and internationally supervised elections. The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. They've suffered too long in silent captivity. Liberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a great strategic goal. The people of Iraq deserve it; the security of all nations requires it. Free societies do not intimidate through cruelty and conquest, and open societies do not threaten the world with mass murder. The United States supports political and economic liberty in a unified Iraq. We can harbor no illusions, and that's important today to remember. Saddam Hussein attacked Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He's fired ballistic missiles at Iran and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Israel. His regime once ordered the killing of every person between the ages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish villages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iranians and 40 Iraqi villages. My Nation will work with the U.N. Security Council to meet our common challenge. If Iraq's regime defies us again, the world must move deliberately, decisively to hold Iraq to account. We will work with the U.N. Security Council for the necessary resolutions. But the purposes of the United States should not be doubted. The Security Council resolutions will be enforced, the just demands of peace and security will be met, or action will be unavoidable. And a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power. Events can turn in one of two ways. If we fail to act in the face of danger, the people of Iraq will continue to live in brutal submission. The regime will have new power to bully and dominate and conquer its neighbors, condemning the Middle East to more years of bloodshed and fear. The regime will remain unstable—the region will remain unstable, with little hope of freedom, and isolated from the progress of our times. With every step the Iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons, our own options to confront that regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies, then the attacks of September the 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors. If we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome this danger, we can arrive at a very different future. The people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. They can one day join a democratic Afghanistan and a democratic Palestine, inspiring reforms throughout the Muslim world. These nations can show by their example that honest government and respect for women and the great Islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the Middle East and beyond. And we will show that the promise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our time. Neither of these outcomes is certain. Both have been set before us. We must choose between a world of fear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by and do nothing while dangers gather. We must stand up for our security and for the permanent rights and the hopes of mankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States of America will make that stand. And delegates to the United Nations, you have the power to make that stand as well. Thank you very much.",address-the-united-nations-general-assembly-new-york-city-1.txt,15,mr secretary general mr president distinguished delegates and ladies and gentlemen we meet one year and one day

other deadly biological agents for use with scud warheads aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks u n inspectors believe iraq has produced 2 to 4 times the amount of biological agents it declared and has failed to account for more than 3 metric tons of material that could be used to produce biological weapons right now iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons united nations inspections also revealed that iraq likely maintains stockpiles of vx mustard and other chemical agents and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capable of producing chemical weapons and in 1995 after 4 years of deception iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclear weapons program prior to the gulf war we know now were it not for that war the regime in iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993 today iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program weapons design procurement logs experiment data an accounting of nuclear materials and documentation of foreign assistance iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians it retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon iraq has made several attempts to buy high strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon should iraq acquire fissile material it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year and iraq's state controlled media has reported numerous meetings between saddam hussein and his nuclear scientists leaving little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons iraq also possesses a force of scud type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometers permitted by the u n work at testing and production facilities shows that iraq is building more long range missiles that it can inflict mass death throughout the region in 1990 after iraq's invasion of kuwait the world imposed economic sanctions on iraq those sanctions were maintained after the war to compel the regime's compliance with security council resolutions in time iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy food saddam hussein has subverted this program working around the sanctions to buy missile technology and military materials he blames the suffering of iraq's people on the united nations even as he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for himself and to buy arms for his country by refusing to comply with his own agreements he bears full guilt for the hunger and misery of innocent iraqi citizens in 1991 iraq promised u n inspectors immediate and unrestricted access to verify iraq's commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles iraq broke this promise spending 7 years deceiving evading and harassing u n inspectors before ceasing cooperation entirely just months after the 1991 ceasefire the security council twice renewed its demand that the iraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors condemning iraq's serious violations of its obligations the security council again renewed that demand in 1994 and twice more in 1996 deploring iraq's clear violations of its obligations the security council renewed its demand three more times in 1997 citing flagrant violations and three more times in 1998 calling iraq's behavior totally unacceptable and in 1999 the demand was renewed yet again as we meet today it's been almost 4 years since the last u n inspectors set foot in iraq 4 years for the iraqi regime to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy we know that saddam hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when inspectors were in his country are we to assume that he stopped when they left the history the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion saddam hussein's regime is a grave and gathering danger to suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence to assume this regime's good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble and this is a risk we must not take delegates to the general assembly we have been more than patient we've tried sanctions we've tried the carrot of oil for food and the stick of coalition military strikes but saddam hussein has defied all these efforts and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction the first time we may be completely certain he has a'nuclear weapons is when god forbids he uses one we owe it to all our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day from coming the conduct of the iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the united nations and a threat to peace iraq has answered a decade of u n demands with a decade of defiance all the world now faces a test and the united nations a difficult and defining moment are security council resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast aside without consequence will the united nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant the united states helped found the united nations we want the united nations to be effective and respectful and successful we want the resolutions of the world's most important multilateral body to be enforced and right now those resolutions are being unilaterally subverted by the iraqi regime our partnership of nations can meet the test before us by making clear what we now expect of the iraqi regime if the iraqi regime wishes peace it will immediately and unconditionally forswear disclose and remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction long range missiles and all related material if the iraqi regime wishes peace it will immediately end all support for terrorism and act to suppress it as all states are required to do by u n security council resolutions if the iraqi regime wishes peace it will cease persecution of its civilian population including shi'a sunnis kurds turkomans and others again as required by security council resolutions if the iraqi regime wishes peace it will release or account for all gulf war personnel whose fate is still unknown it will return the remains of any who are deceased return stolen property accept liability for losses resulting from the invasion of kuwait and fully cooperate with international efforts to resolve these issues as required by security council resolutions if the iraqi regime wishes peace it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil for food program it will accept u n administration of funds from that program to ensure that the money is used fairly and promptly for the benefit of the iraqi people if all these steps are taken it will signal a new openness and accountability in iraq and it could open the prospect of the united nations helping to build a government that represents all iraqis a government based on respect for human rights economic liberty and internationally supervised elections the united states has no quarrel with the iraqi people they've suffered too long in silent captivity liberty for the iraqi people is a great moral cause and a great strategic goal the people of iraq deserve it the security of all nations requires it free societies do not intimidate through cruelty and conquest and open societies do not threaten the world with mass murder the united states supports political and economic liberty in a unified iraq we can harbor no illusions and that's important today to remember saddam hussein attacked iran in 1980 and kuwait in 1990 he's fired ballistic missiles at iran and saudi arabia bahrain and israel his regime once ordered the killing of every person between the ages of 15 and 70 in certain kurdish villages in northern iraq he has gassed many iranians and 40 iraqi villages my nation will work with the u n security council to meet our common challenge if iraq's regime defies us again the world must move deliberately decisively to hold iraq to account we will work with the u n security council for the necessary resolutions but the purposes of the united states should not be doubted the security council resolutions will be enforced the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will be unavoidable and a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power events can turn in one of two ways if we fail to act in the face of danger the people of iraq will continue to live in brutal submission the regime will have new power to bully and dominate and conquer its neighbors condemning the middle east to more years of bloodshed and fear the regime will remain unstable'the region will remain unstable with little hope of freedom and isolated from the progress of our times with every step the iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons our own options to confront that regime will narrow and if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies then the attacks of september the 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors if we meet our responsibilities if we overcome this danger we can arrive at a very different future the people of iraq can shake off their captivity they can one day join a democratic afghanistan and a democratic palestine inspiring reforms throughout the muslim world these nations can show by their example that honest government and respect for women and the great islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the middle east and beyond and we will show that the promise of the united nations can be fulfilled in our time neither of these outcomes is certain both have been set before us we must choose between a world of fear and a world of progress we cannot stand by and do nothing while dangers gather we must stand up for our security and for the permanent rights and the hopes of mankind by heritage and by choice the united states of america will make that stand and delegates to the united nations you have the power to make that stand as well thank you very much ,<nrclex.NRCLex object at

"Thank you all. Thank you. Please be seated. I'm pleased that you all are here to witness the signature of the Secure Fence Act of 2006. This bill will help protect the American people. This bill will make our borders more secure. It is an important step toward immigration reform. I want to thank the Members of Congress for their work on this important piece of legislation. I welcome you here to the White House. I'm looking forward to signing this bill. I appreciate the Vice President joining us today. I thank the Deputy Secretary, Michael Jackson, of the Department of Homeland Security. Rob Portman—he happens to be the Director of the OMB. I want to thank Ralph Basham, who is the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; David Aguilar is the Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol. I appreciate the fact that Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist has joined us, as well as House Majority Leader John Boehner. I appreciate them coming in from their respective States as I sign this piece of legislation. I want to thank Congressman Peter King, who's the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the House of Representatives. I appreciate you being here, Peter. Ours is a nation of immigrants. We're also a nation of law. Unfortunately, the United States has not been in complete control of its borders for decades, and therefore, illegal immigration has been on the rise. We have a responsibility to address these challenges. We have a responsibility to enforce our laws. We have a responsibility to secure our borders. We take this responsibility seriously. Earlier this year, I addressed the Nation from the Oval Office. I laid out our strategy for immigration reform. Part of that strategy begins with securing the border. Since I took office, we have more than doubled funding for border security—from $4.6 billion in 2001 to $10.4 billion this year. We've increased the number of Border Patrol agents from about 9,000 to more than 12,000, and by the end of 2008, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents during my Presidency. We've deployed thousands of National Guard members to assist the Border Patrol. We've upgraded technology at our borders. We've added infrastructure, including new fencing and vehicle barriers. We're adding thousands of new beds in our detention facilities so we can continue working to end catch-and-release at our southern border. During the course of my administration, we have apprehended and sent home more than 6 million people entering our country illegally. And I thank the Border Patrol for their hard work. The Secure Fence Act builds on this progress. The bill authorizes the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along our southern border. The bill authorizes more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting to help prevent people from entering our country illegally. The bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology like cameras and satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce our infrastructure at the border. We're modernizing the southern border of the United States so we can assure the American people we're doing our job of securing the border. By making wise use of physical barriers and deploying 21st century technology, we're helping our Border Patrol agents do their job. The Secure Fence Act is part of our efforts to reform our immigration system. We have more to do. Meaningful immigration reform means that we must enforce our immigration laws in the United States. It is against the law to hire someone who is here illegally. We fully understand that most businesses want to obey that law, but they cannot verify the legal status of their employees because of widespread document fraud. So we're creating a better system for verifying documents and work eligibility and, in the meantime, holding people to account for breaking the law. We must reduce pressure on our border by creating a temporary-worker plan. Willing workers ought to be matched with willing employers to do jobs Americans are not doing for a temporary—on a temporary basis. We must face the reality that millions of illegal immigrants are already here. They should not be given an automatic path to citizenship; that is amnesty. I oppose amnesty. There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic pass to citizenship for every illegal immigrant and a program of mass deportation. And I look forward to working with Congress to find that middle ground. The bill I'm about to sign is an important step in our Nation's efforts to secure our border and reform our immigration system. I want to thank the Members of Congress for joining me as I sign the Secure Fence Act of 2006.",remarks-signing-the-secure-fence-act-2006.txt,51,thank you all thank you please be seated i'm pleased

has not been in complete control of its borders for decades and therefore illegal immigration has been on the rise we have a responsibility to address these challenges we have a responsibility to enforce our laws we have a responsibility to secure our borders we take this responsibility seriously earlier this year i addressed the nation from the oval office i laid out our strategy for immigration reform part of that strategy begins with securing the border since i took office we have more than doubled funding for border security'from 4 6 billion in 2001 to 10 4 billion this year we've increased the number of border patrol agents from about 9 000 to more than 12 000 and by the end of 2008 we will have doubled the number of border patrol agents during my presidency we've deployed thousands of national guard members to assist the border patrol we've upgraded technology at our borders we've added infrastructure including new fencing and vehicle barriers we're adding thousands of new beds in our detention facilities so we can continue working to end catch and release at our southern border during the course of my administration we have apprehended and sent home more than 6 million people entering our country illegally and i thank the border patrol for their hard work the secure fence act builds on this progress the bill authorizes the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along our southern border the bill authorizes more vehicle barriers checkpoints and lighting to help prevent people from entering our country illegally the bill authorizes the department of homeland security to increase the use of advanced technology like cameras and satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce our infrastructure at the border we're modernizing the southern border of the united states so we can assure the american people we're doing our job of securing the border by making wise use of physical barriers and deploying 21st century technology we're helping our border patrol agents do their job the secure fence act is part of our efforts to reform our immigration system we have more to do meaningful immigration reform means that we must enforce our immigration laws in the united states it is against the law to hire someone who is here illegally we fully understand that most businesses want to obey that law but they cannot verify the legal status of their employees because of widespread document fraud so we're creating a better system for verifying documents and work eligibility and in the meantime holding people to account for breaking the law we must reduce pressure on our border by creating a temporary worker plan willing workers ought to be matched with willing employers to do jobs americans are not doing for a temporary'on a temporary basis we must face the reality that millions of illegal immigrants are already here they should not be given an automatic path to citizenship that is amnesty i oppose

"Thank you all. Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum. In that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. We faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say, we've answered the call.  Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose, and together we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government. All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business. That is the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. It remains our charge to keep. The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our Nation long after this session has ended. In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. Let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time. From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we've made good progress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done. In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our Nation great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions and empower them to improve their lives for their futures. To build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but the housing market has declined. At kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about our economic future. In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing. So last week, my administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment. The temptation will be to load up the bill. That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working, and this Congress must pass it as soon as possible. We have other work to do on taxes. Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we've delivered over the past 7 years will be taken away. Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their enthusiasm. I'm pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders.  Most Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other pressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry about their Federal Government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. There's only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Make the tax relief permanent. And Members of Congress should know, if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it. Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I'll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion. The budget that I will submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets; so should their Government. The people's trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks, special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I'll send it back to you with my veto. And tomorrow I will issue an Executive order that directs Federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote. Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending. On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. And Congress can help even more. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow State housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes. To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options. We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not Government control. So I have proposed ending the bias in the Tax Code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer. This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year. Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create association health plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. With all these steps, we will ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor's office, not in the Halls of Congress. On education, we must trust students to learn, if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams, and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them. Six years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today, no one can deny its results. Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. Reading scores are on the rise. African American and Hispanic students posted alltime highs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibilities for States and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools. Members of Congress, the No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding, and we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law. We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up. Thanks to the DC Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation's Capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other nonpublic school. Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's inner cities. So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. And to open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell grants help low-income college students realize their full potential. Together, we've expanded the size and reach of these grants. Now let us apply the same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools. On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world. So we're working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. We're working for a successful Doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. At the same time, we're pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements. I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea. Many products from these nations now enter America duty free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets. These agreements will level the playing field. They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world, those whose products say ""Made in the U.S.A."" These agreements also promote America's strategic interests. The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life. Trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the Federal Government has a responsibility to help. I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs. To build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology. Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil. Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded. Together, we should take the next steps. Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions. Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power. Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future. Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and China make a greater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases. This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy efficient technology. To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. So I ask Congress to double Federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth. On matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life. So we're expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research. And as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves. And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices, such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life. On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says. I've submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote. In communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. Over the past 7 years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. Americans have volunteered in record numbers. Charitable donations are higher than ever. Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the Federal Government. And to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for Federal funds, I ask you to permanently extend charitable choice. Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast. America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before. And tonight I'm pleased to announce that in April, we will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans. There are two other pressing challenges that I've raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration. Every Member in this Chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford. We all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. I've laid out proposals to reform these programs. Now I ask Members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren. The other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure our borders, and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so. We're increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. We've effectively ended the policy of catch-and-release at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm. We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals. This is the business of our Nation here at home. Yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world. Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. In the last 7 years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty. We've s
een citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections. We've seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence. We've seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new President and a new parliament. We've seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. These images of liberty have inspired us. In the past 7 years, we've also seen the images that have sobered us. We've watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's hand. We've seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs. On a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant. These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists, evil men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule. Since 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists. We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies. We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear. Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories. And that is why, for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom. In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country. Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for Al Qaida is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope. These successes must continue, so we're adding 3,200 marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban and Al Qaida is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting America's vital mission in Afghanistan. In Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. So we reviewed our strategy and changed course. We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq. We gave our troops a new mission: work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country. The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country. They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return. And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole Nation. The Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of Al Qaida's brutality, started a popular uprising called the Anbar Awakening. Over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country. And today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. The Government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well, adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year. While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just 1 year ago. When we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible. A year later, high-profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down. When we met last year, militia extremists—some armed and trained by Iran— were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters. And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country. When we met last year, Al Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is Al Qaida that is searching for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held. And over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key Al Qaida leaders and operatives. Last month, Usama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on Al Qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. Al Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated. When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of return on success, and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home. This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. This evening I want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines. Soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we've asked of you and more. Our Nation is grateful for your courage. We are proud of your accomplishments. And tonight in this hallowed Chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our Nation. And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops. Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with Iraqi forces and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission. As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced. In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home. Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in, quote, ""the disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, Al Qaida-Iraq regaining lost ground, and a marked increase in violence."" Members of Congress, having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen. In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they're making toward political reconciliation. At the local level, Sunnis, Shi'a, and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the Provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad. We're seeing some encouraging signs. The national Government is sharing oil revenues with the Provinces. The parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-Ba'athification reform. They're now debating a Provincial powers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel, but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place, and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future. The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our Nation, but it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed. A free Iraq will deny Al Qaida a safe haven. A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible. A free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world. By contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland. The enemy has made its intentions clear. At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, Al Qaida's top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington. My fellow Americans, we will not rest either. We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated. We must do the difficult work today so that years from now, people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America. We're also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have new cause for hope. Palestinians have elected a President who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel. Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security. This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year. The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side by side in peace. We're also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran. Iran's rulers oppress a good and talented people. And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it. Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hizballah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land. Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon. Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you. We respect your traditions and your history. We look forward to the day when you have your freedom. Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad. But above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops, we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf. On the homefront, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country. This is our most solemn duty. We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11. This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. In the past 6 years, we've stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in our Government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. These good citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this Chamber owes them our thanks. And we owe them something more; we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe. And one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications. To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they're planning. Last year, Congress passed legislation to help us do that. Unfortunately, Congress set the legislations to expire on February the 1st. That means if you don't act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger. Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted. Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America. We've had ample time for debate. The time to act is now. Protecting our Nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military. It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair. So America is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world. This is a reflection of our national interests; it is the calling of our conscience. America opposes genocide in Sudan. We support freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma. America is leading the fight against global poverty with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance. We've also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account. This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative. America is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than half the world's food aid comes from the United States. And tonight I ask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine. America is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we're working to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people. We can bring healing and hope to many more. So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success. And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the next 5 years. America is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over the past 7 years, we've increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. And as we increase funding, we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation. I call on Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity. Our military families also sacrifice for America. They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home. We have a responsibility to provide for them. So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the Federal Government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children. Our military families serve our Nation, they inspire our Nation, and tonight our Nation honors them. The strength—the secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness lies not in our Government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. When the Federal Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our Nation was bound by the
 Articles of Confederation, which began with the words, ""We the undersigned delegates."" When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our new Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our Nation and the history of the world: ""We the people."" By trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women. By trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile, young democracy into the most powerful nation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions. And so long as we continue to trust the people, our Nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our Union will remain strong. So tonight, with confidence in freedom's power and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business. God bless America.
",address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-18.txt,2,thank you all madam speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished guests and fellow citizens seven years have passed since i first stood before you at this rostrum in that time our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined we faced hard decisions about peace and war rising competition in the world economy and the health and welfare of our citizens these issues call for vigorous debate and i think it's fair to say we've answered the call yet history will record that amid our differences we acted with purpose and together we showed the world the power and resilience of american self government all of us were sent to washington to carry out the people's business that is the purpose of this body it is the meaning of our oath it remains our charge to keep the actions of the 110th congress will affect the security and prosperity of our nation long after this session has ended in this election year let us show our fellow americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them let us show them that republicans and democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time from expanding opportunity to protecting our country we've made good progress yet we have unfinished business before us and the american people expect us to get it done in the work ahead we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation great as americans we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history we believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens and so in all we do we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions and empower them to improve their lives for their futures to build a prosperous future we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy as we meet tonight our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty america has added jobs for a record 52 straight months but jobs are now growing at a slower pace wages are up but so are prices for food and gas exports are rising but the housing market has declined at kitchen tables across our country there is a concern about our economic future in the long run americans can be confident about our economic growth but in the short run we can all see that that growth is slowing so last week my administration reached agreement with speaker pelosi and republican leader boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment the temptation will be to load up the bill that would delay it or derail it and neither option is acceptable this is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working and this congress must pass it as soon as possible we have other work to do on taxes unless congress acts most of the tax relief we've delivered over the past 7 years will be taken away some in washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase try explaining that to 116 million american taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of 1 800 others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes i welcome their enthusiasm i'm pleased to report that the irs accepts both checks and money orders most americans think their taxes are high enough with all the other pressures on their finances american families should not have to worry about their federal government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks there's only one way to eliminate this uncertainty make the tax relief permanent and members of congress should know if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk i will veto it just as we trust americans with their own money we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely next week i'll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs totaling more than 18 billion the budget that i will submit will keep america on track for a surplus in 2012 american families have to balance their budgets so should their government the people's trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute without discussion or debate last year i asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half i also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote unfortunately neither goal was met so this time if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half i'll send it back to you with my veto and tomorrow i will issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by congress if these items are truly worth funding congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending on housing we must trust americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market my administration brought together the hope now alliance which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and congress can help even more tonight i ask you to pass legislation to reform fannie mae and freddie mac modernize the federal housing administration and allow state housing agencies to issue tax free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages these are difficult times for many american families and by taking these steps we can help more of them keep their homes to build a future of quality health care we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options we share a common goal making health care more affordable and accessible for all americans the best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice not government control so i have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer this one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions and i call on the congress to pass it this year congress must also expand health savings accounts create association health plans for small businesses promote health information technology and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits with all these steps we will ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor's office not in the halls of congress on education we must trust students to learn if given the chance and empower parents to demand results from our schools in neighborhoods across our country there are boys and girls with dreams and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them six years ago we came together to pass the no child left behind act and today no one can deny its results last year fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record reading scores are on the rise african american and hispanic students posted alltime highs now we must work together to increase accountability add flexibilities for states and districts reduce the number of high school dropouts provide extra help for struggling schools members of congress the no child left behind act is a bipartisan achievement it is succeeding and we owe it to america's children their parents and their teachers to strengthen this good law we must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up thanks to the dc opportunity scholarships you approved more than 2 600 of the poorest children in our nation's capital have found new hope at a faith based or other nonpublic school sadly these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of america's inner cities so i will convene a white house summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning and to open the doors of these schools to more children i ask you to support a new 300 million program called pell grants for kids we have seen how pell grants help low income college students realize their full potential together we've expanded the size and reach of these grants now let us apply the same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools on trade we must trust american workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas today our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell american goods and crops and services all over the world so we're working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can we're working for a successful doha round of trade talks and we must complete a good agreement this year at the same time we're pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements i thank the congress for approving a good agreement with peru and now i ask you to approve agreements with colombia and panama and south korea many products from these nations now enter america duty free yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets these agreements will level the playing field they will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers they will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world those whose products say made in the u s a these agreements also promote america's strategic interests the first agreement that will come before you is with colombia a friend of america that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers if we fail to pass this agreement we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere so we must come together pass this agreement and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices yet for some americans trade can mean losing a job and the federal government has a responsibility to help i ask congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs to build a future of energy security we must trust in the creative genius of american researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology our security our prosperity and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil last year i asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade and you responded together we should take the next steps let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions free nuclear power let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future let us create a new international clean technology fund which will help developing nations like india and china make a greater use of clean energy sources and let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow stop and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride the united states is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change and the best way to meet these goals is for america to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy efficient technology to keep america competitive into the future we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow last year congress passed legislation supporting the american competitiveness initiative but never followed through with the funding this funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge so i ask congress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure america remains the most dynamic nation on earth on matters of life and science we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries in november we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells this breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life so we're expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research and as we explore promising avenues of research we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves and so i call on congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such as the buying selling patenting or cloning of human life on matters of justice we must trust in the wisdom of our founders and empower judges who understand that the constitution means what it says i've submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law not the whim of the gavel many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed they are worthy of confirmation and the senate should give each of them a prompt up or down vote in communities across our land we must trust in the good heart of the american people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need over the past 7 years more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service americans have volunteered in record numbers charitable donations are higher than ever faith based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair with newfound support from the federal government and to help guarantee equal treatment of faith based organizations when they compete for federal funds i ask you to permanently extend charitable choice tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the gulf coast america honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region we reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before and tonight i'm pleased to announce that in april we will host this year's north american summit of canada mexico and the united states in the great city of new orleans there are two other pressing challenges that i've raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address entitlement spending and immigration every member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like social security medicare and medicaid is growing faster than we can afford we all know the painful choices ahead if america stays on this path massive tax increases sudden and drastic cuts in benefits or crippling deficits i've laid out proposals to reform these programs now i ask members of congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren the other pressing challenge is immigration america needs to secure our borders and with your help my administration is taking steps to do so we're increasing worksite enforcement deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings we've effectively ended the policy of catch and release at the border and by the end of this year we will have doubled the number of border patrol agents yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy this will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm we must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally illegal immigration is complicated but it can be resolved and it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals this is the business of our nation here at home yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world our foreign policy is based on a clear premise we trust that people when given the chance will choose a future of freedom and peace in the last 7 years we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty we've seen citizens in georgia and ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections we've seen people in lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence we've seen afghans emerge from the tyranny of the taliban and choose a new president and a new parliament we've seen jubilant iraqis holding up ink stained fingers and celebrating their freedom these images of liberty have inspired us in the past 7 years we've also seen the images that have sobered us we've watched throngs of mourners in lebanon and pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's hand we've seen wedding guests in blood soaked finery staggering from a hotel in jordan afghans and iraqis blown up in mosques and markets and trains in london and madrid ripped apart by bombs on a clear september day we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant these horrific images serve as a grim reminder the advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists evil men who despise freedom despise america and aim to subject millions to their violent rule since 9 11 we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists we will stay on the offense we will keep up the pressure and we will deliver justice to our enemies we are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century the terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear yet in this war on terror there is one thing we and our enemies agree on in the long run men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny and that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in lebanon iraq afghanistan pakistan and the palestinian territories and that is why for the security of america and the peace of the world we are spreading the hope of freedom in afghanistan america our 25 nato allies and 15 partner nations are helping the afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel a nation that was once a safe haven for al qaida is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school new roads and hospitals are being built and people are looking to the future with new hope these successes must continue so we're adding 3 200 marines to our forces in afghanistan where they will fight the terrorists and train the afghan army and police defeating the taliban and al qaida is critical to our security and i thank the congress for supporting america's vital mission in afghanistan in iraq the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world one year ago our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge iraq into chaos so we reviewed our strategy and changed course we launched a surge of american forces into iraq we gave our troops a new mission work with the iraqi forces to protect the iraqi people pursue the enemy in its strongholds and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country the iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened those who had worried that america was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of american forces flowing into their country they saw our forces moving into neighborhoods clearing out the terrorists and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return and they saw our troops along with provincial reconstruction teams that include foreign service officers and other skilled public servants coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life our military and civilians in iraq are performing with courage and distinction and they have the gratitude of our whole nation the iraqis launched a surge of their own in the fall of 2006 sunni tribal leaders grew tired of al qaida's brutality started a popular uprising called the anbar awakening over the past year similar movements have spread across the country and today the grassroots surge includes more than 80 000 iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists the government in baghdad has stepped forward as well adding more than 100 000 new iraqi soldiers and police during the past year while the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains the american and iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just 1 year ago when we met last year many said that containing the violence was impossible a year later high profile terrorist attacks are down civilian deaths are down sectarian killings are down when we met last year militia extremists'some armed and trained by iran'were wreaking havoc in large areas of iraq a year later coalition and iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters and iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country when we met last year al qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of iraq and their leaders had just offered american forces safe passage out of the country today it is al qaida that is searching for safe passage they have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held and over the past year we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in iraq including hundreds of key al qaida leaders and operatives last month usama bin laden released a tape in which he railed against iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in iraq ladies and gentlemen some may deny the surge is working but among the terrorists there is no doubt al qaida is on the run in iraq and this enemy will be defeated when we met last year our troop levels in iraq were on the rise today because of the progress just described we are implementing a policy of return on success and the surge forces we sent to iraq are beginning to come home this progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders this evening i want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines soldiers and sailors airmen marines and coastguardsmen in the past year you have done everything we've asked of you and more our nation is grateful for your courage we are proud of your accomplishments and tonight in this hallowed chamber with the american people as our witness we make you a solemn pledge in the fight ahead you will have all you need to protect our nation and i ask congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops our enemies in iraq have been hit hard they are not yet defeated and we can still expect tough fighting ahead our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy american troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with iraqi forces and eventually to a protective overwatch mission as part of this transition one army brigade combat team and one marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced in the coming months four additional brigades and two marine battalions will follow suit taken together this means more than 20 000 of our troops are coming home any further drawdown of u s troops will be based on conditions in iraq and the recommendations of our commanders general petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in quote the disintegration of the iraqi security forces al qaida iraq regaining lost ground and a marked increase in violence members of congress having come so far and achieved so much we must not allow this to happen in the coming year we will work with iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they're making toward political reconciliation at the local level sunnis shi'a and kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives progress in the provinces must be matched by progress in baghdad we're seeing some encouraging signs the national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces the parliament recently passed both a pension law and de ba'athification reform they're now debating a provincial powers law the iraqis still have a distance to travel but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence reconciliation is taking place and the iraqi people are taking control of their future the mission in iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation but it is in the vital interest of the united states that we succeed a free iraq will deny al qaida a safe haven a free iraq will show millions across the middle east that a future of liberty is possible a free iraq will be a friend of america a partner in fighting terror and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world by contrast a failed iraq would embolden the extremists strengthen iran and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends our allies and our homeland the enemy has made its intentions clear at a time when the momentum seemed to favor them al qaida's top commander in iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in washington my fellow americans we will not rest either we will not rest until this enemy has been defeated we must do the difficult work today so that years from now people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment prevailed in a tough fight and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer america we're also standing against the forces of extremism in the holy land where we have new cause for hope palestinians have elected a president who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with israel israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful democratic palestinian state will be a source of lasting security this month in ramallah and jerusalem i assured leaders from both sides that america will do and i will do everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a palestinian state by the end of this year the time has come for a holy land where a democratic israel and a democratic palestine live side by side in peace we're also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in tehran iran's rulers oppress a good and talented people and wherever freedom advances in the middle east it seems the iranian regime is there to oppose it iran is funding and training militia groups in iraq supporting hizballah terrorists in lebanon and backing hamas efforts to undermine peace in the holy land tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium which could be used to create a nuclear weapon our message to the people of iran is clear we have no quarrel with you we respect your traditions and your history we look forward to the day when you have your freedom our message to the leaders of iran is also clear verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiations can begin and to rejoin the community of nations come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions stop your oppression at home cease your support for terror abroad but above all know this america will confront those who threaten our troops we will stand by our allies and we will defend our vital interests in the persian gulf on the homefront we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country this is our most solemn duty we are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9 11 this is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy in the past 6 years we've stopped numerous attacks including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in los angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for america over the atlantic dedicated men and women in our government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans these good citizens are saving american lives and everyone in this chamber owes them our thanks and we owe them something more we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe and one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications to protect america we need to know who the terrorists are talking to what they are saying and what they're planning last year congress passed legislation to help us do that unfortunately congress set the legislations to expire on february the 1st that means if you don't act by friday our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend america we've had ample time for debate the time to act is now protecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military it also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair so america is using its influence to build a freer more hopeful and more compassionate world this is a reflection of our national interests it is the calling of our conscience america opposes genocide in sudan we support freedom in countries from cuba and zimbabwe to belarus and burma america is leading the fight against global poverty with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance we've also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the millennium challenge account this program strengthens democracy transparency and the rule of law in developing nations and i ask you to fully fund this important initiative america is leading the fight against global hunger today more than half the world's food aid comes from the united states and tonight i ask congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine america is leading the fight against disease with your help we're working to cut by half the number of malaria related deaths in 15 african nations and our emergency plan for aids relief is treating 1 4 million people we can bring healing and hope to many more so i ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success and i call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting hiv aids by approving an additional 30 billion over the next 5 years america is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people and some of the most compassionate americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us we must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace over the past 7 years we've increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent and as we increase funding we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation i call on congress to enact the reforms recommended by senator bob dole and secretary donna shalala so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity our military families also sacrifice for america they endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home we have a responsibility to provide for them so i ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal government and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children our military families serve our nation they inspire our nation and tonight our nation honors them the strength'the secret of our strength the miracle of america is that our greatness lies not in our government but in the spirit and determination of our people when the federal convention met in philadelphia in 1787 our nation was bound by the articles of confederation which began with the words we the

Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum.', 'In that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined.', 'We faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens.', ""These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say, we've answered the call."", 'Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose, and together we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government.', ""All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business."", 'That is the purpose of this body.', 'It is the meaning of our oath.', 'It remains our charge to keep.', 'The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our Nation long after this session has ended.', 'In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them.', 'Let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time.', ""From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we've made good progress."", 'Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done.', 'In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our Nation great.', 'As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history.', 'We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens.', 'And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions and empower them to improve their lives for their futures.', 'To build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy.', 'As we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty.', 'America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace.', 'Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas.', 'Exports are rising, but the housing market has declined.', 'At kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about our economic future.', 'In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth.', 'But in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing.', 'So last week, my administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment.', 'The temptation will be to load up the bill.', 'That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable.', 'This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working, and this Congress must pass it as soon as possible.', 'We have other work to do on taxes.', ""Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we've delivered over the past 7 years will be taken away."", 'Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase.', 'Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800.', 'Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes.', 'I welcome their enthusiasm.', ""I'm pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders."", 'Most Americans think their taxes are high enough.', 'With all the other pressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry about their Federal Government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks.', ""There's only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Make the tax relief permanent."", 'And Members of Congress should know, if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it.', 'Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely.', ""Next week, I'll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion."", 'The budget that I will submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012.', 'American families have to balance their budgets; so should their Government.', ""The people's trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks, special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate."", 'Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half.', 'I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote.', 'Unfortunately, neither goal was met.', ""So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I'll send it back to you with my veto."", 'And tomorrow I will issue an Executive order that directs Federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress.', 'If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote.', 'Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending.', 'On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market.', 'My administration brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.', 'And Congress can help even more.', 'Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow State housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages.', 'These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes.', 'To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options.', 'We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.', 'The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not Government control.', 'So I have proposed ending the bias in the Tax Code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer.', 'This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year.', 'Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create association health plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits.', ""With all these steps, we will ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor's office, not in the Halls of Congress."", 'On education, we must trust students to learn, if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools.', 'In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams, and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them.', 'Six years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today, no one can deny its results.', 'Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record.', 'Reading scores are on the rise.', 'African American and Hispanic students posted alltime highs.', 'Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibilities for States and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools.', 'Members of Congress, the No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement.', ""It is succeeding, and we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law."", 'We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up.', ""Thanks to the DC Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation's Capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other nonpublic school."", ""Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's inner cities."", 'So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning.', 'And to open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids.', 'We have seen how Pell grants help low-income college students realize their full potential.', ""Together, we've expanded the size and reach of these grants."", 'Now let us apply the same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools.', 'On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas.', 'Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world.', ""So we're working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can."", ""We're working for a successful Doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year."", ""At the same time, we're pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements."", 'I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru.', 'And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea.', 'Many products from these nations now enter America duty free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets.', 'These agreements will level the playing field.', 'They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers.', 'They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world, those whose products say ""Made in the U.S.A."" These agreements also promote America\'s strategic interests.', 'The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers.', 'If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere.', 'So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life.', 'Trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices.', 'Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the Federal Government has a responsibility to help.', 'I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs.', 'To build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology.', 'Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil.', 'Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded.', 'Together, we should take the next steps.', 'Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions.', 'Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power.', 'Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future.', 'Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and China make a greater use of clean energy sources.', 'And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases.', 'This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.', 'The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change.', 'And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy efficient technology.', 'To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow.', 'Last year, Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding.', 'This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge.', 'So I ask Congress to double Federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth.', 'On matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries.', 'In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells.', 'This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life.', ""So we're expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research."", 'And as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves.', 'And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices, such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life.', 'On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says.', ""I've submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel."", 'Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed.', 'They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote.', 'In communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need.', 'Over the past 7 years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service.', 'Americans have volunteered in record numbers.', 'Charitable donations are higher than ever.', 'Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the Federal Government.', 'And to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for Federal funds, I ask you to permanently extend charitable choice.', 'Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast.', 'America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region.', 'We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before.', ""And tonight I'm pleased to announce that in April, we will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans."", ""There are two other pressing challenges that I've raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration."", 'Every Member in this Chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford.', 'We all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits.', ""I've laid out proposals to reform these programs."", 'Now I ask Members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren.', 'The other pressing challenge is immigration.', 'America needs to secure our borders, and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so.', ""We're increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings."", ""We've effectively ended the policy of catch-and-release at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents."", 'Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy.', 'This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm.', 'We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally.', 'Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved.', 'And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals.', 'This is the business of our Nation here at home.', 'Yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.', 'Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace.', 'In the last 7 years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty.', ""We've seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections."", ""We've seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence."", ""We've seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new President and a new parliament."", ""We've seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom."", 'These images of liberty have inspired us.', ""In the past 7 years, we've also seen the images that have sobered us."", ""We've watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's hand."", ""We've seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs."", 'On a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant.', 'These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists, evil men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule.', 'Since 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists.', 'We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies.', 'We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century.', 'The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear.', 'Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny.', 'And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories.', 'And that is why, for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom.', 'In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country.', 'Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for Al Qaida is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope.', ""These successes must continue, so we're adding 3,200 marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police."", ""Defeating the Taliban and Al Qaida is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting America's vital mission in Afghanistan."", 'In Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world.', 'One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos.', 'So we reviewed our strategy and changed course.', 'We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq.', 'We gave our troops a new mission: work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country.', 'The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened.', 'Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country.', 'They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return.', 'And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life.', 'Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole Nation.', 'The Iraqis launched a surge of their own.', ""In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of Al Qaida's brutality, started a popular uprising called the Anbar Awakening."", 'Over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country.', 'And today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists.', 'The Government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well, adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year.', 'While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just 1 year ago.', 'When we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible.', 'A year later, high-profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down.', 'When we met last year, militia extremists—some armed and trained by Iran— were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq.', 'A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters.', 'And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country.', 'When we met last year, Al Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country.', 'Today, it is Al Qaida that is searching for safe passage.', 'They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held.', ""And over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key Al Qaida leaders and operatives."", 'Last month, Usama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on Al Qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt.', 'Al Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated.', 'When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise.', 'Today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of return on success, and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home.', 'This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders.', 'This evening I want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines.', ""Soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we've asked of you and more."", 'Our Nation is grateful for your courage.', 'We are proud of your accomplishments.', 'And tonight in this hallowed Chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our Nation.', 'And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops.', 'Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard.', 'They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead.', 'Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy.', 'American troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with Iraqi forces and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission.', 'As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced.', 'In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit.', 'Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home.', 'Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders.', 'General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in, quote, ""the disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, Al Qaida-Iraq regaining lost ground, and a marked increase in violence.""', 'Members of Congress, having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen.', ""In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they're making toward political reconciliation."", ""At the local level, Sunnis, Shi'a, and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives."", 'Progress in the Provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad.', ""We're seeing some encouraging signs."", 'The national Government is sharing oil revenues with the Provinces.', ""The parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-Ba'athification reform."", ""They're now debating a Provincial powers law."", 'The Iraqis still have a distance to travel, but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place, and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future.', 'The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our Nation, but it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed.', 'A free Iraq will deny Al Qaida a safe haven.', 'A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible.', 'A free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world.', 'By contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland.', 'The enemy has made its intentions clear.', ""At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, Al Qaida's top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington."", 'My fellow Americans, we will not rest either.', 'We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated.', 'We must do the difficult work today so that years from now, people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America.', ""We're also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have new cause for hope."", 'Palestinians have elected a President who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel.', 'Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security.', 'This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year.', 'The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side by side in peace.', ""We're also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran."", ""Iran's rulers oppress a good and talented people."", 'And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it.', 'Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hizballah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land.', 'Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon.', 'Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you.', 'We respect your traditions and your history.', 'We look forward to the day when you have your freedom.', 'Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiations can begin.', 'And to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad.', 'But above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops, we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf.', 'On the homefront, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country.', 'This is our most solemn duty.', 'We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11.', 'This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy.', ""In the past 6 years, we've stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic."", 'Dedicated men and women in our Government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans.', 'These good citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this Chamber owes them our thanks.', 'And we owe them something more; we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe.', 'And one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications.', ""To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they're planning."", 'Last year, Congress passed legislation to help us do that.', 'Unfortunately, Congress set the legislations to expire on February the 1st.', ""That means if you don't act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger."", 'Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted.', 'Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America.', ""We've had ample time for debate."", 'The time to act is now.', 'Protecting our Nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military.', 'It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair.', 'So America is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world.', 'This is a reflection of our national interests; it is the calling of our conscience.', 'America opposes genocide in Sudan.', 'We support freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma.', 'America is leading the fight against global poverty with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance.', ""We've also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account."", 'This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative.', 'America is leading the fight against global hunger.', ""Today, more than half the world's food aid comes from the United States."", 'And tonight I ask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine.', 'America is leading the fight against disease.', ""With your help, we're working to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations."", 'And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people.', 'We can bring healing and hope to many more.', 'So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success.', 'And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the next 5 years.', 'America is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us.', 'We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace.', ""Over the past 7 years, we've increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent."", 'And as we increase funding, we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation.', 'I call on Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity.', 'Our military families also sacrifice for America.', 'They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home.', 'We have a responsibility to provide for them.', 'So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the Federal Government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children.', 'Our military families serve our Nation, they inspire our Nation, and tonight our Nation honors them.', 'The strength—the secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness lies not in our Government, but in the spirit and determination of our people.', 'When the Federal Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our Nation was bound by the Articles of Confederation, which began with the words, ""We the undersigned delegates.""', 'When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our new Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our Nation and the history of the world: ""We the people.""', 'By trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women.', 'By trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile, young democracy into the most powerful nation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions.', 'And so long as we continue to trust the people, our Nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our Union will remain strong.', ""So tonight, with confidence in freedom's power and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business."", 'God bless

"Bienvenidos. Welcome to the White House for the 100th anniversary of Cuban independence. Today we honor the ties of friendship and family and faith that unite the Cuban people and the people of the United States. We honor the contributions that Cuban Americans have made to all aspects of our national life. And today I am issuing a proposal and a challenge that can put Cuba on the path to liberty. I appreciate our Secretary of State being here. He and I take this issue very seriously. He loves freedom as much as I love freedom. I want to thank Mel Martinez, a graduate of Pedro Pan, for being here. Mr. Secretary, you're doing a great job. Welcome. I appreciate members of the diplomatic corps who are here. Thank you all for coming; I'm honored to have you here. I want to thank Senator George Allen from the Commonwealth of Virginia. I want to thank Congressman Dan Burton; Mr. Chairman. And of course, two great Members of the United States Congress, people who have got a lot to offer, a lot of sound advice: Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart. Thank you all for coming. Cuba's independence one century ago today was the inspiration of great thinkers such as Felix Varela. It was the result of determination and talent on the part of a great statesman such as Jose Marti and great soldiers such as Antonio Maceo and Maximo Gomez. Most of all, Cuba's independence was the product of the great courage and sacrifice of the Cuban people. Today, and every day for the past 43 years, that legacy of courage has been insulted by a tyrant who uses brutal methods to enforce a bankrupt vision. That legacy has been debased by a relic from another era who has turned a beautiful island into a prison. In a career of oppression, Mr. Castro has imported nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, and he has exported his military forces to encourage civil war abroad. He is a dictator who jails and tortures and exiles his political opponents. We know this. The Cuban people know this, and the world knows this. After all, just a month ago the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in a resolution proposed by the nations of Latin America, called upon Cuba's Government to finally—to finally— begin respecting the human rights of its people. Through all their pains and deprivation, the Cuban people's aspirations for freedom are undiminished. We see this today in Havana, where more than 11,000 brave citizens have petitioned their Government for a referendum on basic freedoms. If that referendum is allowed, it can be a prelude, a beginning for real change in Cuba. The United States has no designs on Cuban sovereignty. It's not a part of our strategy or a part of our vision. In fact, the United States has been a strong and consistent supporter of freedom for the Cuban people. And it is important for those who love freedom on that beautiful island to know that our support for them will never waver. Today I'm announcing an Initiative for a New Cuba that offers Cuba's Government a way forward towards democracy and hope and better relations with the United States. Cuba's scheduled to hold elections to its National Assembly in 2003. Let me read Article 71 of the Cuban Constitution. It says, ""The National Assembly is composed of deputies elected by free, direct, and secret vote."" That's what the constitution says. Yet since 1959, no election in Cuba has come close to meeting these standards. In most elections, there has been one candidate, Castro's candidate. All elections in Castro's Cuba have been a fraud. The voices of the Cuban people have been suppressed, and their votes have been meaningless. That's the truth. Es la verdad. In the 2003 National Assembly elections in Cuba, Cuba has the opportunity to offer Cuban voters the substance of democracy, not its hollow, empty forms. Opposition parties should have the freedom to organize, assemble, and speak, with equal access to all airwaves. All political prisoners must be released and allowed to participate in the election process. Human rights organizations should be free to visit Cuba to ensure that the conditions for free elections are being created. And the 2003 elections should be monitored by objective outside observers. These are the minimum steps necessary to make sure that next year's elections are the true expression of the will of the Cuban people. I also challenge Cuba's Government to ease its stranglehold, to change its stranglehold on private economic activity. Political and economic freedoms go hand in hand, and if Cuba opens its political system, fundamental questions about its backward economic system will come into sharper focus. If the Cuban Government truly wants to advance the cause of workers, of Cuban workers, surely it will permit trade unions to exist outside of Government control. If Cuba wants to create more good-paying jobs, private employers have to be able to negotiate with and pay workers of their own choosing, without the Government telling who they can hire and who they must fire. If Cuba wants to attract badly needed investment from abroad, property rights must be respected. If the Government wants to improve the daily lives of its people, goods and services produced in Cuba should be made available to all Cuban citizens. Workers employed by foreign companies should be paid directly by their employers, instead of having the Government seize their hard-currency wages and pass on a pittance in the form of pesos. And the signs at hotels reading ""Solamente Turistas"" should finally be taken down. Without major steps by Cuba to open up its political system and its economic system, trade with Cuba will not help the Cuban people. It's important for Americans to understand: Without political reform, without economic reform, trade with Cuba will merely enrich Fidel Castro and his cronies. Well-intentioned ideas about trade will merely prop up this dictator, enrich his cronies, and enhance the totalitarian regime. It will not help the Cuban people. With real political and economic reform, trade can benefit the Cuban people and allow them to share in the progress of our times. If Cuba's Government takes all the necessary steps to ensure that the 2003 elections are certifiably free and fair—certifiably free and fair—and if Cuba also begins to adopt meaningful market-based reforms, then and only then I will work with the United States Congress to ease the ban on trade and travel between our two countries. Meaningful reform on Cuba's part will be answered with a meaningful American response. The goal of the United States policy toward Cuba is not a permanent embargo on Cuba's economy. The goal is freedom for Cuba's people. Today's initiative invites the Cuban Government to trust and respect Cuban citizens. And I urge other democracies, in this hemisphere and beyond, to use their influence on Cuba's Government to allow free and fair National Assembly elections and to push for real and meaningful and verifiable reform. Full normalization of relations with Cuba—diplomatic recognition, open trade, and a robust aid program—will only be possible when Cuba has a new government that is fully democratic, when the rule of law is respected, and when the human rights of all Cubans are fully protected. Yet, under the Initiative for a New Cuba, the United States recognizes that freedom sometimes grows step by step, and we'll encourage those steps. The current of history runs strongly toward freedom. Our plan is to accelerate freedom's progress in Cuba in every way possible, just as the United States and our democratic friends and allies did successfully in places like Poland or in South Africa. Even as we seek to end tyranny, we will work to make life better for people living under and resisting Castro's rule. Today I'm announcing a series of actions that will directly benefit the Cuban people and give them greater control of their economic and political destiny. My administration will ease restrictions on humanitarian assistance by legitimate U.S. religious and other nongovernmental organizations that directly serve the needs of the Cuban people and will help build Cuban civil society. And the United States will provide such groups with direct assistance that can be used for humanitarian and entrepreneurial activities. Our Government will offer scholarships in the United States for Cuban students and professionals who try to build independent civil institutions in Cuba and scholarships for family members of political prisoners. We are willing to negotiate direct mail service between the United States and Cuba. My administration will also continue to look for ways to modernize Radio and TV Marti, because even the strongest walls of oppression cannot stand when the floodgates of information and knowledge are opened. And in the months ahead, my administration will continue to work with leaders all around our country, leaders who love freedom for Cuba, to implement new ways to empower individuals to enhance the chance for freedom. The United States will continue to enforce economic sanctions on Cuba and the ban on travel to Cuba until Cuba's Government proves that it is committed to real reform. We will continue to prohibit U.S. financing for Cuban purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, because this would just be a foreign aid program in disguise, which would benefit the current regime. Today's initiative offers Cuba's Government a different path leading to a different future, a future of greater democracy and prosperity and respect. With real reform in Cuba, our countries can begin chipping away at four decades of distrust and division. And the choice rests with Mr. Castro. Today, there is only one nation in our hemisphere that is not a democracy—only one. There is only one national leader whose position of power owes more to bullets than ballots. Fidel Castro has a chance to escape this lonely and stagnant isolation. If he accepts our offer, he can bring help to his people and hope to our relations. If Mr. Castro refuses our offer, he will be protecting his cronies at the expense of his people. And eventually, despite all his tools of oppression, Fidel Castro will need to answer to his people. Jose Marti said, ""Barriers of ideas are stronger than barricades of stone."" For the benefit of Cuba's people, it is time for Mr. Castro to cast aside old and failed ideas and to start to think differently about the future. Today could mark a new dawn in a long friendship between our people, but only if the Castro regime sees the light. Cuba's independence was achieved a century ago. It was hijacked nearly half a century ago. Yet, the independent spirit of the Cuban people has never faltered, and it has never been stronger than it is today. The United States is proud to stand with all Cubans and all Cuban Americans who love freedom. And we will continue to stand with you until liberty returns to the land you love so well.

independence.', 'Today we honor the ties of friendship and family and faith that unite the Cuban people and the people of the United States.', 'We honor the contributions that Cuban Americans have made to all aspects of our national life.', 'And today I am issuing a proposal and a challenge that can put Cuba on the path to liberty.', 'I appreciate our Secretary of State being here.', 'He and I take this issue very seriously.', 'He loves freedom as much as I love freedom.', 'I want to thank Mel Martinez, a graduate of Pedro Pan, for being here.', ""Mr. Secretary, you're doing a great job."", 'Welcome.', 'I appreciate members of the diplomatic corps who are here.', ""Thank you all for coming; I'm honored to have you here."", 'I want to thank Senator George Allen from the Commonwealth of Virginia.', 'I want to thank Congressman Dan Burton; Mr. Chairman.', 'And of course, two great Members of the United States Congress, people who have got a lot to offer, a lot of sound advice: Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart.', 'Thank you all for coming.', ""Cuba's independence one century ago today was the inspiration of great thinkers such as Felix Varela."", 'It was the result of determination and talent on the part of a great statesman such as Jose Marti and great soldiers such as Antonio Maceo and Maximo Gomez.', ""Most of all, Cuba's independence was the product of the great courage and sacrifice of the Cuban people."", 'Today, and every day for the past 43 years, that legacy of courage has been insulted by a tyrant who uses brutal methods to enforce a bankrupt vision.', 'That legacy has been debased by a relic from another era who has turned a beautiful island into a prison.', 'In a career of oppression, Mr. Castro has imported nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, and he has exported his military forces to encourage civil war abroad.', 'He is a dictator who jails and tortures and exiles his political opponents.', 'We know this.', 'The Cuban people know this, and the world knows this.', ""After all, just a month ago the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in a resolution proposed by the nations of Latin America, called upon Cuba's Government to finally—to finally— begin respecting the human rights of its people."", ""Through all their pains and deprivation, the Cuban people's aspirations for freedom are undiminished."", 'We see this today in Havana, where more than 11,000 brave citizens have petitioned their Government for a referendum on basic freedoms.', 'If that referendum is allowed, it can be a prelude, a beginning for real change in Cuba.', 'The United States has no designs on Cuban sovereignty.', ""It's not a part of our strategy or a part of our vision."", 'In fact, the United States has been a strong and consistent supporter of freedom for the Cuban people.', 'And it is important for those who love freedom on that beautiful island to know that our support for them will never waver.', ""Today I'm announcing an Initiative for a New Cuba that offers Cuba's Government a way forward towards democracy and hope and better relations with the United States."", ""Cuba's scheduled to hold elections to its National Assembly in 2003."", 'Let me read Article 71 of the Cuban Constitution.', 'It says, ""The National Assembly is composed of deputies elected by free, direct, and secret vote.""', ""That's what the constitution says."", 'Yet since 1959, no election in Cuba has come close to meeting these standards.', ""In most elections, there has been one candidate, Castro's candidate."", ""All elections in Castro's Cuba have been a fraud."", 'The voices of the Cuban people have been suppressed, and their votes have been meaningless.', ""That's the truth."", 'Es la verdad.', 'In the 2003 National Assembly elections in Cuba, Cuba has the opportunity to offer Cuban voters the substance of democracy, not its hollow, empty forms.', 'Opposition parties should have the freedom to organize, assemble, and speak, with equal access to all airwaves.', 'All political prisoners must be released and allowed to participate in the election process.', 'Human rights organizations should be free to visit Cuba to ensure that the conditions for free elections are being created.', 'And the 2003 elections should be monitored by objective outside observers.', ""These are the minimum steps necessary to make sure that next year's elections are the true expression of the will of the Cuban people."", ""I also challenge Cuba's Government to ease its stranglehold, to change its stranglehold on private economic activity."", 'Political and economic freedoms go hand in hand, and if Cuba opens its political system, fundamental questions about its backward economic system will come into sharper focus.', 'If the Cuban Government truly wants to advance the cause of workers, of Cuban workers, surely it will permit trade unions to exist outside of Government control.', 'If Cuba wants to create more good-paying jobs, private employers have to be able to negotiate with and pay workers of their own choosing, without the Government telling who they can hire and who they must fire.', 'If Cuba wants to attract badly needed investment from abroad, property rights must be respected.', 'If the Government wants to improve the daily lives of its people, goods and services produced in Cuba should be made available to all Cuban citizens.', 'Workers employed by foreign companies should be paid directly by their employers, instead of having the Government seize their hard-currency wages and pass on a pittance in the form of pesos.', 'And the signs at hotels reading ""Solamente Turistas"" should finally be taken down.', 'Without major steps by Cuba to open up its political system and its economic system, trade with Cuba will not help the Cuban people.', ""It's important for Americans to understand: Without political reform, without economic reform, trade with Cuba will merely enrich Fidel Castro and his cronies."", 'Well-intentioned ideas about trade will merely prop up this dictator, enrich his cronies, and enhance the totalitarian regime.', 'It will not help the Cuban people.', 'With real political and economic reform, trade can benefit the Cuban people and allow them to share in the progress of our times.', ""If Cuba's Government takes all the necessary steps to ensure that the 2003 elections are certifiably free and fair—certifiably free and fair—and if Cuba also begins to adopt meaningful market-based reforms, then and only then I will work with the United States Congress to ease the ban on trade and travel between our two countries."", ""Meaningful reform on Cuba's part will be answered with a meaningful American response."", ""The goal of the United States policy toward Cuba is not a permanent embargo on Cuba's economy."", ""The goal is freedom for Cuba's people."", ""Today's initiative invites the Cuban Government to trust and respect Cuban citizens."", ""And I urge other democracies, in this hemisphere and beyond, to use their influence on Cuba's Government to allow free and fair National Assembly elections and to push for real and meaningful and verifiable reform."", 'Full normalization of relations with Cuba—diplomatic recognition, open trade, and a robust aid program—will only be possible when Cuba has a new government that is fully democratic, when the rule of law is respected, and when the human rights of all Cubans are fully protected.', ""Yet, under the Initiative for a New Cuba, the United States recognizes that freedom sometimes grows step by step, and we'll encourage those steps."", 'The current of history runs strongly toward freedom.', ""Our plan is to accelerate freedom's progress in Cuba in every way possible, just as the United States and our democratic friends and allies did successfully in places like Poland or in South Africa."", ""Even as we seek to end tyranny, we will work to make life better for people living under and resisting Castro's rule."", ""Today I'm announcing a series of actions that will directly benefit the Cuban people and give them greater control of their economic and political destiny."", 'My administration will ease restrictions on humanitarian assistance by legitimate U.S. religious and other nongovernmental organizations that directly serve the needs of the Cuban people and will help build Cuban civil society.', 'And the United States will provide such groups with direct assistance that can be used for humanitarian and entrepreneurial activities.', 'Our Government will offer scholarships in the United States for Cuban students and professionals who try to build independent civil institutions in Cuba and scholarships for family members of political prisoners.', 'We are willing to negotiate direct mail service between the United States and Cuba.', 'My administration will also continue to look for ways to modernize Radio and TV Marti, because even the strongest walls of oppression cannot stand when the floodgates of information and knowledge are opened.', 'And in the months ahead, my administration will continue to work with leaders all around our country, leaders who love freedom for Cuba, to implement new ways to empower individuals to enhance the chance for freedom.', ""The United States will continue to enforce economic sanctions on Cuba and the ban on travel to Cuba until Cuba's Government proves that it is committed to real reform."", 'We will continue to prohibit U.S. financing for Cuban purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, because this would just be a foreign aid program in disguise, which would benefit the current regime.', ""Today's initiative offers Cuba's Government a different path leading to a different future, a future of greater democracy and prosperity and respect."", 'With real reform in Cuba, our countries can begin chipping away at four decades of distrust and division.', 'And the choice rests with Mr. Castro.', 'Today, there is only one nation in our hemisphere that is not a democracy—only one.', 'There is only one national leader whose position of power owes more to bullets than ballots.', 'Fidel Castro has a chance to escape this lonely and stagnant isolation.', 'If he accepts our offer, he can bring help to his people and hope to our relations.', 'If Mr. Castro refuses our offer, he will be protecting his cronies at the expense of his people.', 'And eventually, despite all his tools of oppression, Fidel Castro will need to answer to his people.', 'Jose Marti said, ""Barriers of ideas are stronger than barricades of stone.""', ""For the benefit of Cuba's people, it is time for Mr. Castro to cast aside old and failed ideas and to start to think differently about the future."", 'Today could mark a new dawn in a long friendship between our people, but only if the Castro regime sees the light.', ""Cuba's independence was achieved a century ago."", 'It was hijacked nearly half a century ago.', 'Yet, the independent spirit of the Cuban people has never faltered, and it has never been stronger than it is today.', 'The United States is proud to stand with all Cubans and all Cuban Americans who love freedom.', 'And we will continue to stand with you until liberty returns to the land you love so well.', 'Viva Cuba Libre.']","['Bienvenidos.', 'Welcome', 'to', 'the',

"Good morning. I've just concluded a meeting of my National Security Council. We reviewed what I discussed with my friend President Vladimir Putin over the course of many meetings, many months. And that is the need for America to move beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Today I have given formal notice to Russia, in accordance with the treaty, that the United States of America is withdrawing from this almost 30-year-old treaty. I have concluded the ABM Treaty hinders our Government's ability to develop ways to protect our people from future terrorist or rogue state missile attacks. The 1972 ABM Treaty was signed by the United States and the Soviet Union at a much different time, in a vastly different world. One of the signatories, the Soviet Union, no longer exists, and neither does the hostility that once led both our countries to keep thousands of nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert, pointed at each other. The grim theory was that neither side would launch a nuclear attack because it knew the other would respond, thereby destroying both. Today, as the events of September the 11th made all too clear, the greatest threats to both our countries come not from each other or other big powers in the world but from terrorists who strike without warning or rogue states who seek weapons of mass destruction. We know that the terrorists and some of those who support them seek the ability to deliver death and destruction to our doorstep via missile. And we must have the freedom and the flexibility to develop effective defenses against those attacks. Defending the American people is my highest priority as Commander in Chief, and I cannot and will not allow the United States to remain in a treaty that prevents us from developing effective defenses. At the same time, the United States and Russia have developed a new, much more hopeful and constructive relationship. We are moving to replace mutually assured destruction with mutual cooperation. Beginning in Ljubljana and continuing in meetings in Genoa, Shanghai, Washington, and Crawford, President Putin and I developed common ground for a new strategic relationship. Russia is in the midst of a transition to free markets and democracy. We are committed to forging strong economic ties between Russia and the United States and new bonds between Russia and our partners in NATO. NATO has made clear its desire to identify and pursue opportunities for joint action at 20. I look forward to visiting Moscow to continue our discussions as we seek a formal way to express a new strategic relationship that will last long beyond our individual administrations, providing a foundation for peace for the years to come. We're already working closely together as the world rallies in the war against terrorism. I appreciate so much President Putin's important advice and cooperation as we fight to dismantle the Al Qaida network in Afghanistan. I appreciate his commitment to reduce Russia's offensive nuclear weapons. I reiterate our pledge to reduce our own nuclear arsenal between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed strategic nuclear weapons. President Putin and I have also agreed that my decision to withdraw from the treaty will not, in any way, undermine our new relationship or Russian security. As President Putin said in Crawford, we are on the path to a fundamentally different relationship. The cold war is long gone. Today we leave behind one of its last vestiges. But this is not a day for looking back. This is a day for looking forward with hope and anticipation of greater prosperity and peace for Russians, for Americans, and for the entire world.

"My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger. On my orders, coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein's ability to wage war. These are opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign. More than 35 countries are giving crucial support, from the use of naval and air bases, to help with intelligence and logistics, to the deployment of combat units. Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense. To all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces now in the Middle East, the peace of a troubled world and the hopes of an oppressed people now depend on you. That trust is well-placed. The enemies you confront will come to know your skill and bravery. The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military. In this conflict, America faces an enemy who has no regard for conventions of war or rules of morality. Saddam Hussein has placed Iraqi troops and equipment in civilian areas, attempting to use innocent men, women, and children as shields for his own military, a final atrocity against his people. I want Americans and all the world to know that coalition forces will make every effort to spare innocent civilians from harm. A campaign on the harsh terrain of a nation as large as California could be longer and more difficult than some predict. And helping Iraqis achieve a united, stable, and free country will require our sustained commitment. We come to Iraq with respect for its citizens, for their great civilization, and for the religious faiths they practice. We have no ambition in Iraq except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people. I know that the families of our military are praying that all those who serve will return safely and soon. Millions of Americans are praying with you for the safety of your loved ones and for the protection of the innocent. For your sacrifice, you have the gratitude and respect of the American people. And you can know that our forces will be coming home as soon as their work is done. Our Nation enters this conflict reluctantly. Yet our purpose is sure. The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder. We will meet that threat now with our Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and Marines, so that we do not have to meet it later with armies of firefighters and police and doctors on the streets of our cities. Now that conflict has come, the only way to limit its duration is to apply decisive force. And I assure you, this will not be a campaign of half measures, and we will accept no outcome but victory. My fellow citizens, the dangers to our country and the world will be overcome. We will pass through this time of peril and carry on the work of peace. We will defend our freedom.

"Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished citizens and fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the Union. This year, we gather in this Chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead. You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this session of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country. We have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease. We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared, and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people. In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. In a whirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is sure; our resolve is firm; and our Union is strong. This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other Presidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage. During the last 2 years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform, which must now be carried out in every school and in every classroom so that every child in America can read and learn and succeed in life. To protect our country, we reorganized our Government and created the Department of Homeland Security, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation. To insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough reforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account. Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I ask the House and the Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens. Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job. After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and stock market declines, our economy is recovering. Yet, it's not growing fast enough or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, our Nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more employers to put up the sign that says ""Help Wanted."" Jobs are created when the economy grows. The economy grows when Americans have more money to spend and invest, and the best and fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place. I am proposing that all the income-tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as I've signed the bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' paychecks. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to $1,000, we should send the checks to American families now. The tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes, and it will help our economy immediately. Ninety-two million Americans will keep, this year, an average of almost $1,100 more of their own money. A family of four with an income of $40,000 would see their Federal income taxes fall from $1,178 to $45 per year. Our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses. You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions and promised them for future years. If this tax relief is good for Americans 3 or 5 or 7 years from now, it is even better for Americans today. We should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws. It's fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits. To boost investor confidence and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends. Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More jobs mean more taxpayers and higher revenues to our Government. The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth and to show some spending discipline in Washington, DC. We must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4 percent next year, about as much as the average family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good benchmark for us. Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families. A growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will be crucial to the future of Social Security. As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own. Our second goal is high quality, affordable health for all Americans. The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation, with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medical care costs too much, and many have no health coverage at all. These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care. Instead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low-income Americans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyers and HMOs, we must put doctors and nurses and patients back in charge of American medicine. Health care reform must begin with Medicare. Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America. Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is. And just like you, the Members of Congress, and your staffs and other Federal employees, all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs. My budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare. I urge the Members of this new Congress to act this year. To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher cost, the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued. Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care, and many parts of America are losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit. I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform. Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country while dramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70-percent cut in air pollution from powerplants over the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millions of acres of treasured forests. I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our economy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined. In this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about not through endless lawsuits or command-and-control regulations but through technology and innovation. Tonight I'm proposing $1.2 billion in research funding so that America can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles. A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy which can be used to power a car, producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a new national commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom, so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollution-free. Join me in this important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy. Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America. For so many in our country, the homeless and the fatherless, the addicted, the need is great. Yet there's power, wonder-working power, in the goodness and idealism and faith of the American people. Americans are doing the work of compassion every day, visiting prisoners, providing shelter for battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors. These good works deserve our praise. They deserve our personal support, and when appropriate, they deserve the assistance of the Federal Government. I urge you to pass both my Faith-Based Initiative and the ""Citizen Service Act,"" to encourage acts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time. Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA Freedom Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America. Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of Government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens, boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad. I propose a $450 million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. Government will support the training and recruiting of mentors. Yet it is the men and women of America who will fill the need. One mentor, one person, can change a life forever, and I urge you to be that one person. Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds out friendship, ambition, moral conviction and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire. As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies and reducing demand through antidrug education programs. Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives. Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I propose a new $600 million program to help an additional 300,000 Americans receive treatment over the next 3 years. Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in the program said, ""God does miracles in people's lives, and you never think it could be you."" Tonight let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you. By caring for children who need mentors and for addicted men and women who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society, a culture that values every life. And in this work, we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of their birth and end the practice of partial-birth abortion. And because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I ask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning. The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests. Our Founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity, the rights of every person, and the possibilities of every life. This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted and defend the peace and confound the designs of evil men. In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people. And we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their children, boys and girls. In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine. Across the Earth, America is feeding the hungry. More than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the United States. As our Nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling as a blessed country is to make the world better. Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus, including 3 million children under the age 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than 4 million require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims—only 50,000—are receiving the medicine they need. Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, ""We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, ‘You've got AIDS. We can't help you. Go home and die.""' In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words. AIDS can be prevented. Antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And the cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year, which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many. We have confronted and will continue to confront HIV/AIDS in our own country. And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new AIDS infections, treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS and for children orphaned by AIDS. I ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next 5 years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean. This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature. And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the manmade evil of international terrorism. There are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror. There's never a day when I do not learn of another threat or receive reports of operations in progress or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes on, and we are winning. To date, we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of Al Qaida. They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11th attacks, the chief of Al Qaida operations in the Persian Gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in east Africa and the U.S.S. Cole, an Al Qaida operations chief from Southeast Asia, a former director of Al Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan, a key Al Qaida operative in Europe, a major Al Qaida leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way: They are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies. We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the Embassy in Yemen, the American Embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits of Gibraltar. We've broken Al Qaida cells in Hamburg, Milan, Madrid, London, Paris, as well as Buffalo, New York. We have the terrorists on the run. We're keeping them on the run. One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice. As we fight this war, we will remember where it began: Here, in our own country. This Government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland. We've intensified security at the borders and ports of entry, posted more than 50,000 newly trained Federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troops and first-responders against smallpox, and are deploying the Nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack. And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to field a defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles. I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bioterrorism, called Project Bio-Shield. The budget I send you will propose almost $6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before the dangers are upon us. Since September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence and is transforming itself to meet new threats. Tonight I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location. Our Government must have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our citizens. Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power. In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men; free people will set the course of history. Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation. This threat is new. America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America. Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this Nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility. America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We're strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world. We're working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction. In all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process; it is to achieve a result, the end of terrible threats to the civilized world. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attacks. And we're asking them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the course of this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others. Whatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American people. Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a Government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own Government and determine their own destiny, and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom. On the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that that regime was deceiving the world and developing those weapons all along. And today, the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed. America is working with the countries of the region, South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, to find a peaceful solution and to show the North Korean Government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship. The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions. Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States. Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons, not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. Almost 3 months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations and for the opinion of the world. The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct— were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed. Nothing like this has happened. The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax, enough doses to kill several million people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it. The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin, enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it. Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them. U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them. From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide. The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving. From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses. Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say. Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families. Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why? The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack. With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the American people must recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaida. Secretly and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own. Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses, and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans, this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes. Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option. The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages, leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained, by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have cataloged other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning. And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country; your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation. The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country and our friends and our allies. The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi's legal—Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors, and its links to terrorist groups. We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him. Tonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lay ahead. In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, and America believes in you. Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President can make. The technologies of war have changed; the risks and suffering of war have not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow. This Nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come. We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means, sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military, and we will prevail. And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom. Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In 2 years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril, from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right country. Americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world and to ourselves. America is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength. We exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers. Americans are a free people who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world; it is God's gift to humanity. We Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone. We do not know—we do not claim to know all the ways of providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life and all of history. May He guide us now. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.",address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-23.txt,4,mr speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished

against the threats of a new era to bring our economy out of recession we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation to insist on integrity in american business we passed tough reforms and we are holding corporate criminals to account some might call this a good record i call it a good start tonight i ask the house and the senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens our first goal is clear we must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job after recession terrorist attacks corporate scandals and stock market declines our economy is recovering yet it's not growing fast enough or strongly enough with unemployment rising our nation needs more small businesses to open more companies to invest and expand more

the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses you the congress have already passed all these reductions and promised them for future years if this tax relief is good for americans 3 or 5 or 7 years from now it is even better for americans today we should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws it's fair to tax a company's profits it is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits to boost investor confidence and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income i ask you to end the unfair double taxation of

400 billion over the next decade to reform and strengthen medicare leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening medicare i urge the members of this new congress to act this year to improve our health care system we must address one of the prime causes of higher cost the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued because of excessive litigation everybody pays more for health care and many parts of america are losing fine doctors no one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit i urge the congress to pass medical liability reform

there's power wonder working power in the goodness and idealism and faith of the american people americans are doing the work of compassion every day visiting prisoners providing shelter for battered women bringing companionship to lonely seniors these good works deserve our praise they deserve our personal support and when appropriate they deserve the assistance of the federal government i urge you to pass both my faith based initiative and the citizen service act to encourage acts of compassion that can transform america one heart and one soul at a time last year i called on my fellow citizens to participate in the usa freedom corps which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across america tonight i ask congress and the american people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad i propose a 450 million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners government will support the training and recruiting of mentors yet it is the men and women of america who will fill the need one mentor one person can change a life forever and i urge you to be that one person another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs addiction crowds out friendship ambition moral conviction and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire as a government we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies and reducing demand through antidrug education programs yet for those already addicted the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives too many americans in search of treatment cannot get it so tonight i propose a new 600 million program to help an additional 300 000 americans receive treatment over the next 3 years our nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work one of them is found at the healing place church in baton rouge louisiana a man in the program said god does miracles in people's lives and you never think it could be you tonight let us bring to all americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope the miracle of recovery is possible and it could be you by caring for children who need mentors and for addicted men and women who need treatment we are building a more welcoming society a culture that values every life and in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us i ask you to protect infants at the very hour of their birth and end the practice of partial birth abortion and because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment i ask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning the qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in america also determine our conduct abroad the american flag stands for more than our power and our interests our founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity the rights of every person and the possibilities of every life this conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted and defend the peace and confound the designs of evil men in afghanistan we helped to liberate an oppressed people and we will continue helping them secure their country rebuild their society and educate all their children boys and girls in the middle east we will continue to seek peace between a secure israel and a democratic palestine across the earth america is feeding the hungry more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the united states as our nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer we must also remember our calling as a blessed country is to make the world better today on the continent of africa nearly 30 million people have the aids virus including 3 million children under the age 15 there are whole countries in africa where more than one third of the adult population carries the infection more than 4 million require immediate drug treatment yet across that continent only 50 000 aids victims'only 50 000'are receiving the medicine they need because the aids diagnosis is considered a death sentence many do not seek treatment almost all who do are turned away a doctor in rural south africa describes his frustration he says we have no medicines many hospitals tell people 'you've got aids we can't help you go home and die ' in an age of miraculous medicines no person should have to hear those words aids can be prevented antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years and the cost of those drugs has dropped from 12 000 a year to under 300 a year which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp ladies and gentlemen seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many we have confronted and will continue to confront hiv aids in our own country and to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad tonight i propose the emergency plan for aids relief a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of africa this comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new aids infections treat at least 2 million people with life extending drugs and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from aids and for children orphaned by aids i ask the congress to commit 15 billion over the next 5 years including nearly 10 billion in new money to turn the tide against aids in the most afflicted nations of africa and the caribbean this nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature and this nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the manmade evil of international terrorism there are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror there's never a day when i do not learn of another threat or receive reports of operations in progress or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers the war goes on and we are winning to date we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of al qaida they include a man who directed logistics and funding for the september the 11th attacks the chief of al qaida operations in the persian gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in east africa and the u s s cole an al qaida operations chief from southeast asia a former director of al qaida's training camps in afghanistan a key al qaida operative in europe a major al qaida leader in yemen all told more than 3 000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries many others have met a different fate let's put it this way they are no longer a problem to the united states and our friends and allies we are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks america and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the embassy in yemen the american embassy in singapore a saudi military base ships in the straits of hormuz and the straits of gibraltar we've broken al qaida cells in hamburg milan madrid london paris as well as buffalo new york we have the terrorists on the run we're keeping them on the run one by one the terrorists are learning the meaning of american justice as we fight this war we will remember where it began here in our own country this government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland we've intensified security at the borders and ports of entry posted more than 50 000 newly trained federal screeners in airports begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox and are deploying the nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack and this year for the first time we are beginning to field a defense to protect this nation against ballistic missiles i thank the congress for supporting these measures i ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bioterrorism called project bio shield the budget i send you will propose almost 6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax botulinum toxin ebola and plague we must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons and we must act before the dangers are upon us since september the 11th our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists the fbi is improving its ability to analyze intelligence and is transforming itself to meet new threats tonight i am instructing the leaders of the fbi the cia the homeland security and the department of defense to develop a terrorist threat integration center to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location our government must have the very best information possible and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our citizens our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power in the ruins of two towers at the western wall of the pentagon on a field in pennsylvania this nation made a pledge and we renew that pledge tonight whatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulties we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men free people will set the course of history today the gravest danger in the war on terror the gravest danger facing america and the world is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear chemical and biological weapons these regimes could use such weapons for blackmail terror and mass murder they could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies who would use them without the least hesitation this threat is new america's duty is familiar throughout the 20th century small groups of men seized control of great nations built armies and arsenals and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world in each case their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit in each case the ambitions of hitlerism militarism and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples by the strength of great alliances and by the might of the united states of america now in this century the ideology of power and domination has appeared again and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror once again this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaos and constant alarm once again we are called to defend the safety of our people and the hopes of all mankind and we accept this responsibility america is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers we have called on the united nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that iraq disarm we're strongly supporting the international atomic energy agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world we're working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former soviet union and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction in all these efforts however america's purpose is more than to follow a process it is to achieve a result the end of terrible threats to the civilized world all free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attacks and we're asking them to join us and many are doing so yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others whatever action is required whenever action is necessary i will defend the freedom and security of the american people different threats require different strategies in iran we continue to see a government that represses its people pursues weapons of mass destruction and supports terror we also see iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy iranians like all people have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny and the united states supports their aspirations to live in freedom on the korean peninsula an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation throughout the 1990s the united states relied on a negotiated framework to keep north korea from gaining nuclear weapons we now know that that regime was deceiving the world and developing those weapons all along and today the north korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions america and the world will not be blackmailed america is working with the countries of the region south korea japan china and russia to find a peaceful solution and to show the north korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation economic stagnation and continued hardship the north korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the korean peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in iraq a brutal dictator with a history of reckless aggression with ties to terrorism with great potential wealth will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the united states twelve years ago saddam hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost to spare himself he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction for the next 12 years he systematically violated that agreement he pursued chemical biological and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons not economic sanctions not isolation from the civilized world not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities almost 3 months ago the united nations security council gave saddam hussein his final chance to disarm he has shown instead utter contempt for the united nations and for the opinion of the world the 108 u n inspectors were sent to conduct'were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of california the job of the inspectors is to verify that iraq's regime is disarming it is up to iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons lay those weapons out for the world to see and destroy them as directed nothing like this has happened the united nations concluded in 1999 that saddam hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25 000 liters of anthrax enough doses to kill several million people he hasn't accounted for that material he's given no evidence that he has destroyed it the united nations concluded that saddam hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38 000 liters of botulinum toxin enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure he hasn't accounted for that material he's given no evidence that he has destroyed it our intelligence officials estimate that saddam hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin mustard and vx nerve agent in such quantities these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands he's not accounted for these materials he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them u s intelligence indicates that saddam hussein had upwards of 30 000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents inspectors recently turned up 16 of them despite iraq's recent declaration denying their existence saddam hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29 984 of these prohibited munitions he's given no evidence that he has destroyed them from three iraqi defectors we know that iraq in the late 1990s had several mobile biological weapons labs these are designed to produce germ warfare agents and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors saddam hussein has not disclosed these facilities he's given no evidence that he has destroyed them the international atomic energy agency confirmed in the 1990s that saddam hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production saddam hussein has not credibly explained these activities he clearly has much to hide the dictator of iraq is not disarming to the contrary he is deceiving from intelligence sources we know for instance that thousands of iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the u n inspectors sanitizing inspection sites and monitoring the inspectors themselves iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses iraq is blocking u 2 surveillance flights requested by the united nations iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview real scientists have been coached by iraqi officials on what to say intelligence sources indicate that saddam hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with u n inspectors in disarming iraq will be killed along with their families year after year saddam hussein has gone to elaborate lengths spent enormous sums taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction but why the only possible explanation the only possible use he could have for those weapons is to dominate intimidate or attack with nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons saddam hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the middle east and create deadly havoc in that region and this congress and the american people must recognize another threat evidence from intelligence sources secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists including members of al qaida secretly and without fingerprints he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own before september the 11th many in the world believed that saddam hussein could be contained but chemical agents lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans this time armed by saddam hussein it would take one vial one canister one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known we will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions politely putting us on notice before they strike if this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge all actions all words and all recriminations would come too late trusting in the sanity and restraint of saddam hussein is not a strategy and it is not an option the dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages leaving thousands of his own citizens dead blind or disfigured iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained by torturing children while their parents are made to watch international human rights groups have cataloged other methods used in the torture chambers of iraq electric shock burning with hot irons dripping acid on the skin mutilation with electric drills cutting out tongues and rape if this is not evil then evil has no meaning and tonight i have a message for the brave and oppressed people of iraq your enemy is not surrounding your country your enemy is ruling your country and the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation the world has waited 12 years for iraq to disarm america will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country and our friends and our allies the united states will ask the u n security council to convene on february the 5th to consider the facts of iraq's ongoing defiance of the world secretary of state powell will present information and intelligence about iraqi's legal'iraq's illegal weapons programs its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors and its links to terrorist groups we will consult but let there be no misunderstanding if saddam hussein does not fully disarm for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world we will lead a coalition to disarm him tonight i have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace members of the american armed forces many of you are assembling in or near the middle east and some crucial hours may lay ahead in those hours the success of our cause will depend on you your training has prepared you your honor will guide you you believe in america and america believes in you sending americans into battle is the most profound decision a president can make the technologies of war have changed the risks and suffering of war have not for the brave americans who bear the risk no victory is free from sorrow this nation fights reluctantly because we know the cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come we seek peace we strive for peace and sometimes peace must be defended a future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all if war is forced upon us we will fight in a just cause and by just means sparing in every way we can the innocent and if war is forced upon us we will fight with the full force and might of the united states military and we will prevail and as we and our coalition partners are doing in afghanistan we will bring to the iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom many challenges abroad and at home have arrived in a single season in 2 years america has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes and we go forward with confidence because this call of history has come to the right country americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time adversity has revealed the character of our country to the world and to ourselves america is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength we exercise power without conquest and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers americans are a free people who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation the liberty we prize is not america's gift to the world it is god's gift to humanity we americans have faith in ourselves but not in ourselves alone we do not know'we do not claim to know all the ways of providence yet we can trust in them placing our confidence in the loving god behind all of life and all of history may he guide us now and may god continue to bless the united states of america ,<nrclex.NRCLex object at

lives abroad from a terrible disease.', 'We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared, and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people.', 'In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident.', 'In a whirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is sure; our resolve is firm; and our Union is strong.', 'This country has many challenges.', 'We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other Presidents, and other generations.', 'We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.', 'During the last 2 years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together.', 'To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform, which must now be carried out in every school and in every classroom so that every child in America can read and learn and succeed in life.', 'To protect our country, we reorganized our Government and created the Department of Homeland Security, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era.', 'To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation.', 'To insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough reforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account.', 'Some might call this a good record.', 'I call it a good start.', 'Tonight I ask the House and the Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens.', 'Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job.', 'After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and stock market declines, our economy is recovering.', ""Yet, it's not growing fast enough or strongly enough."", 'With unemployment rising, our Nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more employers to put up the sign that says ""Help Wanted.""', 'Jobs are created when the economy grows.', 'The economy grows when Americans have more money to spend and invest, and the best and fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place.', 'I am proposing that all the income-tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year.', ""And under my plan, as soon as I've signed the bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' paychecks."", 'Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now.', 'Instead of slowly raising the child credit to $1,000, we should send the checks to American families now.', 'The tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes, and it will help our economy immediately.', 'Ninety-two million Americans will keep, this year, an average of almost $1,100 more of their own money.', 'A family of four with an income of $40,000 would see their Federal income taxes fall from $1,178 to $45 per year.', 'Our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses.', 'You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions and promised them for future years.', 'If this tax relief is good for Americans 3 or 5 or 7 years from now, it is even better for Americans today.', 'We should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws.', ""It's fair to tax a company's profits."", 'It is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits.', 'To boost investor confidence and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends.', 'Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand.', 'More jobs mean more taxpayers and higher revenues to our Government.', 'The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth and to show some spending discipline in Washington, DC.', 'We must work together to fund only our most important priorities.', ""I will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4 percent next year, about as much as the average family's income is expected to grow."", 'And that is a good benchmark for us.', 'Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families.', 'A growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will be crucial to the future of Social Security.', 'As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own.', 'Our second goal is high quality, affordable health for all Americans.', 'The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation, with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives.', 'Yet for many people, medical care costs too much, and many have no health coverage at all.', 'These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care.', 'Instead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low-income Americans receive the help they need.', 'Instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyers and HMOs, we must put doctors and nurses and patients back in charge of American medicine.', 'Health care reform must begin with Medicare.', 'Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society.', 'We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America.', 'Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is.', 'And just like you, the Members of Congress, and your staffs and other Federal employees, all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs.', 'My budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare.', 'Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare.', 'I urge the Members of this new Congress to act this year.', 'To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher cost, the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued.', 'Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care, and many parts of America are losing fine doctors.', 'No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit.', 'I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.', 'Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country while dramatically improving the environment.', 'I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home.', 'I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70-percent cut in air pollution from powerplants over the next 15 years.', 'I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millions of acres of treasured forests.', 'I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our economy.', 'Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined.', 'In this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about not through endless lawsuits or command-and-control regulations but through technology and innovation.', ""Tonight I'm proposing $1.2 billion in research funding so that America can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles."", 'A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy which can be used to power a car, producing only water, not exhaust fumes.', 'With a new national commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom, so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollution-free.', 'Join me in this important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy.', 'Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America.', 'For so many in our country, the homeless and the fatherless, the addicted, the need is great.', ""Yet there's power, wonder-working power, in the goodness and idealism and faith of the American people."", 'Americans are doing the work of compassion every day, visiting prisoners, providing shelter for battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors.', 'These good works deserve our praise.', 'They deserve our personal support, and when appropriate, they deserve the assistance of the Federal Government.', 'I urge you to pass both my Faith-Based Initiative and the ""Citizen Service Act,"" to encourage acts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time.', 'Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA Freedom Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America.', 'Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of Government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens, boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad.', 'I propose a $450 million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners.', 'Government will support the training and recruiting of mentors.', 'Yet it is the men and women of America who will fill the need.', 'One mentor, one person, can change a life forever, and I urge you to be that one person.', 'Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs.', 'Addiction crowds out friendship, ambition, moral conviction and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire.', 'As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies and reducing demand through antidrug education programs.', 'Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives.', 'Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it.', 'So tonight I propose a new $600 million program to help an additional 300,000 Americans receive treatment over the next 3 years.', 'Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work.', 'One of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.', 'A man in the program said, ""God does miracles in people\'s lives, and you never think it could be you.""', 'Tonight let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you.', 'By caring for children who need mentors and for addicted men and women who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society, a culture that values every life.', 'And in this work, we must not overlook the weakest among us.', 'I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of their birth and end the practice of partial-birth abortion.', 'And because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I ask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning.', 'The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine our conduct abroad.', 'The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests.', 'Our Founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity, the rights of every person, and the possibilities of every life.', 'This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted and defend the peace and confound the designs of evil men.', 'In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people.', 'And we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their children, boys and girls.', 'In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine.', 'Across the Earth, America is feeding the hungry.', 'More than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the United States.', 'As our Nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling as a blessed country is to make the world better.', 'Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus, including 3 million children under the age 15.', 'There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection.', 'More than 4 million require immediate drug treatment.', 'Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims—only 50,000—are receiving the medicine they need.', 'Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment.', 'Almost all who do are turned away.', 'A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration.', 'He says, ""We have no medicines.', ""Many hospitals tell people, ‘You've got AIDS."", ""We can't help you."", 'Go home and die.""\'', 'In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words.', 'AIDS can be prevented.', 'Antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years.', 'And the cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year, which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.', 'We have confronted and will continue to confront HIV/AIDS in our own country.', 'And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa.', 'This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new AIDS infections, treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS and for children orphaned by AIDS.', 'I ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next 5 years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.', 'This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature.', 'And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the manmade evil of international terrorism.', 'There are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror.', ""There's never a day when I do not learn of another threat or receive reports of operations in progress or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers."", 'The war goes on, and we are winning.', ""To date, we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of Al Qaida."", 'They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11th attacks, the chief of Al Qaida operations in the Persian Gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in east Africa and the U.S.S.', ""Cole, an Al Qaida operations chief from Southeast Asia, a former director of Al Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan, a key Al Qaida operative in Europe, a major Al Qaida leader in Yemen."", 'All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries.', 'Many others have met a different fate.', ""Let's put it this way: They are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies."", 'We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks.', 'America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the Embassy in Yemen, the American Embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits of Gibraltar.', ""We've broken Al Qaida cells in Hamburg, Milan, Madrid, London, Paris, as well as Buffalo, New York."", 'We have the terrorists on the run.', ""We're keeping them on the run."", 'One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice.', 'As we fight this war, we will remember where it began: Here, in our own country.', 'This Government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland.', ""We've intensified security at the borders and ports of entry, posted more than 50,000 newly trained Federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troops and first-responders against smallpox, and are deploying the Nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack."", 'And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to field a defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles.', 'I thank the Congress for supporting these measures.', 'I ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bioterrorism, called Project Bio-Shield.', 'The budget I send you will propose almost $6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague.', 'We must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before the dangers are upon us.', 'Since September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists.', 'The FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence and is transforming itself to meet new threats.', 'Tonight I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location.', 'Our Government must have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our citizens.', 'Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power.', 'In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men; free people will set the course of history.', 'Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.', 'These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder.', 'They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation.', 'This threat is new.', ""America's duty is familiar."", 'Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world.', 'In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit.', 'In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America.', 'Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror.', 'Once again, this Nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaos and constant alarm.', 'Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people and the hopes of all mankind.', 'And we accept this responsibility.', 'America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers.', 'We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm.', ""We're strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world."", ""We're working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction."", ""In all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process; it is to achieve a result, the end of terrible threats to the civilized world."", 'All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attacks.', ""And we're asking them to join us, and many are doing so."", 'Yet the course of this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others.', 'Whatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American people.', 'Different threats require different strategies.', 'In Iran, we continue to see a Government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror.', 'We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy.', 'Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own Government and determine their own destiny, and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom.', 'On the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation.', 'Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons.', 'We now know that that regime was deceiving the world and developing those weapons all along.', 'And today, the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions.', 'America and the world will not be blackmailed.', 'America is working with the countries of the region, South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, to find a peaceful solution and to show the North Korean Government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship.', 'The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions.', 'Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq.', 'A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.', 'Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost.', 'To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction.', 'For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement.', 'He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while inspectors were in his country.', 'Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons, not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities.', 'Almost 3 months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm.', 'He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations and for the opinion of the world.', 'The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct— were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California.', ""The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming."", 'It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed.', 'Nothing like this has happened.', 'The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax, enough doses to kill several million people.', ""He hasn't accounted for that material."", ""He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it."", 'The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin, enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure.', ""He hasn't accounted for that material."", ""He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it."", 'Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent.', 'In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands.', ""He's not accounted for these materials."", 'He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.', 'U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents.', ""Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence."", 'Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions.', ""He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them."", 'From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs.', 'These are designed to produce germ warfare agents and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors.', 'Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities.', ""He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them."", 'The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb.', 'The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.', 'Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.', 'Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities.', 'He clearly has much to hide.', 'The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.', 'To the contrary, he is deceiving.', 'From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves.', 'Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.', 'Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations.', 'Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview.', 'Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say.', 'Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families.', 'Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction.', 'But why?', 'The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack.', 'With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region.', 'And this Congress and the American people must recognize another threat.', 'Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaida.', 'Secretly and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own.', 'Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained.', 'But chemical agents, lethal viruses, and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained.', 'Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans, this time armed by Saddam Hussein.', 'It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known.', 'We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes.', 'Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent.', 'Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike?', 'If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late.', 'Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option.', ""The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages, leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured."", 'Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained, by torturing children while their parents are made to watch.', 'International human rights groups have cataloged other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape.', 'If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning.', 'And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country; your enemy is ruling your country.', 'And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation.', 'The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm.', 'America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country and our friends and our allies.', ""The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world."", ""Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi's legal—Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors, and its links to terrorist groups."", 'We will consult.', 'But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.', 'Tonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lay ahead.', 'In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you.', 'Your training has prepared you.', 'Your honor will guide you.', 'You believe in America, and America believes in you.', 'Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President can make.', 'The technologies of war have changed; the risks and suffering of war have not.', 'For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow.', 'This Nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come.', 'We seek peace.', 'We strive for peace.', 'And sometimes peace must be defended.', 'A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all.', 'If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means, sparing, in every way we can, the innocent.', 'And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military, and we will prevail.', 'And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom.', 'Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season.', 'In 2 years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril, from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes.', 'And we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right country.', 'Americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time.', 'Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world and to ourselves.', 'America is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength.', 'We exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers.', 'Americans are a free people who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation.', ""The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world; it is God's gift to humanity."", 'We Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone.', 'We do not know—we do not claim to know all the ways of providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life and all of history.', 'May He guide us now.', 'And may God continue to bless the United States of America.']","['Mr.', 'Speaker', ',', 'Vice', 'President', 'Cheney', ',', 'Members', 'of', 'Congress', ',', 'distinguished', 'citizens', 'and', 'fellow',

"Abuse of Iraqi Prisoners at Abu Ghraib Prison Q. Mr. President, thank you for agreeing to do this interview with us. Evidence of torture of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. personnel has left many Iraqis and people in the Middle East and the Arab world with the impression that the United States is no better than Saddam Hussein regime. Especially when this alleged torture took place in the Abu Ghraib prison, a symbol of torture of—— The President. Yes. Q. What can the U.S. do, or what can you do to get out of this? The President. First, people in Iraq must understand that I view those practices as abhorrent. They must also understand that what took place in that prison does not represent America that I know. The America I know is a compassionate country that believes in freedom. The America I know cares about every individual. The America I know has sent troops into Iraq to promote freedom—good, honorable citizens that are helping the Iraqis every day. It's also important for the people of Iraq to know that in a democracy, everything is not perfect, that mistakes are made. But in a democracy as well those mistakes will be investigated, and people will be brought to justice. We're an open society. We're a society that is willing to investigate, fully investigate in this case, what took place in that prison. That stands in stark contrast to life under Saddam Hussein. His trained torturers were never brought to justice under his regime. There were no investigations about mistreatment of people. There will be investigations. People will be brought to justice. Media Coverage/Investigations Q. When did you learn about the—did you see the pictures on TV? When was the first time you heard about—— The President. Yes, the first time I saw or heard about pictures was on TV. However, as you might remember, in early January, General Kimmitt talked about a investigation that would be taking place about accused—alleged improprieties in the prison. So our Government has been in the process of investigating. And there are two—more than two investigations, multiple investigations going on, some of them related to any criminal charges that may be filed. And in our system of law, it's essential that those criminal charges go forward without prejudice. In other words, people need to be—are treated innocent until proven guilty. And facts are now being gathered. And secondly, there is investigations to determine how widespread abuse may be occurring, and we want to know the truth. I talked to the Secretary of Defense this morning, by the way. I said, ""Find the truth, and then tell the Iraqi people and the world the truth."" We have nothing to hide. We believe in transparency, because we're a free society. That's what free societies do. They—if there's a problem, they address those problems in a forthright, up-front manner. And that's what's taking place. Accountability Q. Mr. President, in a democracy and a free society, as you mentioned, people investigate, but at the same time, even those who are not directly responsible for these events take responsibility. With such a problem of this magnitude, do we expect anyone to step down? Do you still have confidence in the Secretary of Defense? The President. Oh, of course I've got confidence in the Secretary of Defense, and I've got confidence in the commanders on the ground in Iraq, because they and our troops are doing great work on behalf of the Iraqi people. We're finding the few that wanted to try to stop progress toward freedom and democracy. We're helping the Iraqi people stand up a government. We stand side by side with the Iraqis that love freedom. And—but people will be held to account. That's what the process does. That's what we do in America. We fully investigate. We let everybody see the results of the investigation, and then people will be held to account. Human Rights Abuses/International Red Cross Q. If your State Department issues a human rights report about practices around the world and abuses, and we call upon countries every once in a while to—— The President. Right. Q. ——try to put pressure on them to allow International Red Cross to visit prisons and detention center, would you allow the International Red Cross and other human rights organization to visit prisons under the control of the U.S. military? The President. Of course we'll cooperate with the International Red Cross. They're a vital organization, and we work with the International Red Cross. And you're right, we do point out human rights abuses. We also say to those governments, ""Clean up your act,"" and that's precisely what America is doing. We've discovered these abuses. They're abhorrent abuses. They do not reflect—the actions of these few people do not reflect the hearts of the American people. The American people are just as appalled at what they have seen on TV as the Iraqi citizens have. The Iraqi citizens must understand that. And therefore, there will be a full investigation, and justice will be served. And we will do to ourselves what we expect of others. And when we say, ""You've got human rights abuses, take care of the problem,"" we will do the same thing. We're taking care of the problem. And it's—it is unpleasant for Americans to see that some citizens, some soldiers have acted this way, because it does—again, I keep repeating, but it's true—it doesn't reflect how we think. This is not America. America is a country of justice and law and freedom and treating people with respect. Cooperation Within Iraq Q. Transferring control of Fallujah in Iraq to former army officers under Saddam Hussein led many people in Iraq and even in the Arab world to believe that the U.S. is lowering its expectation. The President. Yes. Q. How would you respond? The President. Quite the contrary. We're raising expectations. We believe the Iraqi people can self-govern, and we believe the Iraqi people have got the capacity to take care of people who are willing to terrorize innocent Iraqi citizens. And that's what you're seeing in Fallujah. As a matter of fact, the general in charge of the operation in Fallujah had been imprisoned by Sad-dam Hussein. So he felt the vindictiveness of the Hussein regime. And I've got confidence that Iraq will be a peaceful, self-governing nation. And I also have confidence that, with help, the Iraqi security forces will be strong against foreign terrorists and others who are willing to kill and criminals who are willing to try to wreak havoc in this society. Listen, there are thousands of Iraqi—innocent Iraqis who are dying at the hands of these killers. And we want to help decent, honorable Iraqi citizens bring peace and security to Iraq. Q. So there is no reversal in policy of de-Ba'athification? The President. Oh, no. There are citizens, for example, in the—amongst the teacher ranks in Sunni—parts of Sunni Iraq that were denied the right to teach because they may have been affiliated with the Ba'athist Party in the past but who are very important to the future of Iraq because they're teachers. And of course, they are now being let back in the classroom, not to spread political propaganda but to teach, to teach children. And obviously, there is a process of balancing those who may have been affiliated with the Ba'ath Party and those who are terrorists and killers. And obviously, terrorists and killers and extremists will not be a part of the Government, but people who are by and large peaceful people, who care deeply about the future of Iraq, will be. And that's what you're seeing taking place now. Progress in Iraq/Transfer of Sovereignty Q. It's been over a year since Saddam Hussein's regime has toppled down, and U.S. allies are in place right now in Iraq. What is your assessment, today, of U.S. allies and the Governing Council and the various factions of the Iraqi Government? The President. Yes, well, first, I think we've made a lot of progress in a year. Q. Do you still trust them? Do you still—— The President. Well, I trust the Iraqi people, let me put it to you that way. I believe the Iraqi people want to be free. By far, the vast majority of Iraqi citizens want to have a life that is peaceful, so they can raise their children, see that their children are educated, have a chance for their children to succeed. The businesspeople of Iraq just want a stable environment for them to be able to run their businesses and make a living. People want jobs. I mean, there are normal aspirations in Iraq that give me great confidence in the future of Iraq. People aspire for the same thing in Iraq as we do in America, a chance to succeed. I also have confidence that the process we're under will work, which is to transfer sovereignty on June 30th. The people of Iraq must understand, sovereignty will be transferred on June 30th. And there's a process now in place to make sure that there's an entity to which we transfer sovereignty. And then there will be elections. And I think the timetable we're on is a realistic timetable. It's one that will be met, and I believe that the elections will help the Iraqi citizens realize that freedom is coming. Israeli Disengagement Plan Q. If I may ask you my final question on the issue of the peace efforts that you are conducting, you supported Prime Minister Sharon's plan to withdraw from Gaza, and you sent senior officials to Israel, and Israeli officials came to Washington and negotiated that plan. Do you think it was a mistake to support a plan before the Prime Minister secured the support of his own party? The President. I think when you see a step toward peace, it's important for a peaceful nation like America to embrace it. And I felt that a withdrawal from the Gaza by the Israeli Prime Minister as well as the withdrawal from four settlements from the West Bank by the Israeli Prime Minister was a step toward peace. And at the time he did so, I called for the United States and others to seize this moment— the Quartet and the European Union and Russia and the United Nations and, hopefully, the World Bank, to seize this moment and to help the development of a Palestinian state that will be at peace with its neighbors, a Palestinian state that will provide hope for long-suffering Palestinian people. I think this is an historic moment for the world. I think this is a good opportunity to step forth. I am confident that a peaceful Palestinian state can emerge. I'm the first President ever to call for the establishment of a Palestinian state. I still feel strongly that there should be one. I also recognize that we have got a duty, all of us, to fight off the terrorists who are trying to stop the spread of a peaceful Palestinian state or the creation of a Palestinian state. And now is the time to make progress, and I believe we can. There was a good statement yesterday out of the Quartet that confirmed our desire for a Palestinian state to emerge. And it's—what the Prime Minister of Israel did was—took a political risk; obviously he did. I mean, his own party condemned the statement—condemned the policy. However, I still believe it was the right thing for him to do, and we support peace in the Middle East. And we support the vision of two states living side by side in peace. Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. The President. Good job.",interview-with-alhurra-television.txt,23,abuse of iraqi prisoners at abu ghraib prison q mr president thank you for agreeing to do this interview with us evidence of torture of iraqi

government has been in the process of investigating and there are two'more than two investigations multiple investigations going on some of them related to any criminal charges that may be filed and in our system of law it's essential that those criminal charges go forward without prejudice in other words people need to be'are treated innocent until proven guilty and facts are now being gathered

great work on behalf of the iraqi people we're finding the few that wanted to try to stop progress toward freedom and democracy we're helping the iraqi people stand up a government we stand side by side with the iraqis that love freedom and'but people will be held to account that's what the process does that's what we do in america we fully investigate we let everybody see the results of the investigation and then people will be held to account human rights abuses international red cross q if your state department issues a human rights report about practices around the world and abuses and we call upon countries every once in a while to''the president right q ''try to put pressure on them to allow international red cross to visit prisons and detention center would you allow the international red cross and other human rights organization to visit prisons under the control of the u s military the president of course we'll cooperate with the international red cross they're a vital organization and we work with the international red cross and you're right we do point out human rights abuses we also say to those governments clean up your act and that's precisely what america is doing we've discovered these abuses they're abhorrent abuses they do not reflect'the actions of these few people do not reflect the hearts of the american people the american people are just as appalled at what they have seen on tv as the iraqi citizens have the iraqi citizens must understand that and therefore there will be a full investigation and justice will be served and we will

"""As a result of private research, more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist"" I have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines "" where the life and death decision has already been made"", This allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research"" without crossing a fundamental moral line by providing taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potential for life."" -- George W. Bush Federal funding of research using existing embryonic stem cell lines is consistent with the President's belief in the fundamental value and sanctity of human life. The President's decision reflects his fundamental commitment to preserving the value and sanctity of human life and his desire to promote vital medical research. The President's decision will permit federal funding of research using the more than 60 existing stem cell lines that have already been derived, but will not sanction or encourage the destruction of additional human embryos. The embryos from which the existing stem cell lines were created have already been destroyed and no longer have the possibility of further development as human beings. Federal funding of medical research on these existing stem cell lines will promote the sanctity of life "" without undermining it "" and will allow scientists to explore the potential of this research to benefit the lives of millions of people who suffer from life destroying diseases. Federal funds will only be used for research on existing stem cell lines that were derived:     (1) with the informed consent of the donors;   (2) from excess embryos created solely for reproductive purposes; and   (3) without any financial inducements to the donors.  In order to ensure that federal funds are used to support only stem cell research that is scientifically sound, legal, and ethical, the NIH will examine the derivation of all existing stem cell lines and create a registry of those lines that satisfy this criteria. More than 60 existing stem cell lines from genetically diverse populations around the world are expected to be available for federally-funded research. No federal funds will be used for:     (1) the derivation or use of stem cell lines derived from newly destroyed embryos;   (2) the creation of any human embryos for research purposes; or   (3) the cloning of human embryos for any purpose.  Today's decision relates only to the use of federal funds for research on existing stem cell lines derived in accordance with the criteria set forth above. The President will create a new President's Council on Bioethics, chaired by Dr. Leon Kass, an expert in biomedical ethics and a professor at the University of Chicago, to study the human and moral ramifications of developments in biomedical and behaviorial science and technology. The Council will study such issues as embryo and stem cell research, assisted reproduction, cloning, genetic screening, gene therapy, euthanasia, psychoactive drugs, and brain implants.  BACKGROUND  Embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells, which come from the inner cell mass of a human embryo, have the potential to develop into all or nearly all of the tissues in the body. The scientific term for this characteristic is ""pluripotentiality."" Adult stem cells. Adult stem cells are unspecialized, can renew themselves, and can become specialized to yield all of the cell types of the tissue from which they originate. Although scientists believe that some adult stem cells from one tissue can develop into cells of another tissue, no adult stem cell has been shown in culture to be pluripotent. The potential of embryonic stem cell research. Many scientists believe that embryonic stem cell research may eventually lead to therapies that could be used to treat diseases that afflict approximately 128 million Americans. Treatments may include replacing destroyed dopamine-secreting neurons in a Parkinson's patient's brain; transplanting insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells in diabetic patients; and infusing cardiac muscle cells in a heart damaged by myocardial infarction. Embryonic stem cells may also be used to understand basic biology and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new medicines. The creation of embryonic stem cells. To create embryonic stem cells for research, a ""stem cell line"" must be created from the inner cell mass of a week-old embryo. If they are cultured properly, embryonic stem cells can grow and divide indefinitely. A stem cell line is a mass of cells descended from the original, sharing its genetic characteristics. Batches of cells can then be separated from the cell line and distributed to researchers. The origin of embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells are derived from excess embryos created in the course of infertility treatment. As a result of standard in vitro fertilization practices, many excess human embryos are created. Participants in IVF treatment must ultimately decide the disposition of these excess embryos, and many individuals have donated their excess embryos for research purposes. Existing stem cell lines. There are currently more than 60 existing different human embryonic stem cell lines that have been developed from excess embryos created for in vitro fertilization with the consent of the donors and without financial inducement. These existing lines are used in approximately one dozen laboratories around the world (in the United States, Australia, India, Israel, and Sweden). Therapies from adult and embryonic stem cell research. To date, adult stem cell research, which is federally-funded, has resulted in the development of a variety of therapeutic treatments for diseases. Although embryonic stem cell research has not yet produced similar results, many scientists believe embryonic stem cell research holds promise over time because of the capacity of embryonic stem cells to develop into any tissue in the human body.",fact-sheet-embryonic-stem-cell-research.txt,19, as a result of private research more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist i have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines where the life and death decision has already been made this allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line by providing taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potential for life george w bush federal funding of research using existing embryonic stem cell lines is consistent with the president's belief in the fundamental value and sanctity of human life the president's decision reflects his fundamental commitment to preserving the value and sanctity of human life and his desire to promote vital medical research the president's decision will permit federal funding of research using the more than 60 existing stem cell lines that have already been derived but will not sanction or encourage the destruction of additional human embryos the embryos from which the existing stem cell lines were created have already been destroyed and no longer have the possibility of further development as human beings federal funding of medical research on these existing stem cell lines will promote the sanctity of life without undermining it and will allow scientists to explore the potential of this research to benefit the lives of millions of people who suffer from life destroying diseases federal funds will only be used for research on existing stem cell lines that were derived 1 with the informed consent of the donors 2 from excess embryos created solely for reproductive purposes and 3 without any financial inducements to the donors in order to ensure that federal funds are used to support only stem cell research that is scientifically sound legal and ethical the nih will examine the derivation of all existing stem cell lines and create a registry of those lines that satisfy this criteria more than 60 existing stem cell lines from genetically diverse populations around the world are expected to be available for federally funded research no federal funds will be used for 1 the derivation or use of stem cell lines derived from newly destroyed embryos 2 the creation of any human embryos for research purposes or 3 the cloning of human embryos for any purpose today's decision relates only to the use of federal funds for research on existing stem cell lines derived in accordance with the criteria set forth above the president will create a new president's council on bioethics chaired by dr leon kass an expert in biomedical ethics and a professor at the university of chicago to study the human and moral ramifications of developments in biomedical and behaviorial science and technology the council will study such issues as embryo and stem cell research assisted reproduction cloning genetic screening gene therapy euthanasia psychoactive drugs and brain implants background embryonic stem cells embryonic stem cells which come from the inner cell mass of a human embryo have the potential to develop into all or nearly all of the tissues in the body the scientific term for this characteristic is pluripotentiality adult stem cells adult stem cells are unspecialized can renew themselves and can become specialized to yield all of the cell types of the tissue from which they originate although scientists believe that some adult stem cells from one tissue can develop into cells of another tissue no adult stem cell has been shown in culture to be pluripotent the potential of embryonic stem cell research many scientists believe that embryonic stem cell research may eventually lead to therapies that could be used to treat diseases that afflict approximately 128 million americans treatments may include replacing destroyed dopamine secreting neurons in a parkinson's patient's brain transplanting insulin producing pancreatic beta cells in diabetic patients and infusing cardiac muscle cells in a heart damaged by myocardial infarction embryonic stem cells may also be used to understand basic biology and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new medicines the creation of embryonic stem cells to create embryonic stem cells for research a stem cell line must be created from the inner cell mass of a week old embryo if they are cultured properly embryonic stem cells can grow and divide indefinitely a stem cell line is a mass of cells descended from the original sharing its genetic characteristics batches of cells can then be separated from the cell line and distributed to researchers the origin of embryonic stem cells embryonic stem cells are derived from excess embryos created in the course of infertility treatment as a result of standard in vitro fertilization practices many excess human embryos are created participants in ivf treatment must ultimately decide the disposition of these excess embryos and many individuals have donated their excess embryos for research purposes existing stem cell lines there are currently more than 60 existing different human embryonic stem cell lines that have been developed from excess embryos created for in vitro fertilization with the consent of the donors and without financial inducement these existing lines are used in approximately one dozen laboratories around the world in the united states

"Thank you all for coming. Laura and I are honored to be here. Over the past 4 years, America has benefited from the wise counsel of Dr. Condoleezza Rice and our family has been enriched by our friendship with this remarkable person. We love her. I don't know if you're supposed to say that about the Secretary of State.  Condi—appointment and confirmation of Secretary of State marks a remarkable transition in what is already a career of outstanding service and accomplishment. Today also marks an opportunity to honor another career defined by service and accomplishment. Throughout a lifetime spent in public service, Colin Powell has asked nothing in return. For over four decades, millions at home and abroad have benefited from his bravery, his dignity, and his integrity. He's left our Nation a better place than it was when he began his career in public service as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. His magnificent wife, Alma, I am certain is pleased that a grateful nation is giving back her husband——and all of us admire and appreciate the service of Colin Powell. I appreciate the fact that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg administered the oath. It was neighborly of her to do that.  I want to thank Congresswoman Jane Harman from California for joining us, as well as Juanita Millender-McDonald from California. We're honored you both are here. Thanks for taking time to honor your fellow Californian, Condi Rice. I see sitting between you two is a fine American in Andrew Young. Welcome, Andy. Thank you for coming. I shouldn't start going around the room heralding all the——accomplished souls who are here. I do want to thank members of the diplomatic corps for coming. I appreciate Your Excellencies taking time to honor Condi. I want to thank the distinguished guests and members—folks who work at the State Department for joining us as well. It's a good thing to come and honor your new boss——good diplomacy—. Colin Powell leaves big shoes to fill at the State Department, but Condi Rice is the right person to fill them. As National Security Adviser, she has led during a time when events not of our choosing have forced America to the leading edge of history. Condi has an abiding belief in the power of democracy to secure justice and liberty and the inclusion of men and women of all races and religions in the courses that free nations chart for themselves. A few days from now, these convictions will be confirmed by the Iraqi people when they cast their ballots in Iraq's first free elections in generations. Sunday's election is the first step in a process that will allow Iraqis to write and pass a constitution that enshrines self-government and the rule of law. This history is changing the world, because the advent of democracy in Iraq will serve as a powerful example to reformers throughout the entire Middle East. On Sunday, the Iraqi people will be joining millions in other parts of the world who now decide their future through free votes. In Afghanistan, the people have voted in the first free Presidential elections in that nation's 5,000-year history. The people of Ukraine have made clear their own desire for democracy. The Palestinians have just elected a new President who has repudiated violence. Freedom is on the march, and the world is better for it. Widespread hatred and radicalism cannot survive the advent of freedom and self-government. Our Nation will be more secure, the world will be more peaceful as freedom advances. Condi Rice understands that. And the terrorists understand that as well, and that is why they are now attacking Iraqi civilians in an effort to sabotage elections. We applaud the courage of ordinary Iraqis for their refusal to surrender their future to these killers. No nation can build a safer and better world alone. The men and women of the State Department are doing a fine job of working with other nations to build on the momentum of freedom. I know our Nation will be really well served when the good folks at the State Department join with Condi Rice to face the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. In the coming months and years, we must stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons and materials. We must safeguard and expand the freedom of international marketplace and free trade. We must advance justice and fundamental human rights. We must fight HIV/AIDS and other diseases and reduce poverty. Each task will require good relations with nations around the world, and each will require a Secretary who will lead by character and conviction and wisdom. To meet these times and tasks, America has its best in Dr. Condoleezza Rice, now Secretary Condoleezza Rice, our 66th Secretary of State.

"Good morning. For years, America's automakers have faced serious challenges: burdensome costs, a shrinking share of the market, and declining profits. In recent months, the global financial crisis has made these challenges even more severe. Now some U.S. auto executives say that their companies are nearing collapse and that the only way they can buy time to restructure is with help from the Federal Government. This is a difficult situation that involves fundamental questions about the proper role of Government. On the one hand, Government has a responsibility not to undermine the private enterprise system. On the other hand, Government has a responsibility to safeguard the broader health and stability of our economy. Addressing the challenges in the auto industry requires us to balance these two responsibilities. If we were to allow the free market to take its course now, it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers. Under ordinary economic circumstances, I would say this is the price that failed companies must pay, and I would not favor intervening to prevent the automakers from going out of business. But these are not ordinary circumstances. In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession, allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action. The question is how we can best give it a chance to succeed. Some argue the wisest pass—wisest path is to allow the auto companies to reorganize through chapter 11 provisions of our bankruptcy laws and provide Federal loans to keep them operating while they try to restructure under the supervision of a bankruptcy court. But given the current state of the auto industry and the economy, chapter 11 is unlikely to work for American auto-makers at this time. American consumers understand why: If you hear that a car company is suddenly going into bankruptcy, you worry that parts and servicing will not be available, and you question the value of your warranty. And with consumers hesitant to buy new cars from struggling automakers, it would be more difficult for auto companies to recover. Additionally, the financial cross—crisis brought the auto companies to the brink of bankruptcy much faster than they could have anticipated. And they have not made the legal and financial preparations necessary to carry out an orderly bankruptcy proceeding that could lead to a successful restructuring. The convergence of these factors means there is too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly liquidation of American auto companies. My economic advisers believe that such a collapse would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworking Americans far beyond the auto industry. It would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis. It could send our suffering economy into a deeper and longer recession, and it would leave the next President to confront the demise of a major American industry in his first days of office. A more responsible option is to give the auto companies an incentive to restructure outside of bankruptcy and a brief window in which to do it. And that is why my administration worked with Congress on a bill to provide automakers with loans to stave off bankruptcy while they develop plans for viability. This legislation earned bipartisan support from majorities in both Houses of Congress. Unfortunately, despite extensive debate and agreement that we should prevent disorderly bankruptcies in the American auto industry, Congress was unable to get a bill to my desk before adjourning this year. This means the only way to avoid a collapse of the U.S. auto industry is for the executive branch to step in. The American people want the auto companies to succeed, and so do I. So today I'm announcing that the Federal Government will grant loans to auto companies under conditions similar to those Congress considered last week. These loans will provide help in two ways. First, they will give automakers 3 months to put in place plans to restructure into viable companies, which we believe they are capable of doing. Second, if restructuring cannot be accomplished outside of bankruptcy, the loans will provide time for companies to make the legal and financial preparations necessary for an orderly chapter 11 process that offers a better prospect of long-term success and gives consumers confidence that they can continue to buy American cars. Because Congress failed to make funds available for these loans, the plan I am announcing today will be drawn from the financial rescue package Congress approved earlier this fall. The terms of the loans will require auto companies to demonstrate how they would become viable. They must pay back all their loans to the Government and show that their firms can earn a profit and achieve a positive net worth. This restructuring will require meaningful concessions from all involved in the auto industry: management, labor unions, creditors, bondholders, dealers, and suppliers. In particular, automakers must meet conditions that experts agree are necessary for long-term viability, including putting their retirement plans on a sustainable footing, persuading bondholders to convert their debt into capital the companies need to address immediate financial shortfalls, and making their compensation competitive with foreign automakers who have major operations in the United States. If a company fails to come up with a viable plan by March 31, it will be required to repay its Federal loans. The automakers and unions must understand what is at stake and make hard decisions necessary to reform. These conditions send a clear message to everyone involved in the future of American automakers: The time to make the hard decisions to become viable is now, or the only option will be bankruptcy. The actions I'm announcing today represent a step that we wish were not necessary. But given the situation, it is the most effective and responsible way to address this challenge facing our Nation. By giving the auto companies a chance to restructure, we will shield the American people from a harsh economic blow at a vulnerable time. And we will give American workers an opportunity to show the world once again they can meet challenges with ingenuity and determination and bounce back from tough times and emerge stronger than before. Thank you.",remarks-the-united-states-auto-industry-0.txt,62,good morning for years america's automakers have faced serious challenges burdensome costs a shrinking share of the market and declining

consumers understand why: If you hear that a car company is suddenly going into bankruptcy, you worry that parts and servicing will not be available, and you question the value of your warranty.', 'And with consumers hesitant to buy new cars from struggling automakers, it would be more difficult for auto companies to recover.', 'Additionally, the financial cross—crisis brought the auto companies to the brink of bankruptcy much faster than they could have anticipated.', 'And they have not made the legal and financial preparations necessary to carry out an orderly bankruptcy proceeding that could lead to a successful restructuring.', 'The convergence of these factors means there is too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly liquidation of American auto companies.', 'My economic advisers believe that such a collapse would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworking Americans far beyond the auto industry.', 'It would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis.', 'It could send our suffering economy into a deeper and longer recession, and it would leave the next President to confront the demise of a major American industry in his first days of office.', 'A more responsible option is to give the auto companies an incentive to restructure outside of bankruptcy and a brief window in which to do it.', 'And that is why my administration worked with Congress on a bill to provide automakers with loans to stave off bankruptcy while they develop plans for viability.', 'This legislation earned bipartisan support from majorities in both Houses of Congress.', 'Unfortunately, despite extensive debate and agreement that we should prevent disorderly bankruptcies in the American auto industry, Congress was unable to get a bill to my desk before adjourning this year.', 'This means the only way to avoid a collapse of the U.S. auto industry is for the executive branch to step in.', 'The American people want the auto companies to succeed, and so do I.', ""So today I'm announcing that the Federal Government will grant loans to auto companies under conditions similar to those Congress considered last week."", 'These loans will provide help in two ways.', 'First, they will give automakers 3 months to put in place plans to restructure into viable companies, which we believe they are capable of doing.', 'Second, if restructuring cannot be accomplished outside of bankruptcy, the loans will provide time for companies to make the legal and financial preparations necessary for an orderly chapter 11 process that offers a better prospect of long-term success and gives consumers confidence that they can continue to buy American cars.', 'Because Congress failed to make funds available for these loans, the plan I am announcing today will be drawn from the financial rescue package Congress approved earlier this fall.', 'The terms of the loans will require auto companies to demonstrate how they would become viable.', 'They must pay back all their loans to the Government and show that their firms can earn a profit and achieve a positive net worth.', 'This restructuring will require meaningful concessions from all involved in the auto industry: management, labor unions, creditors, bondholders, dealers, and suppliers.', 'In particular, automakers must meet conditions that experts agree are necessary for long-term viability, including putting their retirement plans on a sustainable footing, persuading bondholders to convert their debt into capital the companies need to address immediate financial shortfalls, and making their compensation competitive with foreign automakers who have major operations in the United States.', 'If a company fails to come up with a viable plan by March 31, it will be required to repay its Federal loans.', 'The automakers and unions must understand what is at stake and make hard decisions necessary to reform.', 'These conditions send a clear message to everyone involved in the future of American automakers: The time to make the hard decisions to become viable is now, or the only option will be bankruptcy.', ""The actions I'm announcing today represent a step that we wish were not necessary."", 'But given the situation, it is the most effective and responsible way to address this challenge facing our Nation.', 'By giving the auto companies a chance to restructure, we will shield the American people from a harsh economic blow at a vulnerable time.', 'And we will give American workers an opportunity to show the world once again they can meet challenges with ingenuity and determination and bounce back from tough times and emerge stronger than before.', 'Thank you.']","['Good', 'morning.', 'For', 'years', ',', 'America', ""'s"",

"Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I'm pleased that all of you have joined us as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 becomes the law of the land. For years, a terrible form of violence has been directed against children who are inches from birth, while the law looked the other way. Today, at last, the American people and our Government have confronted the violence and come to the defense of the innocent child. I want to thank you all for coming. Many of you have worked long and hard to see this bill come to fruition, and we thank you for your efforts. I see some members of my Cabinet have come. I appreciate the good work of the Attorney General, John Ashcroft. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson is here. Thank you, Tommy. There are a lot of Members of the Senate and House here today. I want to thank you all for passing this important legislation. I'm glad you're here. The primary Senate sponsor is with us, Senator Rick Santorum. Senator Orrin Hatch and Senator Mike DeWine helped as well in the Senate. Thank you all very much. Steve Chabot was the primary House sponsor, and Steve is with us. Thanks for coming, Steve. I'm thankful that our Speaker is with us today. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate you coming. The majority leader, Tom DeLay, as well— thank you for coming, Tom. I'd like to mention three other Members of the House. Henry Hyde is with us today. Mr. Chairman, we appreciate you coming. Jim Oberstar is with us. Jim, thank you for being here, sir. I appreciate you coming. Bart Stupak from Michigan is with us as well. Thanks for coming, Bart, glad you're here. I appreciate His Eminence, Cardinal Egan, who's with us today. Thank you very much, sir. In passing this legislation, Members of the House and Senate made a studied decision based upon compelling evidence. The best case against partial-birth abortion is a simple description of what happens and to whom it happens. It involves the partial delivery of a live boy or girl and a sudden, violent end of that life. Our Nation owes its children a different and better welcome. The bill I am about to sign protecting innocent new life from this practice reflects the compassion and humanity of America. In the course of the congressional debate, the facts became clear. Each year, thousands of partial-birth abortions are committed. As Dr. C. Everett Koop, the pediatrician and former Surgeon General, has pointed out, the majority of partial-birth abortions are not required by medical emergency. As Congress has found, the practice is widely regarded within the medical profession as unnecessary, not only cruel to the child but harmful to the mother and a violation of medical ethics. The facts about partial-birth abortion are troubling and tragic, and no lawyer's brief can make them seem otherwise. By acting to prevent this practice, the elected branches of our Government have affirmed a basic standard of humanity, the duty of the strong to protect the weak. The wide agreement amongst men and women on this issue, regardless of political party, shows that bitterness in political debate can be overcome by compassion and the power of conscience. And the executive branch will vigorously defend this law against any who would try to overturn it in the courts. America stands for liberty, for the pursuit of happiness, and for the unalienable right of life. And the most basic duty of Government is to defend the life of the innocent. Every person, however frail or vulnerable, has a place and a purpose in this world. Every person has a special dignity. This right to life cannot be granted or denied by Government, because it does not come from Government. It comes from the Creator of life. In the debate about the rights of the unborn, we are asked to broaden the circle of our moral concern. We're asked to live out our calling as Americans. We're asked to honor our own standards, announced on the day of our founding in the Declaration of Independence. We're asked by our convictions and tradition and compassion to build a culture of life and make this a more just and welcoming society. And today we welcome vulnerable children into the care and protection of Americans. The late Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey once said that when we look to the unborn child, the real issue is not when life begins but when love begins. This is the generous and merciful spirit of our country at its best. This spirit is reflected in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which I am now honored to sign into law. God bless. Thank you all.

other way.', 'Today, at last, the American people and our Government have confronted the violence and come to the defense of the innocent child.', 'I want to thank you all for coming.', 'Many of you

troubling and tragic, and no lawyer's brief can make them seem otherwise."", 'By acting to prevent this practice, the elected branches of our Government have affirmed a basic standard of humanity, the duty of the strong to protect the weak.', 'The wide agreement amongst men and women on this issue, regardless of political party, shows that bitterness in political debate can be overcome by compassion and the power of conscience.', 'And the executive branch will vigorously defend this law against any who would try to overturn it in the courts.', 'America stands for liberty, for the pursuit of happiness, and for the unalienable right of life.', 'And the most basic duty of Government is to defend the life of the innocent.', 'Every person, however frail or vulnerable, has a place

this a more just and welcoming society."", 'And today we welcome vulnerable children into the care and protection of Americans.', 'The late Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey once said that when we

"Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I take great joy in making this announcement. It's going to be one of the most important initiatives that my administration not only discusses but implements. First, it's good to have so many groups represented here: religious and nonreligious; Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and Muslim; foundations and other nonprofits. I want to thank you all for coming. This is a collection of some of the finest America has got to offer, people who lead with their hearts and, in turn, have changed the communities in which they live for the better. This meeting is a picture of the strength and diversity and compassion of our country. This is a diverse group, but we share things in common. They provide more than practical help to people in need; they touch and change hearts. And for this, America is deeply appreciative. Everyone in this room knows firsthand that there are still deep needs and real suffering in the shadow of America's affluence, problems like addiction and abandonment and gang violence, domestic violence, mental illness, and homelessness. We are called by conscience to respond. As I said in my Inaugural Address, compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. It is more than the calling of politicians; it is the calling of citizens. It is citizens who turn mean streets into good neighborhoods. It is citizens who turn cold cities into real communities. It is one of the great goals of my administration to invigorate the spirit of involvement and citizenship. We will encourage faith-based and community programs without changing their mission. We will help all in their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment to pluralism. I approach this goal with some basic principles. Government has important responsibilities for public health or public order and civil rights, and Government will never be replaced by charities and community groups. Yet when we see social needs in America, my administration will look first to faith-based programs and community groups, which have proven their power to save and change lives. We will not fund the religious activities of any group, but when people of faith provide social services, we will not discriminate against them. As long as there are secular alternatives, faith-based charities should be able to compete for funding on an equal basis and in a manner that does not cause them to sacrifice their mission. And we will make sure that help goes to large organizations and to small ones, as well. We value large organizations with generations of experience. We also value neighborhood healers, who have only the scars and testimony of their own experience. Tomorrow I will begin turning these principles into a legislative agenda. I will send to Congress a series of ideas and proposals. Today I want to raise the priority and profile of these issues within my own administration. I want to ensure that faithbased and community groups will always have a place at the table in our deliberations. In a few moments, I will sign two Executive orders. The first Executive order will create a new office called the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. The head of this office will report directly to me and be charged with important responsibilities. He will oversee our initiatives on this issue. He will make sure our Government, where it works with private groups, is fair and supportive. And he will highlight groups as national models so others can learn from them. The second Executive order will clear away the bureaucratic barriers in several important agencies that make private groups hesitate to work with Government. It will establish centers in five agencies— Justice, HUD, HHS, Labor, and Education—to ensure greater cooperation between the Government and the independent sector. These centers will report back on regulatory barriers to working with nonprofit groups and make recommendations on how those barriers can be removed. I have put this broad effort into the hands of two exceptional people—first, Steve Goldsmith, known as one of the most innovative mayors in America, who pioneered ways to promote community efforts. He will continue to advise me on these issues. And I have asked Steve to serve on the board of the Corporation for National Service. This organization has done some good work in mobilizing volunteers of all ages. I've asked Steve to report to me on how we can make the Corporation do better and to get help where it's most needed. And secondly, Professor John DiIulio will head the new office I am announcing today. He is one of the most influential social entrepreneurs in America. I can't tell you how honored I am for him to leave his post in academia to join us. He is the author of a respected textbook on American Government. He has a servant's heart on the issues that we will confront. He's worked with disadvantaged children. He has been a major force in mobilizing the city of Philadelphia to support faith-based and community groups. It's a fantastic team. I'm honored to have them on my team. I look forward to hearing from them, as well as I look forward to working with the people in this room and the social entrepreneurs all across America who've heard the universal call to love a neighbor like they'd like to be loved themselves, to exist and work hard, not out of the love of money but out of the love of their fellow human beings. I'm absolutely convinced the great fabric of the Nation exists in neighborhoods, amongst unsung heroes who do heroic acts on a daily and hourly basis. It's the fabric of the country that makes America unique. It is the power of promise that makes the future so promising—is the power of the missions that stand behind me. This is an effort that will be an effort from now, the second week of my administration, to the last week of my administration, because I am confident that this initiative, when fully implemented, will help us realize the dream that America—its hopes, its promise, its greatness will extend its reach throughout every single neighborhood all across the land. And now it is my honor to sign the two Executive orders.",remarks-signing-executive-orders-with-respect-faith-based-and-community-initiatives.txt,44,good morning thank you all for coming i take great

"Thank you all. Thank you very much for that warm welcome. I'm pleased to be back in New York City. New York City is a unique symbol of America's creativity and character and resilience. In the last 10 months, New Yorkers have shown a watching world the true spirit of your city, a spirit that honors the loss, remembers its heroes, and goes forward with determination and with confidence. The people of this city are writing one of the greatest chapters in our Nation's history, and all Americans are proud of New York. I've come to the financial capital of the world to speak of a serious challenge to our financial markets and to the confidence on which they rest. The misdeeds now being uncovered in some quarters of corporate America are threatening the financial well-being of many workers and many investors. At this moment, America's greatest economic need is higher ethical standards, standards enforced by strict laws and upheld by responsible business leaders. The lure of heady profits of the late 1990s spawned abuses and excesses. With strict enforcement and higher ethical standards, we must usher in a new era of integrity in corporate America. I want to thank Bill for his introduction. There's nothing like being recycled.  But thanks for having me, and I'm honored to meet your family and Uncle Jack.  I appreciate very much Secretary O'Neill and Secretary Evans traveling with me today. I want to thank the members of the New York delegation, Senators Schumer and Clinton as well as Congressman Fossella and Congressman Rangel. I appreciate so very much the mayor—my friend the mayor for being here to greet me as I came in on the chopper. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thanks for the great job you're doing for New York. I'm honored that Cardinal Egan is here. And I appreciate so very much seeing John Whitehead, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. And thank you all for coming as well. The American economy, our economy, is built on confidence—the conviction that our free enterprise system will continue to be the most powerful and most promising in the world. That confidence is well-placed. After all, American technology is the most advanced in the world. Our universities attract the talent of the world. Our workers and ranchers and farmers can compete with anybody in the world. Our society rewards hard work and honest ambition, bringing people to our shores from all around the world who share those values. The American economy is the most creative and enterprising and productive system ever devised. We can be confident because America is taking every necessary step to fight and win the war on terror. We are reorganizing the Federal Government to protect the homeland. We are hunting down the terrorists who seek to sow chaos. My commitment and the commitment of our Government is total. We will not relent until the coldblooded killers are found, disrupted, and defeated. We can be confident because of the amazing achievements of American workers and entrepreneurs. In spite of all that happened last year, from the economic slowdown to the terrorist attack, worker productivity has grown by 4.2 percent over the last four quarters. In the first quarter of 2002, the economy grew at an annual rate exceeding 6 percent. Though there's much work left to do, American workers have defied the pessimists and laid the foundation for a sustained recovery. We can be confident because we're pursuing pro-growth reforms in Washington, DC. Last year we passed the biggest tax cut in a generation, which encouraged job creation and boosted consumer spending at just the right time. For the sake of long-term growth, I'm asking Congress to make the tax reductions permanent. I'm asking Congress to join me to promote free trade, which will open new markets and create better jobs and spur innovation. I ask Congress to work with me to pass a terrorism insurance bill, to give companies the security they need to expand and to build. And I will insist on—and if need be, enforce— discipline in Federal spending, so we can meet our national priorities without undermining our economy. We have much to be confident about in America. Yet our economy and our country need one more kind of confidence, confidence in the character and conduct of all of our business leaders. The American economy today is rising, while faith in the fundamental integrity of American business leaders is being undermined. Nearly every week brings better economic news and a discovery of fraud and scandal, problems long in the making but now coming to light. We've learned of some business leaders obstructing justice and misleading clients, falsifying records, business executives breaching the trust and abusing power. We've learned of CEOs earning tens of millions of dollars in bonuses just before their companies go bankrupt, leaving employees and retirees and investors to suffer. The business pages of American newspapers should not read like a scandal sheet. The vast majority of business men and women are honest. They do right by their employees and their shareholders. They do not cut ethical corners, and their work helps create an economy which is the envy of the world. Yet high-profile acts of deception have shaken people's trust. Too many corporations seem disconnected from the values of our country. These scandals have hurt the reputations of many good and honest companies. They have hurt the stock market. And worst of all, they are hurting millions of people who depend on the integrity of businesses for their livelihood and their retirement, for their peace of mind and their financial well-being. When abuses like this begin to surface in the corporate world, it is time to reaffirm the basic principles and rules that make capitalism work, truthful books and honest people and well-enforced laws against fraud and corruption. All investment is an act of faith, and faith is earned by integrity. In the long run, there's no capitalism without conscience; there is no wealth without character. And so again today I'm calling for a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business community, an ethic that will increase investor confidence, will make employees proud of their companies, and again regain the trust of the American people. Our Nation's most respected business leaders, including many gathered here today, take this ethic very seriously. The Business Roundtable, the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ have all proposed guidelines to improve corporate conduct and transparency. These include requirements that independent directors compose the majority of the company's board, that all members of audit, nominating, and compensation committees be independent, and that all stock option plans be approved by the shareholders. I call on all the stock markets to adopt these sensible reforms, these commonsense reforms, as soon as possible. Self-regulation is important, but it's not enough. Government cannot remove risk from investment—I know that—or chance from the market. But Government can do more to promote transparency and ensure that risks are honest, and Government can ensure that those who breach the trust of the American people are punished. Bold, well-considered reforms should demand integrity without stifling innovation and economic growth. From the antitrust laws of the 19th century to the S&L reforms of recent times, America has tackled financial problems when they appeared. The actions I'm proposing follow in this tradition and should be welcomed by every honest company in America. First, we will use the full weight of the law to expose and root out corruption. My administration will do everything in our power to end the days of cooking the books, shading the truth, and breaking our laws. Today, by Executive order, I create a new Corporate Fraud Task Force, headed by the Deputy Attorney General, which will target major accounting fraud and other criminal activity in corporate finance. The task force will function as a financial crimes SWAT team, overseeing the investigation of corporate abusers and bringing them to account. I'm also proposing tough new criminal penalties for corporate fraud. This legislation would double the maximum prison terms for those convicted of financial fraud from 5 to 10 years. Defrauding investors is a serious offense, and the punishment must be as serious as the crime. I ask Congress to strengthen the ability of SEC investigators to temporarily freeze improper payments to corporate executives and to strengthen laws that prevent the destruction of corporate documents in order to hide crimes. Second, we're moving corporate accounting out of the shadows, so the investing public will have a true and fair and timely picture of assets and liabilities and income of publicly traded companies. Greater transparency will expose bad companies and, just as importantly, protect the reputations of the good ones. To expose corporate corruption, I asked Congress 4 months ago for funding to place 100 new enforcement personnel in the SEC. And I call on Congress to act quickly on this request. Today I announce my administration is asking Congress for an additional $100 million in the coming year to give the SEC the officers and the technology it needs to enforce the law. If more scandals are hiding in corporate America, we must find and expose them now, so we can begin rebuilding the confidence of our people and the momentum of our markets. I've also proposed a 10-point accountability plan for American business, designed to provide better information to shareholders, set clear responsibility for corporate officers, and develop a stronger, more independent auditing system. This plan is ensuring that the SEC takes aggressive and affirmative action. Corporate officers who benefit from false accounting statements should forfeit all money gained by their fraud. An executive whose compensation is tied to his company's performance makes more money when his company does well. That's fine, and that's fair when the accounting is aboveboard. Yet when a company uses deception, deception accounting to hide reality, executives should lose all their compensation—all their compensation gained by the deceit. Corporate leaders who violate the public trust should never be given that trust again. The SEC should be able to punish corporate leaders who are convicted of abusing their powers by banning them from ever serving again as officers or directors of a publicly held corporation. If an executive is guilty of outright fraud, resignation is not enough. Only a ban on serving at the top of another company will protect other shareholders and employees. My accountability plan also requires CEOs to personally vouch for their firms' annual financial statements. Currently, a CEO signs a nominal certificate and does so merely on behalf of the company. In the future, the signature of the CEO should also be his or her personal certification of the veracity and fairness of the financial disclosures. When you sign a statement, you're pledging your word, and you should stand behind it. And because the shareholders of America need confidence in financial disclosures right away, the SEC has ordered the leaders of nearly 1,000 large public companies to certify that the financial information they submitted in the last year was fair and it was accurate. I've also called on the SEC to adopt new rules to ensure that auditors will be independent and not compromised by conflicts of interest. The House of Representatives has passed needed legislation to encourage transparency and accountability in American businesses. The Senate also needs to act quickly and responsibly, so I can sign a good bill into law. Third, my administration will guard the interests of small investor and pension holders. More than 80 million Americans own stock, and many of them are new to the market. Buying stock gives them an opportunity to build wealth over the long term, and this is the very kind of responsible investment we must promote in America. To encourage stock ownership, we must make sure that analysts give honest advice and pension plans treat workers fairly. Stock analysts should be trusted advisers, not salesmen with a hidden agenda. We must prevent analysts from touting weak companies because they happen to be clients of their own firm for underwriting or merger advice. This is a flat-out conflict of interest, and we'll aggressively enforce new SEC rules against this practice, rules which take effect today. And the stock markets should make sure that the advice analysts give and the terms they use have real meaning to investors. ""Buy"" should not be the only word in an analyst's vocabulary, and they should never say ""hold"" when they really mean ""sell."" Small investors should also not have to have the deck stacked against them when it comes to managing their own retirement funds. My pension reform proposal would treat corporate executives the same as workers during so-called blackout periods, when employees are prohibited from trading in their own accounts. What's fair for the workers is fair for the bosses. My reform proposal gives workers quarterly information about their investments. It expands workers' access to sound investment advice and allows them to diversify out of company stock. The House has passed these measures. I urge the Senate to do the same. Tougher laws and stricter requirements will help; it'll help. Yet ultimately, the ethics of American business depend on the conscience of America's business leaders. We need men and women of character, who know the difference between ambition and destructive greed, between justified risk and irresponsibility, between enterprise and fraud. Our schools of business must be principled teachers of right and wrong and not surrender to moral confusion and relativism. Our leaders of business must set high and clear expectations of conduct, demonstrated by their own conduct. Responsible business leaders do not jump ship during hard times. Responsible leaders do not collect huge bonus packages when the value of their company dramatically declines. Responsible leaders do not take home tens of millions of dollars in compensation as their companies prepare to file for bankruptcy, devastating the holdings of their investors. Everyone in a company should live up to high standards, but the burden of leadership rightly belongs to the chief executive officer. CEOs set the ethical direction for their companies. They set a moral tone by the decisions they make, the respect they show their employees, and their willingness to be held accountable for their actions. They set a moral tone by showing their disapproval of other executives who bring discredit to the business world. And one of the principal ways that CEOs set an ethical tone is through their compensation. The pay package sends a clear signal whether a business leader is committed to teamwork or personal enrichment. It tells you whether his principal goal is the creation of wealth for shareholders or the accumulation of wealth for himself. The SEC currently requires the annual disclosure of the CEO's compensation. But that information is often buried in long proxy statement—proxy statements—and seldom seen, seldom seen by shareholders. I challenge every CEO in America to describe in the company's annual report, prominently and in plain English, details of his or her compensation package, including salary and bonus and benefits. And the CEO, in that report, should also explain why his or her compensation package is in the best interest of the company he serves. Those who sit on corporate boards have responsibilities. I urge board members to check the quality of their company's financial statements, to ask tough questions about accounting methods, to demand that audit firms are not beholden to the CEO, and to make sure the compensation for senior executives squares with reality and common sense. And I challenge compensation committees to put an end to all company loans to corporate officers. Shareholders also need to make their voices heard. They should demand an attentive and active board of directors. They should demand truly independent directors. They should demand that compensation committees reward long-term success, not failure. Shareholders should demand
 accountability not just in bad times but especially in boom times, when accountability frequently breaks down. Shareholders are a company's most important constituency, and they should act like it. The 1990s was a decade of tremendous economic growth. As we're now learning, it was also a decade when the promise of rapid profits allowed the seeds of scandal to spring up. A lot of money was made, but too often standards were tossed aside. Yet the American system of enterprise has not failed us. Some dishonest individuals have failed our system. Now comes the urgent work of enforcement and reform, driven by a new ethic of responsibility. We will show that markets can be both dynamic and honest, that lasting wealth and prosperity are built on a foundation of integrity. By reasserting the best values of our country, we will reclaim the promise of our economy. Leaders in this room help give the free enterprise system an ethical compass, and the Nation respects you for that. We need that influence now more than ever. I want to thank you for helping to restore the people's trust in American business. I want to thank you for your love of the country. And I want to thank you for giving me the chance to come and address you today. May God bless you all.

capital of the world to speak of a serious challenge to our financial markets and to the confidence on which they rest the misdeeds now being uncovered in some quarters of corporate america are threatening the financial well being of many workers and many investors at this moment america's greatest economic need is higher ethical standards standards enforced by strict laws and upheld by responsible business leaders the lure of heady profits of the late 1990s spawned abuses and excesses with strict enforcement and higher ethical standards we must usher in a new era of integrity in corporate america i want to thank bill for his introduction there's nothing like being recycled but thanks for having me and i'm honored to meet your family and uncle jack i appreciate very much secretary o'neill and secretary evans traveling with me today i want to thank the members of the new york delegation senators schumer and clinton as well as congressman fossella and congressman rangel i appreciate so very much the mayor'my friend the mayor for being here to greet me as i came in on the chopper thank you mr mayor and thanks for the great job you're doing for new york i'm honored that cardinal egan is here and i appreciate so very much seeing john whitehead the chairman of the lower manhattan development corporation and thank you all for coming as well the american economy our economy is built on confidence'the conviction that our free enterprise system will continue to be the most powerful and most promising in the world that confidence is well placed after all american technology is the most advanced in the world our universities attract the talent of the world our workers and ranchers and farmers can compete with anybody in the world our society rewards hard work and honest ambition bringing people to our shores from all around the world who share those values the american economy is the most creative and enterprising and productive system ever devised we can be confident because america is taking every necessary step to fight and win the war on terror we are reorganizing the federal government to protect the homeland we are hunting down the terrorists who seek to sow chaos my commitment and the commitment of our government is total we will not relent until the coldblooded killers are found disrupted and defeated we can be confident because of the amazing achievements of american workers and entrepreneurs in spite of all that happened last year from the economic slowdown to the terrorist attack worker productivity has grown by 4 2 percent over the last four quarters in the first quarter of 2002 the economy grew at an annual rate exceeding 6 percent though there's much work left to do american workers have defied the pessimists and laid the foundation for a sustained recovery we can be confident because we're pursuing pro growth reforms in washington dc last year we passed the biggest tax cut in a generation which encouraged job creation and boosted consumer spending at just the right time for the sake of long term growth i'm asking congress to make the tax reductions permanent i'm asking congress to join me to promote free trade which will open new markets and create better jobs and spur innovation i ask congress to work with me to pass a terrorism insurance bill to give companies the security they need to expand and to build and i will insist on'and if need be enforce'discipline in federal spending so we can meet our national priorities without undermining our economy we have much to be confident about in america yet our economy and our country need one more kind of confidence confidence in the character and conduct of all of our business leaders the american economy today is rising while faith in the fundamental integrity of american business leaders is being undermined nearly every week brings better economic news and a discovery of fraud and scandal problems long in the making but now coming to light we've learned of some business leaders obstructing justice and misleading clients falsifying records business executives breaching the trust and abusing power we've learned of ceos earning tens of millions of dollars in bonuses just before their companies go bankrupt leaving employees and retirees and investors to suffer the business pages of american newspapers should not read like a scandal sheet the vast majority of business men and women are honest they do right by their employees and their shareholders they do not cut ethical corners and their work helps create an economy which is the envy of the world yet high profile acts of deception have shaken people's trust too many corporations seem disconnected from the values of our country these scandals have hurt the reputations of many good and honest companies they have hurt the stock market and worst of all they are hurting millions of people who depend on the integrity of businesses for their livelihood and their retirement for their peace of mind and their financial well being when abuses like this begin to surface in the corporate world it is time to reaffirm the basic principles and rules that make capitalism work truthful books and honest people and well enforced laws against fraud and corruption all investment is an act of faith and faith is earned by integrity in the long run there's no capitalism without conscience there is no wealth without character and so again today i'm calling for a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business community an ethic that will increase investor confidence will make employees proud of their companies and again regain the trust of the american people our nation's most respected business leaders including many gathered here today take this ethic very seriously the business roundtable the new york stock exchange the nasdaq have all proposed guidelines to improve corporate conduct and transparency these include requirements that independent directors compose the majority of the company's board that all members of audit nominating and compensation committees be independent and that all stock option plans be approved by the shareholders i call on all the stock markets to adopt these sensible reforms these commonsense reforms as soon as possible self regulation is important but it's not enough government cannot remove risk from investment'i know that'or chance from the market but government can do more to promote transparency and ensure that risks are honest and government can ensure that those who breach the trust of the american people are punished bold well considered reforms should demand integrity without stifling innovation and economic growth from the antitrust laws of the 19th century to the s l reforms of recent times america has tackled financial problems when they appeared the actions i'm proposing follow in this tradition and should be welcomed by every honest company in america first we will use the full weight of the law to expose and root out corruption my administration will do everything in our power to end the days of cooking the books shading the truth and breaking our laws today by executive order i create a new corporate fraud task force headed by the deputy attorney general which will target major accounting fraud and other criminal activity in corporate finance the task force will function as a financial crimes swat team overseeing the investigation of corporate abusers and bringing them to account i'm also proposing tough new criminal penalties for corporate fraud this legislation would double the maximum prison terms for those convicted of financial fraud from 5 to 10 years defrauding investors is a serious offense and the punishment must be as serious as the crime i ask congress to strengthen the ability of sec investigators to temporarily freeze improper payments to corporate executives and to strengthen laws that prevent the destruction of corporate documents in order to hide crimes second we're moving corporate accounting out of the shadows so the investing public will have a true and fair and timely picture of assets and liabilities and income of publicly traded companies greater transparency will expose bad companies and just as importantly protect the reputations of the good ones to expose corporate corruption i asked congress 4 months ago for funding to place 100 new enforcement personnel in the sec and i call on congress to act quickly on this request today i announce my administration is asking congress for an additional 100 million in the coming year to give the sec the officers and the technology it needs to enforce the law if more scandals are hiding in corporate america we must find and expose them now so we can begin rebuilding the confidence of our people and the momentum of our markets i've also proposed a 10 point accountability plan for american business designed to provide better information to shareholders set clear responsibility for corporate officers and develop a stronger more independent auditing system this plan is ensuring that the sec takes aggressive and affirmative action corporate officers who benefit from false accounting statements should forfeit all money gained by their fraud an executive whose compensation is tied to his company's performance makes more money when his company does well that's fine and that's fair when the accounting is aboveboard yet when a company uses deception deception accounting to hide reality executives should lose all their compensation'all their compensation gained by the deceit corporate leaders who violate the public trust should never be given that trust again the sec should be able to punish corporate leaders who are convicted of abusing their powers by banning them from ever serving again as officers or directors of a publicly held corporation if an executive is guilty of outright fraud resignation is not enough only a ban on serving at the top of another company will protect other shareholders and employees my accountability plan also requires ceos to personally vouch for their firms' annual financial statements currently a ceo signs a nominal certificate and does so merely on behalf of the company in the future the signature of the ceo should also be his or her personal certification of the veracity and fairness of the financial disclosures when you sign a statement you're pledging your word and you should stand behind it and because the shareholders of america need confidence in financial disclosures right away the sec has ordered the leaders of nearly 1 000 large public companies to certify that the financial information they submitted in the last year was fair and it was accurate i've also called on the sec to adopt new rules to ensure that auditors will be independent and not compromised by conflicts of interest the house of representatives has passed needed legislation to encourage transparency and accountability in american businesses the senate also needs to act quickly and responsibly so i can sign a good bill into law third my administration will guard the interests of small investor and pension holders more than 80 million americans own stock and many of them are new to the market buying stock gives them an opportunity to build wealth over the long term and this is the very kind of responsible investment we must promote in america to encourage stock ownership we must make sure that analysts give honest advice and pension plans treat workers fairly stock analysts should be trusted advisers not salesmen with a hidden agenda we must prevent analysts from touting weak companies because they happen to be clients of their own firm for underwriting or merger advice this is a flat out conflict of interest and we'll aggressively enforce new sec rules against this practice rules which take effect today and the stock markets should make sure that the advice analysts give and the terms they use have real meaning to investors buy should not be the only word in an analyst's vocabulary and they should never say hold when they really mean sell small investors should also not have to have the deck stacked against them when it comes to managing their own retirement funds my pension reform proposal would treat corporate executives the same as workers during so called blackout periods when employees are prohibited from trading in their own accounts what's fair for the workers is fair for the bosses my reform proposal gives workers quarterly information about their investments it expands workers' access to sound investment advice and allows them to diversify out of company stock the house has passed these measures i urge the senate to do the same tougher laws and stricter requirements will help it'll help yet ultimately the ethics of american business depend on the conscience of america's business leaders we need men and women of character who know the difference between ambition and destructive greed between justified risk and irresponsibility between enterprise and fraud our schools of business must be principled teachers of right and wrong and not surrender to moral confusion and relativism our leaders of business must set high and clear expectations of conduct demonstrated by their own conduct responsible business leaders do not jump ship during hard times responsible leaders do not collect huge bonus packages when the value of their company dramatically declines responsible leaders do not take home tens of millions of dollars in compensation as their companies prepare to file for bankruptcy devastating the holdings of their investors everyone in a company should live up to high standards but the burden of leadership rightly belongs to the chief executive officer ceos set the ethical direction for their companies they set a moral tone by the decisions they make the respect they show their employees and their willingness to be held accountable for their actions they set a moral tone by showing their disapproval of other executives who bring discredit to the business world and one of the principal ways that ceos set an ethical tone is through their compensation the pay package sends a clear signal whether a business leader is committed to teamwork or personal enrichment it tells you whether his principal goal is the creation of wealth for shareholders or the accumulation of wealth for himself the sec currently requires the annual disclosure of the ceo's compensation but that information is often buried in long proxy statement'proxy statements'and seldom seen seldom seen by shareholders i challenge every ceo in america to describe in the company's annual report prominently and in plain english details of his or her compensation package including salary and bonus and benefits and the ceo in that report should also explain why his or her compensation package is in the best interest of the company he serves those who sit on corporate boards have responsibilities i urge board members to check the quality of their company's financial statements to ask tough questions about accounting methods to demand that audit firms are not beholden to the ceo and to make sure the compensation for senior executives squares with reality and common sense and i challenge compensation committees to put an end to all company loans to corporate officers shareholders also need to make their voices heard they should demand an attentive and active board of directors they should demand truly independent directors they should demand that compensation committees reward long term success not failure shareholders should demand accountability not just in bad times but especially in boom times when accountability

welcomed by every honest company in America."", 'First, we will use the full weight of the law to expose and root out corruption.', 'My administration will do everything in our power to end the days of cooking the books, shading the truth, and breaking our laws.', 'Today, by Executive order, I create a new Corporate Fraud Task Force, headed by the Deputy Attorney General, which will target major accounting fraud and other criminal activity in corporate finance.', 'The task force will function as a financial crimes SWAT team, overseeing the investigation of corporate abusers and bringing them to account.', ""I'm also proposing tough new criminal penalties for corporate fraud."", 'This legislation would double the maximum prison terms for those convicted of financial fraud from 5 to 10 years.', 'Defrauding investors is a serious offense, and the punishment must be as serious as the crime.', 'I ask Congress to strengthen the ability of SEC investigators to temporarily freeze improper

so the investing public will have a true and fair and timely picture of assets and liabilities and income of publicly traded companies."", 'Greater transparency will expose bad companies and, just as importantly, protect the reputations of the good ones.', 'To expose corporate corruption, I asked Congress 4 months ago for funding to place 100 new enforcement personnel in the SEC.', 'And I call on Congress to act quickly on this request.', 'Today I announce my administration is asking Congress for an additional $100 million in the coming year to give the SEC the officers and the technology it needs to enforce the law.', 'If more scandals are hiding in corporate America, we must find and expose them now, so we can begin rebuilding the confidence of our people and the momentum of our markets.', ""I've also proposed a 10-point accountability plan for American business, designed to provide better information to shareholders, set clear responsibility for corporate officers, and develop a stronger, more independent auditing system."", 'This plan is ensuring that the SEC takes aggressive and affirmative action.', 'Corporate officers who benefit from false accounting statements should forfeit all money gained by their fraud.', ""An executive whose compensation is tied to his company's performance makes more money when his company does well."", ""That's fine, and that's fair when the accounting is aboveboard."", 'Yet when a company uses deception, deception accounting to hide reality, executives should lose all their compensation—all their compensation gained by the deceit.', 'Corporate leaders who violate the public trust should never be given that trust again.', 'The SEC should be able to punish corporate leaders who are convicted of abusing their powers by banning them from ever serving again as officers or directors of a publicly held corporation.', 'If an executive is guilty of outright fraud, resignation is not enough.', 'Only a ban on serving at the top of another company will protect other shareholders and employees.', ""My accountability plan also requires CEOs to personally vouch for their firms' annual financial statements."", 'Currently, a CEO signs a nominal certificate and does so merely on behalf of the company.', 'In the future, the signature of the CEO should also be his or her personal certification of the veracity and fairness of the financial disclosures.', ""When you sign a statement, you're pledging your word, and you should stand behind it."", 'And because the shareholders of America need confidence in financial disclosures right away, the SEC has ordered the leaders of nearly 1,000 large public companies to certify that the financial information they submitted in the last year was fair and it was accurate.', ""I've also called on the SEC to adopt new rules to ensure that auditors will be independent and not compromised by conflicts of interest."", 'The House of Representatives has passed needed

administration will guard the interests of small investor and pension holders.', 'More than 80 million Americans own stock, and many of them are new to the market.', 'Buying stock gives them an opportunity to build wealth over the long term, and this is the very kind of responsible investment we must promote in America.', 'To encourage stock ownership, we must make sure that analysts give honest advice and pension plans treat workers fairly.', 'Stock analysts should be trusted advisers, not salesmen with a hidden agenda.', 'We must prevent analysts from touting weak companies because they happen to be clients of their own firm for underwriting or merger advice.', ""This is a flat-out conflict of interest, and we'll aggressively enforce new SEC rules against this practice, rules which take effect today."", 'And the stock markets should make sure that the advice analysts give and the terms they use have real meaning to investors.', '""Buy"" should not be the only word in an analyst\'s vocabulary, and they should never say ""hold"" when they really mean ""sell.""', 'Small investors should also not have to have the deck stacked against them when it comes to managing their own retirement funds.', 'My pension reform proposal would treat corporate executives the same as workers during so-called blackout periods, when employees are prohibited from trading in their own accounts.', ""What's fair for the workers is fair for the bosses."", 'My reform proposal gives workers quarterly information about their investments.', ""It expands workers' access to sound investment advice and allows them to diversify out of company stock."", 'The House has passed these measures.', 'I urge the Senate to do the same.', ""Tougher laws and stricter requirements will help; it'll help."", ""Yet ultimately, the ethics of American business depend on the conscience of America's business leaders."", 'We need men and women of character, who know the difference between ambition and destructive greed, between justified risk and irresponsibility, between enterprise and fraud.', 'Our schools of business must be principled teachers of right and wrong and not surrender to moral confusion and relativism.', 'Our leaders of business must set high and clear expectations of conduct, demonstrated by their own conduct.', 'Responsible business leaders do not jump ship during hard times.', 'Responsible leaders do not collect huge bonus packages when the value of their company dramatically declines.', 'Responsible leaders do not take home tens of millions of dollars in compensation as their companies prepare to file for bankruptcy, devastating the holdings of their investors.', 'Everyone in a company should live up to high standards, but the burden of leadership rightly belongs to the chief executive officer.', 'CEOs set the ethical direction for their companies.', 'They set a moral tone by the decisions they make, the respect they show their employees, and their willingness to be held accountable for their actions.', 'They set a moral tone by showing their disapproval of other executives who bring discredit to the business world.', 'And one of the principal ways that CEOs set an ethical tone is through their compensation.', 'The pay package sends a clear signal whether a business leader is committed to teamwork or personal enrichment.', 'It tells you whether his principal goal is the creation of wealth for shareholders or the accumulation of wealth for himself.', ""The SEC currently requires the annual disclosure of the CEO's compensation."", 'But that information is often buried in long proxy statement—proxy statements—and seldom seen, seldom seen by shareholders.', ""I challenge every CEO in America to describe in the company's annual report, prominently and in plain English, details of his or her compensation package, including salary and bonus and benefits."", 'And the CEO, in that report, should also explain why his or her compensation package is in the best interest of the company he serves.', 'Those who sit on corporate boards have responsibilities.', ""I urge board members to check the quality of their company's financial statements, to ask tough questions about accounting methods, to demand that audit firms are not beholden to the CEO, and to make sure the compensation for senior executives squares with reality and common sense."", 'And I challenge compensation committees to put an end to all company loans to corporate officers.', 'Shareholders also need to make their voices heard.', 'They should demand an attentive and active board of directors.', 'They should demand truly independent directors.', 'They should demand that compensation committees reward long-term success, not failure.', 'Shareholders should demand accountability not just in bad times but especially in boom times, when accountability frequently breaks down.', ""Shareholders are a company's most important constituency, and they should act like it."", 'The 1990s was a decade of tremendous economic growth.', ""As we're now learning, it was also a decade when the promise of rapid profits allowed the seeds of scandal to spring up."", 'A lot of money was made, but too often standards were tossed aside.', 'Yet the American system of enterprise has not failed us.', 'Some dishonest individuals have failed our system.', 'Now comes the urgent work of enforcement and reform, driven by a new ethic of responsibility.', 'We will show that markets can be both dynamic and honest, that lasting wealth and prosperity are built on a foundation of integrity.', 'By reasserting the best values of our country, we will reclaim the promise of our economy.', 'Leaders in this room help give the free enterprise system an ethical compass, and the Nation respects you for that.', 'We need that influence now more than ever.', ""I want to thank you for helping to restore the people's trust in American business."", 'I want to thank

In once sentence we affirm our form of government, our belief in human dignity, our unity as a people, and our reliance on Providence.

And this pledge takes on a special meaning in a time of war. Our enemies hate these words. That's what you've got to understand. They hate the words, and they want to erase them. We're determined to stand for these words, and live them out in our lives. Our allegiance has never been stronger. We've never been more determined. And we must work to teach our children to love our nation as much as we do.

I want to thank you all for coming today. I particularly want to thank our Secretary of Education for traveling with me -- Rod Paige. I picked Rod out of a lot of really good candidates because I wanted somebody to be in Washington who had actually been on the front lines of educating every child. We didn't need any more theory in Washington. We needed people that actually done. And when we talk about raising the bar and challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, so that every child can learn, when we talk about having an accountability system to make sure no child is left behind, our Secretary of Education has actually done it. He ran one of the largest school districts in my state, our state, and he did so with class and dignity. And the children of Houston, Texas are better off for it.

Mr. Secretary, thank you for coming. I'm also proud to be sharing the stage with another superintendent -- Pedro Garcia. Mucho gusto, Pedro. 

Pedro is a good leader. It's very interesting -- we were talking before we came out here and Pedro was a part of what they call Operation Pedro Pan -- Operation Peter Pan. So, by the way, was a member of my Cabinet, Mel Martinez. When both Pedro and Mel were young men, their parents wanted their children to grow up in freedom. So they put them on an airplane to a foreign land. They had great faith in America, faith -- so much faith in the ideals of our country that they were willing to trust their teenage children with a stranger in a foreign country. And they came and were loved. I don't know, Pedro, whether your mom and dad came, but Mel's mother and daddy came.

And I want you all to remember these stories about Pedro, who's now your Superintendent of School, or Mel, who's in my Cabinet, that this country offered so much hope and so much promise, because we believe so strongly in freedom that people, such as the Garcias and the Martinezes were willing to give up their children so they could grow up in a free society.

I love the story of Pedro Pan. I love the job you're doing, and I wish you all the best. And I'm also so appreciative for Kaye, Kaye Schneider, the principal of East Literature Magnet School, for opening up this school. She said it's been an amazing experience. I bet it has, with all these all these advance people and all the entourage here. But thanks for opening up this great school. I'm here because this is a center of excellence, a school that refuses to leave any child behind, and it starts with having a good solid, sound principal. So, Kaye, thank you very much. 

I want to thank all the teachers who are here. Thank you for taking on a noble profession.  Old Sam Houston, he used to live in Tennessee. And at one time he had been the governor of Texas and a senator from Texas. And he was a famous Tennessee guy, and he was President of the Republic of Texas. And they said, of all the jobs you've ever had, Sam, what was the most important one? He said, without hesitation, teacher, because he had been a teacher. 

I want to thank the mothers and dads who are here. Thank you for coming. You, too, are teachers. The best education starts at home, by loving your children with all your heart and all your soul. I want to thank the students who are here. Thanks for letting me come by and visit with you.

I appreciate very much elected officials who have come today: Senator Fred Thompson, Senator Bill Frist, Congressman Zach Wamp, Congressman Van Hilleary, Congressman Bob Clement, Congressman Bart Gordon, Congressman Ed Bryant. I want to thank your Mayor, Bill Purcell, for coming as well, the Mayor of Nashville. Thank my friend, Lamar Alexander, for being here.

But most of all, I want to thank you all for giving me a chance to come and share some thoughts. It is very important for our youngsters to understand history, the history of our country, the ideals that make our country strong. This morning at the Rose Garden I kicked off a national initiative, and I'm going to describe some of what we're going to do to make sure that we teach more history to our children.

Especially important in a time of war that our children understand the context of why we fight. You see, ours is a history of freedom. One of the most precious ideas we have is freedom for everybody. We love our freedoms. We love the idea of being a free society. And throughout our history, people have fought for freedom. Whether it's been in the Revolutionary War, or the heroic struggle to end slavery, or civil rights wars in the United States Congress, or whether it's World War II where we fought to free people from tyranny, the history of this nation has been a history of freedom and justice.

Our children are growing up in a difficult time for America, because they see on their TV screens the fact that America is now a battlefield. When we were kids, a lot of us were kids, growing up, oceans separated us from danger. We were confident in our ability to resist evil because evil could never make it to our shore, unless it was created internally. But now we've entered a new period where we're vulnerable. It's tough for our children to comprehend that, I know.

But you've got to understand why we're vulnerable, and that is because there are people in the world that hate the fact that we love freedom. People cannot stand the fact that your great nation not only allows, but encourages people to worship an almighty God in any way they want to. We welcome that in America. 

We speak our mind freely. All you've got to do is remember it's an election year.  We believe in a free press. And we're not going to change. We love our freedoms. Our history has taught us that. And today, we love them just as strongly as others in the past have.

The other thing the children are learning is the notion of people serving something greater than themselves in life. You know, I think one of the most defining moments of the recent American history was Flight 93. Flight 93 is an amazing lesson. Laura and I had the honor of going to the site there in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the other day to hug and cry and visit with and smile with if they wanted to smile, with the family members of those brave souls who were on that airplane.

But it's a lesson of people loving freedom so much and loving their country so much, that they're willing to drive a plane into the ground to save other people's lives. What a powerful message, that part of being an American is to serve something greater than yourself. Part of being a citizen in this great land is to not only take from the land, but to give.

So today, when you realize there are military people looking in caves in Afghanistan, or moving around the world to try to fight tyranny and terrorism, they do so to serve something greater than themselves -- because of a strong ideal, a strong sense of purpose, a strong sense of country.

You've got to understand there are some in this world that simply do not adhere to the ideals we believe in. In Iraq, they don't put their hand over their heart and say, ""Liberty and justice for all."" They don't believe in liberty. The dictator who runs Iraq doesn't believe in justice. He only believes in liberty and justice for those who he decides get liberty and justice.

There's a lot of talk about Iraq on our TV screens, and there should be, because we're trying to figure out how best to make the world a peaceful place. There's an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee -- that says, fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again. You've got to understand the nature of the regime we're dealing with. This is a man who has delayed, denied, deceived the world. For the sake of liberty and justice for all, the United Nations Security Council must act, must act in way to hold this regime to account, must not be fooled, must be relevant to keep the peace.

Part of the American history teaches us that we must lead toward a more peaceful world. Part of the history of the world shows that as threats develop, we must deal with them before they become too acute, unmanageable. Part of our history is, is that we're a peaceful people. We love and long for peace, that we want peace for generations to come. But sometimes we must act in order to achieve the peace.

And all our history says we believe in liberty and justice for all, that when we see oppression, we cry; that when we found out that young girls in Afghanistan could not go to school because they were in the clutches of one of the most barbaric regimes in the history of mankind, we acted not only to uphold doctrine and to fight the war against terror, we acted to liberate people. Our history shows that we're not a nation which conquers; we're a nation which liberates.

History is important for our children to understand, to give them a better sense of how to understand what we do and a sense of what it means to be an American; a sense of importance of serving something greater than yourself in life.

The first initiative that we're going to put out is called We the People, which will encourage American history and civic education all around the country. There will be a grant program to encourage the development of good curricula and a lecture series, and essays by high school students on liberty and justice and freedom.

We've got a great store of documents here in America, and so we're going to put out a program called Our Documents, the National Archivist is going to work with us to make sure all of the archives of America are now on-line, so schools can easily tap in to find out how our history developed through the archives of the country. It ought to be a really interesting way for our students to learn more about America.

We're going to have a White House forum there in Washington, D.C. -- obviously; that's where the White House is -- in January or February of next year, to call in experts as to how better teach our history, and at the same time, teach the ideals that make us a great nation. We're going to do our part at the federal level; it's very important that you all do your part here in Nashville, Tennessee, and insist upon good civics lessons, the true lessons of history, to make sure our children understand the ideals that make us great.

And one of the things our youngsters and those of us not quite so young can do -- and this is important -- is to celebrate patriotism by loving your neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself. You see, it's important to realize that one person can't do everything to change America, but one person can do something. Every child who hurts, who receives your love, is part of changing America for the better, is part of fighting evil with acts of kindness and decency.

I met Harry Ingle, Jr., at Air Force One. He's an East Literature Magnet student. He's a junior. He was out there because he is involved with mentoring children. He's a soldier in the army of compassion here in Nashville, Tennessee. He's a part of the true strength of America, which is neighbor loving neighbor. Those of us who are on our feet, helping those who aren't on their feet. He's a part of the light that can help shine into corners of darkness, where there may be despair and addiction and loneliness.

No, part of patriotism is not just to put a hand over our heart, but part of being a patriot is to serve the ideals of this country by serving something greater than yourself.

I want the students here to understand that this great nation of ours longs for peace, but we also want to practice compassion. And you can be a part of the compassionate future by helping somebody in need.

It is an honor to be here at this fine school, in this fine city, in this great state, to celebrate with millions of students all across the country the Pledge of Allegiance, the Pledge across America. It is my honor to be here to remind people the great ideals of the greatest country on the face of the Earth.

May God bless you all and may God bless America.

"Over the past several months, I've held a series of meetings with my economic team on the outlook of—for the U.S. economy. And before I left for the Middle East, I directed them to conduct a thorough assessment of our economic condition, consult with Members of Congress, and provide me with their recommendations about any actions we might need to take. The economic team reports that our economy has a solid foundation, but that there are areas of real concern. Our economy is still creating jobs, though at a reduced pace. Consumer spending is still growing, but the housing market is declining. Business investment and exports are still rising, but the cost of imported oil has increased. My administration has been watching our economy carefully. My advisers and many outside experts expect that our economy will continue to grow over the coming year, but at a slower rate than we have enjoyed for the past few years. And there is a risk of a downturn. Continued instability in the housing and financial markets could cause additional harm to our overall economy and put our growth and job creation in jeopardy. In recent months, we've taken steps to shore up the housing market, including measures to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and to keep their homes. I've also—have asked Congress to pass legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration and enable it to provide additional assistance to struggling homeowners. The House passed a bill, and the Senate passed a bill, and now they need to get together and get a bill to my desk as quickly as possible. After careful consideration and after discussions with Members of the Congress, I have concluded that additional action is needed. To keep our economy growing and creating jobs, Congress and the administration need to work to enact an economic growth package as soon as possible. As Congress considers such a plan, there are certain principles that must guide its deliberations. This growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours, which means it should be about 1 percent of GDP. This growth package must be built on broad-based tax relief that will directly affect economic growth and not the kind of spending projects that would have little immediate impact on our economy. This growth package must be temporary and take effect right away so we can get help to our economy when it needs it most. And this growth package must not include any tax increases. Specifically, this growth package should bolster both business investment and consumer spending, which are critical to economic growth. And this would require two key provisions. To be effective, a growth package must include tax incentive for American businesses, including small businesses, to make major investments in their enterprises this year. Giving them an incentive to invest now will encourage businessowners to expand their operations, create new jobs, and inject new energy into our economy in the process. To be effective, a growth package must also include direct and rapid income tax relief for the American people. Americans could use this money as they see fit: to help meet their monthly bills, cover higher costs at the gas pump, or pay for other basic necessities. Letting Americans keep more of their own money should increase consumer spending and lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less. Yesterday I spoke to members of the congressional leadership from both political parties. They shared with me their thoughts on the best way forward, and I was encouraged by those discussions. And I believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support. I've asked Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to lead my administration's efforts to forge an agreement with Congress so that we can deliver this needed boost to our economy as quickly as possible. Passing a new growth package is our most pressing economic priority. When that is done, Congress must turn to the most important economic priority for our country, and that's making sure the tax relief that is now in place is not taken away. A source of uncertainty in our economy is that this tax relief is set to expire at the end of 2010. Unless Congress acts, the American people will face massive tax increases in less than 3 years. The marriage penalty will make a comeback, the child tax credit will be cut in half, the death tax will come back to life, and tax rates will go up on regular income, capital gains, and dividends. This tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk, and Congress has a responsibility to keep that from happening. So it's critical that Congress make this tax relief permanent. We're in the midst of a challenging period, and I know that Americans are concerned about their economic future. But our economy has seen challenging times before, and it is resilient. In a vibrant economy, markets rise and decline. We cannot change that fundamental dynamic. As a matter of fact, eliminating risk altogether would also eliminate the innovation and productivity that drives the creations of jobs and wealth in America. Yet there are also times when swift and temporary actions can help ensure that inevitable market adjustments do not undermine the health of the broader economy. This is such a moment. By passing an effective growth package quickly, we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy. And it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of our economy. I'm optimistic about our economic future because Americans have shown time and again that they are the most industrious, creative, and enterprising people in the world. That is what has made our economy strong, and that is what will make it stronger in the challenging times ahead.

with Members of Congress, and provide me with their recommendations about any actions we might need to take.', 'The economic team reports that our economy has a solid foundation, but that there are areas of real concern.', 'Our economy is still creating jobs, though at a reduced pace.', 'Consumer spending is still growing, but the housing market is declining.', 'Business investment and exports are still rising, but the cost of imported oil has increased.', 'My administration has been watching our economy carefully.', 'My advisers and many outside experts expect that our economy will continue to grow over the coming year, but at a slower rate than we have enjoyed for the past few years.', 'And there is a risk of a downturn.', 'Continued instability in the housing and financial markets could cause additional harm to our overall economy and put our growth and job creation in jeopardy.', ""In recent months, we've taken steps to shore up the housing market, including measures to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and to keep their homes."", ""I've also—have asked Congress to pass legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration and enable it to provide additional assistance to struggling homeowners."", 'The House passed a bill, and the Senate passed a bill, and now they need to get together and get a bill to my desk as quickly as possible.', 'After careful consideration and after discussions with Members of the Congress, I have concluded that additional action is needed.', 'To keep our economy growing and creating jobs, Congress and the administration need to work to enact an economic growth package as soon as possible.', 'As Congress considers such a plan, there are certain principles that must guide its deliberations.', 'This growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours, which means it should be about 1 percent of GDP.', 'This growth package must be built on broad-based tax relief that will directly affect economic growth and not the kind of spending projects that would have little immediate impact on our economy.', 'This growth package must be temporary and take effect right away so we can get help to our economy when it needs it most.', 'And this growth package must not include any tax increases.', 'Specifically, this growth package should bolster both business investment and consumer spending, which are critical to economic growth.', 'And this would require two key provisions.', 'To be effective, a growth package must include tax incentive for American businesses, including small businesses, to make major investments in their enterprises this year.', 'Giving them an incentive to invest now will encourage businessowners to expand their operations, create new jobs, and inject new energy into our economy in the process.', 'To be effective, a growth package must also include direct and rapid income tax relief for the American people.', 'Americans could use this money as they see fit: to help meet their monthly bills, cover higher costs at the gas pump, or pay for other basic necessities.', 'Letting Americans keep more of their own money should increase consumer spending and lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less.', 'Yesterday I spoke to members of the congressional leadership from both political parties.', 'They shared with me their thoughts on the best way forward, and I was encouraged by those discussions.', 'And I believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support.', ""I've asked Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to lead my administration's efforts to forge an agreement with Congress so that we can deliver this needed boost to our economy as quickly as possible."", 'Passing a new growth package is our most pressing economic priority.', ""When that is done, Congress must turn to the most important economic priority for our country, and that's making sure the tax relief that is now in place is not taken away."", 'A source of uncertainty in our economy is that this tax relief is set to expire at the end of 2010.', 'Unless Congress acts, the American people will face massive tax increases in less than 3 years.', 'The marriage penalty will make a comeback, the child tax credit will be cut in half, the death tax will come back to life, and tax rates will go up on regular income, capital gains, and dividends.', 'This tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk, and Congress has a responsibility to keep that from happening.', ""So it's critical that Congress make this tax relief permanent."", ""We're in the midst of a challenging period, and I know that Americans are concerned about their economic future."", 'But our economy has seen challenging times before, and it is resilient.', 'In a vibrant economy, markets rise and decline.', 'We cannot change that fundamental dynamic.', 'As a matter of fact, eliminating risk altogether would also eliminate the innovation and productivity that drives the creations of jobs and wealth in America.', 'Yet there are also times when swift and temporary actions can help ensure that inevitable market adjustments do not undermine the health of the broader economy.', 'This is such a moment.', 'By passing an effective growth package quickly, we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy.', 'And it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of our economy.', ""I'm optimistic about our economic future because Americans have shown time and again that they are the most industrious, creative, and enterprising people in

"Thank you very much. And tonight I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first President to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker. In his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., from Baltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum. But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Congratulations, Madam Speaker. Two Members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood. Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: The rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour when decisions are hard and courage is needed. We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway and others that are ours to begin. In all of this, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies and the wisdom to face them together. Some in this Chamber are new to the House and the Senate, and I congratulate the Democrat majority. Congress has changed, but not our responsibilities. Each of us is guided by our own convictions, and to these we must stay faithful. Yet we're all held to the same standards and called to serve the same good purposes: to extend this Nation's prosperity, to spend the people's money wisely, to solve problems, not leave them to future generations, to guard America against all evil, and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us. We're not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air. Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and we can achieve big things for the American people. Our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on, as long as we're willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans and to help them build a future of hope and opportunity, and this is the business before us tonight. A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy, and that is what we have. We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs so far. Unemployment is low; inflation is low; wages are rising. This economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government but with more enterprise. Next week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy. Tonight I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress. First, we must balance the Federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need is spending discipline in Washington, DC. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 and met that goal 3 years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the Federal deficit within the next 5 years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the Federal Government, and we can balance the Federal budget. Next, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour, when not even C-SPAN is watching.  In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of the earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate. They are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. You didn't vote them into law, I didn't sign them into law, yet they're treated as if they have the force of law. The time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session. And finally, to keep this economy strong, we must take on the challenge of entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. Yet we're failing in that duty. And this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this Chamber knows this to be true, yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. With enough good sense and good will, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid and save Social Security. Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life. Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding schools accountable for results. And because we acted, students are performing better in reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap. Now the task is to build on the success without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform. We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. We must increase funds for students who struggle and make sure these children get the special help they need. And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills. The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's children, and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law. A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care. When it comes to health care, Government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children, and we will meet those responsibilities. For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy, and so tonight I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax—or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills. At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job. For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings, $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic, private health insurance plan within their reach. Changing the Tax Code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans. My second proposal is to help the States that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured. States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive Federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I have asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing Federal funds and use them to create Affordable Choices grants. These grants would give our Nation's Governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need. There are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand health savings accounts. We need to help small businesses through association health plans. We need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology. We will encourage price transparency. And to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we need to pass medical liability reform. In all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are not made by government and insurance companies but by patients and their doctors. Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of America, with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country. To secure our border, we're doubling the size of the Border Patrol and funding new infrastructure and technology. Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border, and that requires a temporary-worker program. We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. As a result, they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists. We'll enforce our immigration laws at the worksite and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there's no excuse left for violating the law. We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty. Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass and I can sign comprehensive immigration reform into law. Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean. For too long, our Nation has been dependent on foreign oil. And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments and raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy. It's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply. The way forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way America generates electric power by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol, using everything from wood chips to grasses to agricultural wastes. We made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market. And now even more dramatic advances are within reach. Tonight I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we do that, we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the Middle East. To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017, and that is nearly five times the current target. At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks, and conserve up to 81⁄2 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017. Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it. And so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change. A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice. The lives of our citizens across our Nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our Federal courts. We have a shared obligation to ensure that the Federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings. As President, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the Federal bench, and the United States Senate has a duty as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger. Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. We've had time to take stock of our situation. We've added many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us, unless we stop them. With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. Yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror, we must take the fight to the enemy. From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same. Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know. We stopped an Al Qaida plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States. We uncovered an Al Qaida cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them. Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. And so long as that's the case, America is still a nation at war. In the mind of the terrorists, this war began well before September the 11th and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And these past 5 years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. Al Qaida and its followers are Sunni extremists possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. They preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent. Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrow moderate governments and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: ""We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse."" Usama bin Laden declared: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us."" These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shi'a extremists who are just as hostile to Amer
ica and are also determined to dominate the Middle East. Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like Hizballah, a group second only to Al Qaida in the American lives it has taken. The Shi'a and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. Whatever slogans they chant when they slaughter the innocent, they have the same wicked purposes. They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale. In the sixth year since our Nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangers have ended. They have not. And so it remains the policy of this Government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people. This war is more than a clash of arms; it is a decisive ideological struggle. And the security of our Nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. What every terrorist fears most is human freedom: societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments. Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies, and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy. The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity. And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must. In the last 2 years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East, and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution. They drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic Constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a Government under that Constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget. A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and, in 2006, they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. Hizballah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected Government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and Al Qaida fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In Iraq, Al Qaida and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shi'a Islam, the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shi'a, and it succeeded. Radical Shi'a elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day. This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we're in. Every one of us wishes this war were over and won. Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk. Ladies and gentlemen, on this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our resolve and turn events toward victory. We're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq, a plan that demands more from Iraq's elected Government and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of its people, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror. In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi Government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where Al Qaida terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. We didn't drive Al Qaida out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq. The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their Government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad, and they must do so. They pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party, and they need to follow through and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks: to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to reenter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi Province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secure, and our plan will help the Iraqi Government take back its capital and make good on its commitments. My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options. We discussed every possible approach. In the end, I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success. Many in this Chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far-reaching. If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi Government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle between Shi'a extremists backed by Iran and Sunni extremists aided by Al Qaida and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out across the country, and, in time, the entire region could be drawn into the conflict. For America, this is a nightmare scenario; for the enemy, this is the objective. Chaos is the greatest ally, their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq, and to spare the American people from this danger. This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you've made. We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. And I ask you to support our troops in the field and those on their way. The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others. And that's why it's important to work together so our Nation can see this great effort through. Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation. It's why I've proposed to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties. We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us. We'll show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory. And one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next 5 years. A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps. Such a corps would function much like our military reserve. It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them. It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time. Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism. In Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United Nations. We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf States to increase support for Iraq's Government. The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. With the other members of the Quartet—the U.N., the EU, and Russia—we're pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in peace and security. In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning back the Taliban and Al Qaida offensive, the first time the Alliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area. Together with our partners in China and Japan, Russia and South Korea, we're pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. We will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, and Burma, and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur. American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required. We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease, and that is precisely what America is doing. We must continue to fight HIV/ AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa. Because you funded the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving lifesaving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in 3 short years. I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, and I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over 5 years so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries. I ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat. And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty. When America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country. These deeds reflect the character of our people. The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness and courage and self-sacrifice of the American people. You see this spirit often if you know where to look, and tonight we need only look above to the gallery. Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa amid great poverty and disease. He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine, but Coach John Thompson took a look at Dikembe and had a different idea.  Dikembe became a star in the NBA and a citizen of the United States, but he never forgot the land of his birth or the duty to share his blessings with others. He built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of this good-hearted man: ""Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things."" And we are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of the United States of America. After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment and began filming children's videos in her basement. The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just 5 years, her business grew to more than $20 million in sales. In November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to Walt Disney Company, and with her help, Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business. Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America. And she is using her success to help others, producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new project: ""I believe it is the most important thing I have ever done. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe."" And so tonight we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur, Julie Aigner-Clark. Three weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his two little girls when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: ""We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. We have got to show each other some love."" There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like Wesley Autrey. Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire. He used his body as a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm and received shrapnel wounds to his legs, yet he refused medical attention and stayed in the fight. He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's position. For his exceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country. In such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of America. And these qualities are not in short supply. This is a decent and honorable country and resilient too. We've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence, because the State of our Union is strong; our cause in the world is right; and tonight that cause goes on. God bless. See you next year. Thank you for your prayers.
",address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union.txt,6,thank you very much and tonight i have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first president to begin the state of the union message with these words madam speaker in his day the late congressman thomas d'alesandro jr from baltimore maryland saw presidents roosevelt and truman at this rostrum but nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter nancy presiding tonight as speaker of the house of representatives congratulations madam speaker two members of the house and senate are not with us tonight and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of senator tim johnson and congressman charlie norwood madam speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished guests and fellow citizens the rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour when decisions are hard and courage is needed we enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway and others that are ours to begin in all of this much is asked of us we must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies and the wisdom to face them together some in this chamber are new to the house and the senate and i congratulate the democrat majority congress has changed but not our responsibilities each of us is guided by our own convictions and to these we must stay faithful yet we're all held to the same standards and called to serve the same good purposes to extend this nation's prosperity to spend the people's money wisely to solve problems not leave them to future generations to guard america against all evil and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us we're not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air like many before us we can work through our differences and we can achieve big things for the american people our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on as long as we're willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done our job is to make life better for our fellow americans and to help them build a future of hope and opportunity and this is the business before us tonight a future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy and that is what we have we're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth a recovery that has created 7 2 million new jobs so far unemployment is low inflation is low wages are rising this economy is on the move and our job is to keep it that way not with more government but with more enterprise next week i'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy tonight i want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this congress first we must balance the federal budget we can do so without raising taxes what we need is spending discipline in washington dc we set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 and met that goal 3 years ahead of schedule now let us take the next step in the coming weeks i will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next 5 years i ask you to make the same commitment together we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal government and we can balance the federal budget next there is the matter of earmarks these special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour when not even c span is watching in 2005 alone the number of earmarks grew to over 13 000 and totaled nearly 18 billion even worse over 90 percent of the earmarks never make it to the floor of the house and senate they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk you didn't vote them into law i didn't sign them into law yet they're treated as if they have the force of law the time has come to end this practice so let us work together to reform the budget process expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in congress and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session and finally to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements social security and medicare and medicaid are commitments of conscience and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound yet we're failing in that duty and this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options huge tax increases huge deficits or huge and immediate cuts in benefits everyone in this chamber knows this to be true yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act so let us work together and do it now with enough good sense and good will you and i can fix medicare and medicaid and save social security spreading opportunity and hope in america also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life five years ago we rose above partisan differences to pass the no child left behind act preserving local control raising standards and holding schools accountable for results and because we acted students are performing better in reading and math and minority students are closing the achievement gap now the task is to build on the success without watering down standards without taking control from local communities and without backsliding and calling it reform we can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better we must increase funds for students who struggle and make sure these children get the special help they need and we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills the no child left behind act has worked for america's children and i ask congress to reauthorize this good law a future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care when it comes to health care government has an obligation to care for the elderly the disabled and poor children and we will meet those responsibilities for all other americans private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs but many americans cannot afford a health insurance policy and so tonight i propose two new initiatives to help more americans afford their own insurance first i propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax'or payroll taxes on 15 000 of their income single americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on 7 500 of their income with this reform more than 100 million men women and children who are now covered by employer provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills at the same time this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job for americans who now purchase health insurance on their own this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings 4 500 for a family of four making 60 000 a year and for the millions of other americans who have no health insurance at all this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more americans my second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured states that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick i have asked the secretary of health and human services to work with congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create affordable choices grants these grants would give our nation's governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need there are many other ways that congress can help we need to expand health savings accounts we need to help small businesses through association health plans we need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology we will encourage price transparency and to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits we need to pass medical liability reform in all we do we must remember that the best health care decisions are not made by government and insurance companies but by patients and their doctors extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of america with laws that are fair and borders that are secure when laws and borders are routinely violated this harms the interests of our country to secure our border we're doubling the size of the border patrol and funding new infrastructure and technology yet even with all these steps we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border and that requires a temporary worker program we should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis as a result they won't have to try to sneak in and that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists we'll enforce our immigration laws at the worksite and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers so there's no excuse left for violating the law we need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals we need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty convictions run deep in this capitol when it comes to immigration let us have a serious civil and conclusive debate so that you can pass and i can sign comprehensive immigration reform into law extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps america's economy running and america's environment clean for too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil and this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments and raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy it's in our vital interest to diversify america's energy supply the way forward is through technology we must continue changing the way america generates electric power by even greater use of clean coal technology solar and wind energy and clean safe nuclear power we need to press on with battery research for plug in and hybrid vehicles and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel we must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol using everything from wood chips to grasses to agricultural wastes we made a lot of progress thanks to good policies here in washington and the strong response of the market and now even more dramatic advances are within reach tonight i ask congress to join me in pursuing a great goal let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the united states by 20 percent in the next 10 years when we do that we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three quarters of all the oil we now import from the middle east to reach this goal we must increase the supply of alternative fuels by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 and that is nearly five times the current target at the same time we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks and conserve up to 81'2 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017 achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil but it's not going to eliminate it and so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways and to further protect america against severe disruptions to our oil supply i ask congress to double the current capacity of the strategic petroleum reserve america is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil and these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change a future of hope and opportunity requires a fair impartial system of justice the lives of our citizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts we have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings as president i have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench and the united states senate has a duty as well to give those nominees a fair hearing and a prompt up or down vote on the senate floor for all of us in this room there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause we've had time to take stock of our situation we've added many critical protections to guard the homeland we know with certainty that the horrors of that september morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us unless we stop them with the distance of time we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions yet one question has surely been settled that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy from the start america and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense the enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary easy movement steady financing and free flowing communications are long over for the terrorists life since 9 11 has never been the same our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen we cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented but here is some of what we do know we stopped an al qaida plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast we broke up a southeast asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the united states we uncovered an al qaida cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against america and just last august british authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for america over the atlantic ocean for each life saved we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy the evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9 11 is still at work in the world and so long as that's the case america is still a nation at war in the mind of the terrorists this war began well before september the 11th and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled and these past 5 years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy al qaida and its followers are sunni extremists possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology take almost any principle of civilization and their goal is the opposite they preach with threats instruct with bullets and bombs and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions they want to overthrow moderate governments and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country by killing and terrorizing americans they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty they would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology listen to this warning from the late terrorist zarqawi we will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams and what is coming is even worse usama bin laden declared death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us these men are not given to idle words and they are just one camp in the islamist radical movement in recent times it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from shi'a extremists who are just as hostile to america and are also determined to dominate the middle east many are known to take direction from the regime in iran which is funding and arming terrorists like hizballah a group second only to al qaida in the american lives it has taken the shi'a and sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat whatever slogans they chant when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes they want to kill americans kill democracy in the middle east and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale in the sixth year since our nation was attacked i wish i could report to you that the dangers have ended they have not and so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence diplomacy law enforcement and military action to do our duty to find these enemies and to protect the american people this war is more than a clash of arms it is a decisive ideological struggle and the security of our nation is in the balance to prevail we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us what every terrorist fears most is human freedom societies where men and women make their own choices answer to their own conscience and live by their hopes instead of their resentments free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance so we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy the great question of our day is whether america will help men and women in the middle east to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity and i say for the sake of our own security we must in the last 2 years we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader middle east and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction in 2005 the world watched as the citizens of lebanon raised the banner of the cedar revolution they drove out the syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections in 2005 the people of afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature and in 2005 the iraqi people held three national elections choosing a transitional government adopting the most progressive democratic constitution in the arab world and then electing a government under that constitution despite endless threats from the killers in their midst nearly 12 million iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget a thinking enemy watched all of these scenes adjusted their tactics and in 2006 they struck back in lebanon assassins took the life of pierre gemayel a prominent participant in the cedar revolution hizballah terrorists with support from syria and iran sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine lebanon's legitimately elected government in afghanistan taliban and al qaida fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging afghan and nato forces in iraq al qaida and other sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in shi'a islam the golden mosque of samarra this atrocity directed at a muslim house of prayer was designed to provoke retaliation from iraqi shi'a and it succeeded radical shi'a elements some of whom receive support from iran formed death squads the result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day this is not the fight we entered in iraq but it is the fight we're in every one of us wishes this war were over and won yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept our friends abandoned and our own security at risk ladies and gentlemen on this day at this hour it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle let us find our resolve and turn events toward victory we're carrying out a new strategy in iraq a plan that demands more from iraq's elected government and gives our forces in iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission our goal is a democratic iraq that upholds the rule of law respects the rights of its people provides them security and is an ally in the war on terror in order to make progress toward this goal the iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital but the iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own so we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20 000 additional soldiers and marines to iraq the vast majority will go to baghdad where they will help iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods and serve as advisers embedded in iraqi army units with iraqis in the lead our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists insurgents and the roaming death squads and in anbar province where al qaida terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them we're sending an additional 4 000 united states marines with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out we didn't drive al qaida out of their safe haven in afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free iraq the people of iraq want to live in peace and now it's time for their government to act iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open ended they have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure baghdad and they must do so they pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party and they need to follow through and lift needless restrictions on iraqi and coalition forces so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of baghdad iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks to achieve reconciliation to share oil revenues among all of iraq's citizens to put the wealth of iraq into the rebuilding of iraq to allow more iraqis to reenter their nation's civic life to hold local elections and to take responsibility for security in every iraqi province but for all of this to happen baghdad must be secure and our plan will help the iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments my fellow citizens our military commanders and i have carefully weighed the options we discussed every possible approach in the end i chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success many in this chamber understand that america must not fail in iraq because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far reaching if american forces step back before baghdad is secure the iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides we could expect an epic battle between shi'a extremists backed by iran and sunni extremists aided by al qaida and supporters of the old regime a contagion of violence could spill out across the country and in time the entire region could be drawn into the conflict for america this is a nightmare scenario for the enemy this is the objective chaos is the greatest ally their greatest ally in this struggle and out of chaos in iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens new recruits new resources and an even greater determination to harm america to allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of september the 11th and invite tragedy ladies and gentlemen nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for america to succeed in the middle east to succeed in iraq and to spare the american people from this danger this is where matters stand tonight in the here and now i have spoken with many of you in person i respect you and the arguments you've made we went into this largely united in our assumptions and in our convictions and whatever you voted for you did not vote for failure our country is pursuing a new strategy in iraq and i ask you to give it a chance to work and i ask you to support our troops in the field and those on their way the war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and i have turned our duties over to others and that's why it's important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through both parties and both branches should work in close consultation it's why i've proposed to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror made up of leaders in congress from both political parties we will share ideas for how to position america to meet every challenge that confronts us we'll show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory and one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the american armed forces are ready for all the challenges ahead tonight i ask the congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active army and marine corps by 92 000 in the next 5 years a second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps such a corps would function much like our military reserve it would ease the burden on the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when america needs them it would give people across america who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone we have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism in iraq multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the united nations we're working with jordan and saudi arabia and egypt and the gulf states to increase support for iraq's government the united nations has imposed sanctions on iran and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in tehran to acquire nuclear weapons with the other members of the quartet'the u n the eu and russia'we're pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the holy land and pursuing the establishment of a democratic palestinian state living side by side with israel in peace and security in afghanistan nato has taken the lead in turning back the taliban and al qaida offensive the first time the alliance has deployed forces outside the north atlantic area together with our partners in china and japan russia and south korea we're pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons we will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like cuba belarus and burma and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of darfur american foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth to whom much is given much is required we hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease and that is precisely what america is doing we must continue to fight hiv aids especially on the continent of africa because you funded the emergency plan for aids relief the number of people receiving lifesaving drugs has grown from 50 000 to more than 800 000 in 3 short years i ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight hiv aids and i ask you to provide 1 2 billion over 5 years so we can combat malaria in 15 african countries i ask that you fund the millennium challenge account so that american aid reaches the people who need it in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat and let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty when america serves others in this way we show the strength and generosity of our country these deeds reflect the character of our people the greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness and courage and self sacrifice of the american people you see this spirit often if you know where to look and tonight we need only look above to the gallery dikembe mutombo grew up in africa amid great poverty and disease he came to georgetown university on a scholarship to study medicine but coach john thompson took a look at dikembe and had a different idea dikembe became a star in the nba and a citizen of the united states but he never forgot the land of his birth or the duty to share his blessings with others he built a brand new hospital in his old hometown a friend has said of this good hearted man mutombo believes that god has given him this opportunity to do great things and we are proud to call this son of the congo a citizen of the united states of america after her daughter was born julie aigner clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child so she borrowed some equipment and began filming children's videos in her basement the baby einstein company was born and in just 5 years her business grew to more than 20 million in sales in november 2001 julie sold baby einstein to walt disney company and with her help baby einstein has grown into a 200 million business julie represents the great enterprising spirit of america and she is using her success to help others producing child safety videos with john walsh of the national center for missing and exploited children julie says of her new project i believe it is the most important thing i have ever done i believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe and so tonight we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur julie aigner clark three weeks ago wesley autrey was waiting at a harlem subway station with his two little girls when he saw a man fall into the path of a train with seconds to act wesley jumped onto the tracks pulled the man into the space between the rails and held him as the train passed right above their heads he insists he's not a hero he says we got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms we have got to show each other some love there is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like wesley autrey tommy rieman was a teenager pumping gas in independence kentucky when he enlisted in the united states army in december 2003 he was on a reconnaissance mission in iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire from his humvee sergeant rieman returned fire he used his body as a shield to protect his gunner he was shot in the chest and arm and received shrapnel wounds to his legs yet he refused medical attention and stayed in the fight he helped to repel a second attack firing grenades at the enemy's position for his exceptional courage sergeant rieman was awarded the silver star and like so many other americans who have volunteered to defend us he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country in such courage and compassion ladies and gentlemen we see the spirit and character of america and these qualities are not in short supply this is a decent and honorable country and resilient too we've been through a lot together we've met challenges and faced dangers and we know that more lie ahead yet we can go forward with confidence because the state of our union is strong our cause in the world is right and tonight that cause goes on god bless see you next year thank you for your prayers ,<nrclex.NRCLex object at

my own as the first President to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker.', ""In his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., from Baltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum."", 'But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives.', 'Congratulations, Madam Speaker.', 'Two Members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood.', 'Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: The rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour when decisions are hard and courage is needed.', 'We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway and others that are ours to begin.', 'In all of this, much is asked of us.', 'We must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies and the wisdom to face them together.', 'Some in this Chamber are new to the House and the Senate, and I congratulate the Democrat majority.', 'Congress has changed, but not our responsibilities.', 'Each of us is guided by our own convictions, and to these we must stay faithful.', ""Yet we're all held to the same standards and called to serve the same good purposes: to extend this Nation's prosperity, to spend the people's money wisely, to solve problems, not leave them to future generations, to guard America against all evil, and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us."", ""We're not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air."", 'Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and we can achieve big things for the American people.', ""Our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on, as long as we're willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done."", 'Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans and to help them build a future of hope and opportunity, and this is the business before us tonight.', 'A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy, and that is what we have.', ""We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs so far."", 'Unemployment is low; inflation is low; wages are rising.', 'This economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government but with more enterprise.', ""Next week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy."", 'Tonight I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress.', 'First, we must balance the Federal budget.', 'We can do so without raising taxes.', 'What we need is spending discipline in Washington, DC.', 'We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 and met that goal 3 years ahead of schedule.', 'Now let us take the next step.', 'In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the Federal deficit within the next 5 years.', 'I ask you to make the same commitment.', 'Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the Federal Government, and we can balance the Federal budget.', 'Next, there is the matter of earmarks.', 'These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour, when not even C-SPAN is watching.', 'In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion.', 'Even worse, over 90 percent of the earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate.', 'They are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk.', ""You didn't vote them into law, I didn't sign them into law, yet they're treated as if they have the force of law."", 'The time has come to end this practice.', 'So let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session.', 'And finally, to keep this economy strong, we must take on the challenge of entitlements.', 'Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound.', ""Yet we're failing in that duty."", 'And this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits.', 'Everyone in this Chamber knows this to be true, yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act.', 'So let us work together and do it now.', 'With enough good sense and good will, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid and save Social Security.', 'Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life.', 'Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding schools accountable for results.', 'And because we acted, students are performing better in reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap.', 'Now the task is to build on the success without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform.', 'We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better.', 'We must increase funds for students who struggle and make sure these children get the special help they need.', 'And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills.', ""The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's children, and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law."", 'A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care.', 'When it comes to health care, Government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children, and we will meet those responsibilities.', 'For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs.', 'But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy, and so tonight I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance.', 'First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents.', 'Families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax—or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income.', 'Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income.', 'With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills.', 'At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job.', 'For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings, $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year.', 'And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic, private health insurance plan within their reach.', 'Changing the Tax Code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.', 'My second proposal is to help the States that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured.', 'States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive Federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick.', 'I have asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing Federal funds and use them to create Affordable Choices grants.', ""These grants would give our Nation's Governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need."", 'There are many other ways that Congress can help.', 'We need to expand health savings accounts.', 'We need to help small businesses through association health plans.', 'We need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology.', 'We will encourage price transparency.', 'And to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we need to pass medical liability reform.', 'In all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are not made by government and insurance companies but by patients and their doctors.', 'Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of America, with laws that are fair and borders that are secure.', 'When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country.', ""To secure our border, we're doubling the size of the Border Patrol and funding new infrastructure and technology."", 'Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border, and that requires a temporary-worker program.', 'We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis.', ""As a result, they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists."", ""We'll enforce our immigration laws at the worksite and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there's no excuse left for violating the law."", 'We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals.', 'We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty.', 'Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration.', 'Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass and I can sign comprehensive immigration reform into law.', ""Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean."", 'For too long, our Nation has been dependent on foreign oil.', 'And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments and raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy.', ""It's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply."", 'The way forward is through technology.', 'We must continue changing the way America generates electric power by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power.', 'We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel.', 'We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol, using everything from wood chips to grasses to agricultural wastes.', 'We made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market.', 'And now even more dramatic advances are within reach.', 'Tonight I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal.', ""Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years."", 'When we do that, we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the Middle East.', 'To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017, and that is nearly five times the current target.', 'At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks, and conserve up to 81⁄2 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017.', ""Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it."", 'And so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways.', 'And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.', 'America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil.', 'And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change.', 'A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice.', 'The lives of our citizens across our Nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our Federal courts.', 'We have a shared obligation to ensure that the Federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings.', 'As President, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the Federal bench, and the United States Senate has a duty as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.', 'For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger.', 'Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause.', ""We've had time to take stock of our situation."", ""We've added many critical protections to guard the homeland."", 'We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us, unless we stop them.', 'With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed.', 'Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions.', 'Yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror, we must take the fight to the enemy.', 'From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense.', 'The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over.', 'For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same.', 'Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen.', 'We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know.', 'We stopped an Al Qaida plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast.', 'We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States.', 'We uncovered an Al Qaida cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America.', 'And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean.', 'For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them.', 'Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy.', 'The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world.', ""And so long as that's the case, America is still a nation at war."", 'In the mind of the terrorists, this war began well before September the 11th and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled.', 'And these past 5 years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy.', 'Al Qaida and its followers are Sunni extremists possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology.', 'Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite.', 'They preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent.', 'Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions.', 'They want to overthrow moderate governments and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country.', 'By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty.', 'They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology.', 'Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: ""We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse.""', 'Usama bin Laden declared: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us.""', 'These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement.', ""In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shi'a extremists who are just as hostile to America and are also determined to dominate the Middle East."", 'Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like Hizballah, a group second only to Al Qaida in the American lives it has taken.', ""The Shi'a and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat."", 'Whatever slogans they chant when they slaughter the innocent, they have the same wicked purposes.', 'They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale.', 'In the sixth year since our Nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangers have ended.', 'They have not.', 'And so it remains the policy of this Government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people.', 'This war is more than a clash of arms; it is a decisive ideological struggle.', 'And the security of our Nation is in the balance.', 'To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us.', 'What every terrorist fears most is human freedom: societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments.', ""Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies, and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance."", 'So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy.', 'The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity.', 'And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must.', ""In the last 2 years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East, and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction."", 'In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution.', 'They drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections.', 'In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature.', 'And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic Constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a Government under that Constitution.', 'Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget.', 'A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and, in 2006, they struck back.', 'In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution.', ""Hizballah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected Government."", 'In Afghanistan, Taliban and Al Qaida fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces.', ""In Iraq, Al Qaida and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shi'a Islam, the Golden Mosque of Samarra."", ""This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shi'a, and it succeeded."", ""Radical Shi'a elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads."", 'The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day.', ""This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we're in."", 'Every one of us wishes this war were over and won.', 'Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, on this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle.', 'Let us find our resolve and turn events toward victory.', ""We're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq, a plan that demands more from Iraq's elected Government and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission."", 'Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of its people, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror.', 'In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi Government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital.', 'But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own.', ""So we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and marines to Iraq."", 'The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units.', 'With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads.', ""And in Anbar Province, where Al Qaida terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out."", ""We didn't drive Al Qaida out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq."", ""The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their Government to act."", ""Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open ended."", 'They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad, and they must do so.', 'They pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party, and they need to follow through and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad.', ""Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks: to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to reenter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi Province."", 'But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secure, and our plan will help the Iraqi Government take back its capital and make good on its commitments.', 'My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options.', 'We discussed every possible approach.', 'In the end, I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success.', 'Many in this Chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far-reaching.', 'If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi Government would be overrun by extremists on all sides.', ""We could expect an epic battle between Shi'a extremists backed by Iran and Sunni extremists aided by Al Qaida and supporters of the old regime."", 'A contagion of violence could spill out across the country, and, in time, the entire region could be drawn into the conflict.', 'For America, this is a nightmare scenario; for the enemy, this is the objective.', 'Chaos is the greatest ally, their greatest ally in this struggle.', 'And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to harm America.', 'To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq, and to spare the American people from this danger.', 'This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now.', 'I have spoken with many of you in person.', ""I respect you and the arguments you've made."", 'We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions.', 'And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure.', 'Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work.', 'And I ask you to support our troops in the field and those on their way.', 'The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others.', ""And that's why it's important to work together so our Nation can see this great effort through."", 'Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation.', ""It's why I've proposed to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties."", 'We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us.', ""We'll show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory."", 'And one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead.', 'Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next 5 years.', 'A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps.', 'Such a corps would function much like our military reserve.', 'It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them.', 'It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time.', ""Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone."", 'We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism.', 'In Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United Nations.', ""We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf States to increase support for Iraq's Government."", 'The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons.', ""With the other members of the Quartet—the U.N., the EU, and Russia—we're pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in peace and security."", 'In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning back the Taliban and Al Qaida offensive, the first time the Alliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area.', ""Together with our partners in China and Japan, Russia and South Korea, we're pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons."", 'We will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, and Burma, and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur.', 'American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy.', 'Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required.', 'We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease, and that is precisely what America is doing.', 'We must continue to fight HIV/ AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa.', 'Because you funded the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving lifesaving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in 3 short years.', 'I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, and I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over 5 years so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries.', 'I ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat.', 'And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty.', 'When America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country.', 'These deeds reflect the character of our people.', 'The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness and courage and self-sacrifice of the American people.', 'You see this spirit often if you know where to look, and tonight we need only look above to the gallery.', 'Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa amid great poverty and disease.', 'He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine, but Coach John Thompson took a

are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of the United States of America.', 'After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child.', ""So she borrowed some equipment and began filming children's videos in her basement."", 'The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just 5 years, her business grew to more than $20 million in sales.', 'In November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to Walt Disney Company, and with her help, Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business.', 'Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America.', 'And she is using her success to help others, producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.', 'Julie says of her new project: ""I believe it is the most important thing I have ever done.', 'I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe.""', 'And so tonight we are pleased to welcome this

"Good afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against Al Qaida terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. These carefully targeted actions are designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime. We are joined in this operation by our staunch friend Great Britain. Other close friends, including Canada, Australia, Germany, and France, have pledged forces as the operation unfolds. More than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and across Asia have granted air transit or landing rights. Many more have shared intelligence. We are supported by the collective will of the world. More than 2 weeks ago, I gave Taliban leaders a series of clear and specific demands: Close terrorist training camps; hand over leaders of the Al Qaida network; and return all foreign nationals, including American citizens, unjustly detained in your country. None of these demands were met. And now the Taliban will pay a price. By destroying camps and disrupting communications, we will make it more difficult for the terror network to train new recruits and coordinate their evil plans. Initially, the terrorists may burrow deeper into caves and other entrenched hiding places. Our military action is also designed to clear the way for sustained, comprehensive, and relentless operations to drive them out and bring them to justice. At the same time, the oppressed people of Afghanistan will know the generosity of America and our allies. As we strike military targets, we'll also drop food, medicine, and supplies to the starving and suffering men and women and children of Afghanistan. The United States of America is a friend to the Afghan people, and we are the friends of almost a billion worldwide who practice the Islamic faith. The United States of America is an enemy of those who aid terrorists and of the barbaric criminals who profane a great religion by committing murder in its name. This military action is a part of our campaign against terrorism, another front in a war that has already been joined through diplomacy, intelligence, the freezing of financial assets, and the arrests of known terrorists by law enforcement agents in 38 countries. Given the nature and reach of our enemies, we will win this conflict by the patient accumulation of successes, by meeting a series of challenges with determination and will and purpose. Today we focus on Afghanistan, but the battle is broader. Every nation has a choice to make. In this conflict, there is no neutral ground. If any government sponsors the outlaws and killers of innocents, they have become outlaws and murderers, themselves. And they will take that lonely path at their own peril. I'm speaking to you today from the Treaty Room of the White House, a place where American Presidents have worked for peace. We're a peaceful nation. Yet, as we have learned so suddenly and so tragically, there can be no peace in a world of sudden terror. In the face of today's new threat, the only way to pursue peace is to pursue those who threaten it. We did not ask for this mission, but we will fulfill it. The name of today's military operation is Enduring Freedom. We defend not only our precious freedoms but also the freedom of people everywhere to live and raise their children free from fear. I know many Americans feel fear today, and our Government is taking strong precautions. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies are working aggressively around America, around the world, and around the clock. At my request, many Governors have activated the National Guard to strengthen airport security. We have called up Reserves to reinforce our military capability and strengthen the protection of our homeland. In the months ahead, our patience will be one of our strengths: patience with the long waits that will result from tighter security; patience and understanding that it will take time to achieve our goals; patience in all the sacrifices that may come. Today those sacrifices are being made by members of our Armed Forces who now defend us so far from home, and by their proud and worried families. A Commander in Chief sends America's sons and daughters into a battle in a foreign land only after the greatest care and a lot of prayer. We ask a lot of those who wear our uniform. We ask them to leave their loved ones, to travel great distances, to risk injury, even to be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice of their lives. They are dedicated; they are honorable; they represent the best of our country. And we are grateful. To all the men and women in our military—every sailor, every soldier, every airman, every coastguardsman, every marine— I say this: Your mission is defined; your objectives are clear; your goal is just; you have my full confidence; and you will have every tool you need to carry out your duty. I recently received a touching letter that says a lot about the state of America in these difficult times, a letter from a fourthgrade girl with a father in the military: ""As much as I don't want my dad to fight,"" she wrote, ""I'm willing to give him to you."" This is a precious gift, the greatest she could give. This young girl knows what America is all about. Since September 11, an entire generation of young Americans has gained new understanding of the value of freedom and its cost in duty and in sacrifice. The battle is now joined on many fronts. We will not waver; we will not tire; we will not falter; and we will not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail. Thank you. May God continue to bless America.",address-the-nation-announcing-strikes-against-al-qaida-training-camps-and-taliban-military.txt,8,good afternoon on my orders the united states military has begun

"Good afternoon and welcome to the White House. Laura and I are pleased that all of you could join us in witnessing a very meaningful event in the life of our Nation. It's a rare privilege to welcome seven current Justices of the Supreme Court. Thank you all for coming. We also welcome Mrs. Thurgood Marshall and Mrs. Potter Stewart. It was 19 years ago, almost to the day, that Chief Justice William Rehnquist took the oath of office in this very room with President Ronald Reagan as a witness. Each gathering of this kind is an historic occasion for our country and gives eloquent testimony to the wisdom and continuity of the system created by the Framers. In a few moments, John Roberts will take his place in a distinguished line that began in 1789, when President Washington appointed Chief Justice John Jay. This is a proud day for John Roberts's family. We extend a special welcome to his wife, Jane, their daughter, Josie, and son, Jack, a fellow who is comfortable with the cameras.  Also with us are the Judge's mom and dad, Rosemary and Jack Roberts; two of his sisters, Peggy and Barbara, as well as other members of the Roberts family. We're so pleased you'd be with us today. I appreciate the Vice President being here, Attorney General Al Gonzales. I thank Harriet Miers, Counsel to the President, and members of my administration who worked on the nomination and confirmation. I particularly want to thank former Senator Fred Thompson for his leadership. I thank the members of my Cabinet who are here. I appreciate the Members of the United States Senate who are here, Majority Leader Bill Frist, Senate President Pro Tem Ted Stevens, and Majority Whip Mitch McConnell. Thank you all for coming. I thank the members of the Judiciary Committee who are here, starting with the chairman, Arlen Specter, ranking member Pat Leahy. Thank you all for coming. I appreciate Senators Grassley, Hatch, Brownback, Kyl, Sessions, Cornyn, and Graham. I also want to thank all the other Senators here with us. I really want to say something about Senator Dick Lugar from Indiana, who introduced the Chief to the Senate. I appreciate very much all of you taking time out of your day to witness this historic event. Today we complete a process set forth in Article II of the Constitution, which provides that the President shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint the judges of the Supreme Court. The nomination power is one of the most serious responsibilities of a President. When a President chooses a Supreme Court Justice, he is placing in human hands the full authority and majesty of the law. Each member of our highest court holds a position of extraordinary influence and respect, and can hold it for a lifetime. The office of Chief Justice has added responsibilities as leader of the Court and as presiding officer of the Judicial Conference of the United States. To carry out all these duties, I submitted to the Senate a nominee of integrity, deep humility, and uncommon talent. During the confirmation hearings this month, Members of the Senate and American people saw far more than the intellectual gifts and broad experience of Judge John Roberts. They witnessed as well the character of the man, his reverence for the Constitution and laws of our country, his impartiality and devotion to justice, his modesty and great personal decency. Across the Nation, Americans have grown in respect and admiration for this good man. From the day of Judge Roberts's nomination, the Judiciary Committee and Senators of both parties have received him with courtesy and fair mindedness. The civility of the confirmation process has served the interests of the Nation and reflected very well on the United States Senate. And I appreciate the majority leader and the chairman and their colleagues for setting a tone of dignity and goodwill. The Senate has confirmed a man with an astute mind and kind heart. As a member of the Federal judiciary, John Roberts has carried out his duties with discernment and humanity and without fear or favor. As Judge Roberts prepares to lead the judicial branch of Government, all Americans can be confident that the 17th Chief Justice of the United States will be prudent in exercising judicial power, firm in defending judicial independence, and above all, a faithful guardian of the Constitution. With these qualities, the incoming Chief Justice will carry on in the tradition of his mentor and friend, the late William H. Rehnquist. I know that Chief Justice Rehnquist had hoped to welcome his former law clerk as a colleague. Although that was not meant to be, we are thinking of William Rehnquist today. The Nation honors his memory, and we remain grateful for his example of integrity and service. In welcoming an exceptional new leader as Chief Justice, we also honor the Supreme Court itself, and we mark a day of renewal for one of the noblest institutions in our land. Judge Roberts, thank you for agreeing to serve our country and for accepting this new call to duty. And now I ask Senior Associate Justice of the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens, to please step forward and administer the oath. Chief Justice Roberts. Thank you very much. Let me begin by thanking Justice John Paul Stevens for being here today. In December, Justice Stevens will mark 30 years of service on the Court. It's a great honor to take the oath from him, and it will be a great privilege for me to sit next to him on the bench on Monday. Thank you, Mr. President, for nominating me. There is no way to repay the confidence you have shown in me, other than to do the best job I possibly can do, and I will try to do that every day. And thank you for the remarkable team that you assembled to assist me throughout this process. I benefitted greatly from the wisdom, judgment, and plain hard work of Ed Gillespie, Senator Thompson, Harriet Miers, Bill Kelley, and everyone on the team. I am very grateful to each and every one of them. Chairman Specter, Senator Leahy, all the members of the Judiciary Committee, with this nomination, the Committee faced a very special challenge. And yet, working together, we met that challenge. We found a way to get Jack into the Committee room——introduced to the Committee and back out again without any serious crisis.  Thank you. More seriously, thank you very much for the conduct of the hearings, conducting them in a civil and dignified manner as the President requested on the night of the nomination. I appreciate it very much. Senator Frist, other Members of the Senate, I view the vote this morning as confirmation of what is for me a bedrock principle, that judging is different from politics. And I appreciate the vote very much. The process we have just completed epitomizes the separation of powers that is enshrined in our Constitution. My nomination was announced some 10 weeks ago here in the White House, the home of the executive branch. This morning, further up Pennsylvania Avenue, it was approved in the Capitol, the home of the executive branch. And tomorrow, I will go into the Supreme Court building to join my colleagues, the home of the judicial branch, to undertake my duties. The executive and the legislature have carried out their constitutional responsibilities and ensured the succession of authority and responsibility in the judicial branch. What Daniel Webster termed ""the miracle of our Constitution"" is not something that happens every generation. But every generation in its turn must accept the responsibility of supporting and defending the Constitution and bearing true faith and allegiance to it. That is the oath that I just took. I will try to ensure, in the discharge of my responsibilities, that with the help of my colleagues, I can pass on to my children's generation a charter of self-government as strong and as vibrant as the one that Chief Justice Rehnquist passed on to us. Over the past 10 weeks, many people who I did not know came up to me and offered encouragement and support. Many of them told me that I and my family was in their prayers and in their hopes. I want to thank all of those people. I will need in the months and years ahead that encouragement and those prayers. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Members of the Senate. And thank you, colleagues, for being here to share this special moment. Thank you.

Court."", 'Thank you all for coming.', 'We also welcome Mrs. Thurgood Marshall and Mrs. Potter Stewart.', 'It was 19 years ago, almost to the day, that Chief Justice William Rehnquist took the oath of office in this very room with President Ronald Reagan as a witness.', 'Each gathering of this kind is an historic occasion for our country and gives eloquent testimony to the wisdom and continuity of the system created by the Framers.', 'In a few moments, John Roberts will take his place in a distinguished line that began in 1789, when President Washington appointed Chief Justice John Jay.', ""This is a proud day for John Roberts's family."", 'We extend a special welcome to his wife, Jane, their daughter, Josie, and son, Jack, a fellow who is comfortable with the cameras.', ""Also with us

very much all of you taking time out of your day to witness this historic event.', 'Today we complete a process set forth in Article II of the Constitution, which provides that the President shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint the judges of the Supreme Court.', 'The nomination power is one of the most serious responsibilities of a President.', 'When a President chooses a Supreme Court Justice, he is placing in human hands the full authority and majesty of the law.', 'Each member of our highest court holds a position of extraordinary influence and respect, and can hold it for a lifetime.', 'The office of Chief Justice has added responsibilities as leader of the Court and as presiding officer of the Judicial Conference of the United States.', 'To carry out all these duties, I submitted to the Senate a nominee of integrity, deep humility, and uncommon talent.', 'During the confirmation hearings this month, Members of the Senate and American people saw far more than the intellectual gifts and broad experience of Judge John Roberts.', 'They witnessed as well the character of the man, his reverence for the Constitution and laws of our country, his impartiality and devotion to justice, his modesty and great personal decency.', 'Across the Nation, Americans have grown in respect and admiration for this good man.', ""From the day of Judge Roberts's nomination, the Judiciary Committee and Senators of both parties have received him with courtesy and fair mindedness."", 'The civility of the confirmation process has served the

favor.', 'As Judge Roberts prepares to lead the judicial branch of Government, all Americans can be confident that the 17th Chief Justice of the United States will be prudent in exercising judicial power, firm in defending judicial independence, and above all, a faithful guardian of the Constitution.', 'With these qualities, the incoming Chief Justice will carry on in the tradition of his mentor and friend, the late William H. Rehnquist.', 'I know that Chief Justice Rehnquist had hoped to welcome his former law clerk as a colleague.', 'Although that was not meant to be, we are thinking of William Rehnquist today.', 'The

Committee room——introduced to the Committee and back out again without any serious crisis.', 'Thank you.', 'More seriously, thank you very much for the conduct of the hearings, conducting them in a civil and dignified manner as the President requested on the night of the nomination.', 'I appreciate it very much.', 'Senator Frist, other Members of the Senate, I view the vote this morning as confirmation of what is for me a bedrock principle, that judging is different from politics.', 'And I appreciate the vote very much.', 'The process we have just completed epitomizes the separation of powers that is enshrined in our Constitution.', 'My nomination was announced some 10 weeks ago here in the White House, the home of the executive branch.', 'This morning, further up Pennsylvania Avenue, it was approved in the Capitol, the home of the executive branch.', 'And tomorrow, I will go into the Supreme Court building to join my colleagues, the home of the judicial branch, to undertake my duties.', 'The executive and the legislature have carried out their constitutional responsibilities and ensured the succession of authority and responsibility in the judicial branch.', 'What Daniel Webster termed ""the miracle of our Constitution"" is not something that happens every generation.', 'But every generation in its turn must accept the responsibility of supporting and defending the Constitution and bearing true faith and allegiance to it.', 'That is the oath that I just took.', ""I will try to ensure, in the discharge of my responsibilities, that with the help of my colleagues, I can pass on to my children's generation a charter of self-government as strong and as vibrant as the one that Chief Justice Rehnquist passed on to us."", 'Over the past 10 weeks, many people who I did not know came up to me and offered encouragement and support.', 'Many of them told me that I and my family was in their prayers and in their hopes.', 'I want to thank all of those

"Thank you. Sit down. Behave yourself. You're at the White House.  Laura, thank you very much for being here on this historic moment. Mr. Vice President, Secretary O'Neill, Director Daniels, Secretary Evans and Chao are here, as well. Secretary Abraham, Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, Members of the United States Senate, Members of the House of Representatives, fellow Americans, welcome. Some months ago, in my speech to the joint session of Congress, I had the honor of introducing Steven Ramos to the Nation. Steven is the network administrator for a school district. His wife, Josefina, teaches at a charter school. They have a little girl named Lianna, and they're trying to save for Lianna's college education. High taxes made saving difficult. Last year they paid nearly $8,000 in Federal income taxes. Well, today we're beginning to make life for the Ramos' a lot easier. Today we start to return some of the Ramos' money and not only their money but the money of everybody who paid taxes in the United States of America. Across the board tax relief does not happen often in Washington, DC. In fact, since World War II, it has happened only twice: President Kennedy's tax cut in the sixties and President Reagan's tax cuts in the 1980s. And now it's happening for the third time, and it's about time. A year ago tax relief was said to be a political impossibility. Six months ago it was supposed to be a political liability. Today it becomes reality. It becomes reality because of the bipartisan leadership of the Members of the United States Congress, Members like Bill Thomas of California, Ralph Hall of Texas, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Max Baucus of Montana, Zell Miller of Georgia, John Breaux of Louisiana, Trent Lott of Mississippi and the entire leadership team in the Senate, and Denny Hastert of Illinois and the leadership team in the House of Representatives—some Democrats, many Republicans—who worked tirelessly and effectively to produce this important result. I also want to pay tribute to the members of my administration who worked with Congress to bring about this day: Vice President Cheney, Secretary O'Neill, Director Daniels, and the team inside the White House of Andy Card and Larry Lindsey, Nick Calio, and their staffs. With us today are 15 of the many families I met as I toured our country making the case for tax relief—hard-working Americans. I was able to talk about their stories and their struggles and their hopes, which made the case for tax relief much stronger than my words could possible convey. And I want to thank you all for coming. And here at the White House today are representatives of millions of Americans, including labor union members, small-business owners, and family farmers. Your persistence and determination helped bring us to this day. The American people should be proud of your efforts on their behalf, and I personally thank you all for coming. Tax relief is a great achievement for the American people. Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in Washington, and it was produced in record time. Tax relief is an achievement for families struggling to enter the middle class. For hard-working lower income families, we have cut the bottom rate of Federal income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. We doubled the per-child tax credit to $1,000 and made it refundable. Tax relief is compassionate, and it is now on the way. Tax relief is an achievement for middle class families squeezed by high energy prices and credit card debt. Most families can look forward to a $600 tax rebate before they have to pay the September backto-school bills. And in the years ahead, taxpayers can look forward to steadily declining income tax rates. Tax relief is an achievement for families that want the Government tax policy to be fair and not penalize them for making good choices, good choices such as marriage and raising a family. So we cut the marriage penalty. Tax relief makes the code more fair for small businesses and farmers and individuals by eliminating the death tax. Over the long haul, tax relief will encourage work and innovation. It will allow American workers to save more on their pension plan or individual retirement accounts. Tax relief expands individual freedom. The money we return, or don't take in the first place, can be saved for a child's education, spent on family needs, invested in a home or in a business or a mutual fund or used to reduce personal debt. The message we send today: It's up to the American people; it's the American people's choice. We recognize, loud and clear, the surplus is not the Government's money. The surplus is the people's money, and we ought to trust them with their own money. This tax relief plan is principled. We cut taxes for every income-tax payer. We target nobody in; we target nobody out. And tax relief is now on the way. Today is a great day for America. It is the first major achievement of a new era, an era of steady cooperation. And more achievements are ahead. I thank the Members of Congress in both parties who made today possible. Together, we will lead our country to new progress and new possibilities. It is now my honor to sign the first broad tax relief in a generation.

"Setting The Record Straight On The Scope Of The NSA Terrorist Surveillance Program. Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) Calls The NSA Program A ""Domestic Spying Program."" ""That is why Americans of all backgrounds and political parties are concerned about the NSA's domestic spying program."" (Sen. Harry Reid, Press Release, 1/23/06) But The President's Authorization Only Covers International Communications In Which One Party Is Suspected Of Links To Al Qaeda Or Related Terrorist Organizations.  Deputy Director Of National Intelligence General Michael Hayden: ""One End Of Any Call Targeted Under This Program Is Always Outside The United States."" GEN. HAYDEN: ""I don't think domestic spying makes it. One end of any call targeted under this program is always outside the United States. I've flown a lot in this country, and I've taken literally hundreds of domestic flights. I have never boarded a domestic flight in the United States of America and landed in Waziristan. In the same way - and I'm speaking illustratively here now, this is just an example - if NSA had intercepted al Qaeda Ops Chief Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in Karachi talking to Mohamed Atta in Laurel, Maryland, in say, July of 2001 - if NSA had done that, and the results had been made public, I'm convinced that the crawler on all the 7 by 24 news networks would not have been 'NSA domestic spying.'""

"Thank you all. Please be seated. Mr. Secretary, thank you for that introduction. We're all pleased to be here at the Department of Energy. I particularly want to thank the employees here for their daily efforts to help our country meet its energy needs. Thanks for your hard work. Sam, thank you for your leadership. As Sam mentioned, I firmly believe this country needs to have a comprehensive energy strategy, and I appreciate the Members of Congress for understanding that as well. Two years ago, I was pleased to stand with Members—many of whom are here— to sign a bill that was the first major energy security legislation in more than a decade. At the time, I recognized that we needed to go even further. And so in my State of the Union, I proposed an aggressive plan to reduce oil consumption of gasoline by 20 percent over 10 years. Today we make a major step with the Energy Independence and Security Act. We make a major step toward reducing our dependence on oil, confronting global climate change, expanding the production of renewable fuels, and giving future generations of our country a nation that is stronger, cleaner, and more secure. I do welcome members of the Cabinet who've joined us. I particularly want to thank the Speaker and the leader. I appreciate your leadership on this important issue. Speaker Pelosi is here with Congressman Steny Hoyer, House majority leader. Welcome, Mr. Leader. Leader Reid has brought Members of the Senate with him: Senator Inouye, Senator Bingaman, Senator Stevens—I think that's Senator Domenici there in disguise with a—. Looking pretty handsome, isn't he? I appreciate Congressman Dingell and Congressman Markey, Congressman Gordon. These are all leaders on their respective committees that helped bring this bill to my desk. I also want to welcome all the other Members of Congress who've joined us. One of the most serious long-term challenges facing our country is dependence on oil, especially oil from foreign lands. It's a serious challenge. And Members of Congress up here understand the challenge, and so do I. Because this dependence harms us economically through high and volatile prices at the gas pump, dependence creates pollution and contributes to greenhouse gas admissions. It threatens our national security by making us vulnerable to hostile regimes in unstable regions of the world. It makes us vulnerable to terrorists who might attack oil infrastructure. The legislation I am signing today will address our vulnerabilities and our dependence in two important ways. First, it will increase the supply of alternative fuel sources. I proposed an alternative fuel standard earlier this year. This standard would require fuel producers to include a certain amount of alternative fuels in their products. This standard would create new markets for foreign products used to produce these fuels. This standard would increase our energy security by making us less vulnerable to instability, to the instability of oil prices on the world market. The bill I sign today takes a significant step because it will require fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel in 2022. This is nearly a fivefold increase over current levels. It will help us diversify our energy supplies and reduce our dependence on oil. It's an important part of this legislation, and I thank the Members of Congress for your wisdom. Second, the legislation also—will also reduce our demand for oil by increasing fuel economy standards. Last January, I called for the first statutory increase in fuel economy standards for automobiles since they were enacted in 1975. The bill I'm about to sign delivers on that request. It specifies a national standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, which will increase fuel economy standards by 40 percent and save billions of gallons of fuel. This bill also includes an important reform that I believe is essential to making sure that we realize this strategy. It allows the Department of Transportation to issue what are known as attribute-based standards, which will assure that increased fuel efficiency does not come at the expense of automobile safety. This is an important part of this bill, and again, I thank the Members for taking the lead. The bill also includes revisions to improve energy efficiency in lighting and appliances. It adopts elements of the Executive order I signed requiring Federal Agencies to lead by example in efficiency and renewable energy use. Taken together, all these measures will help us improve our environment. It is estimated that these initiatives could reduce projected CO2 emissions by billions of metric tons. The U.N. climate change meeting in Bali last week, our Nation promised to pursue new, quantifiable actions to reduce carbon emissions. Today we're doing just that. The legislation I'm signing today will lead to some of the largest CO2 emission cuts in our Nation's history. The legislation I'm about to sign should say to the American people that we can find common ground on critical issues. And there's more we can accomplish together. New technologies will bring about a new era of energy. So I appreciate the fact that Congress—in the omnibus spending bill that I'm going to sign later on—recognizes that new technologies will help usher in a better quality of life for our citizens. And so we're going to spend money on new research for alternative feedstocks for ethanol. I mean, we understand the hog growers are getting nervous because the price of corn is up. But we also believe strongly that research will enable us to use wood chips and switchgrass and biomass to be able to develop the ethanol necessary to help us realize the vision outlined in this bill. I appreciate very much the fact that we're going to fund additional research on new battery technologies to power plug-in hybrids. We're spending money on innovative ways to capture solar power. We're making—providing incentives for nuclear energy. If we're serious about making sure we grow our economy and deal with greenhouse gases, we have got to expand nuclear power. It is going to take time to transition to this new era. And we're still going to need hydrocarbons. And I hope the Congress will continue to open access to domestic energy sources: certain parts of the Outer Continental Shelf, in ANWR. And to protect us against disruptions in our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. With these steps—particularly in the bill I'm about to sign—we're going to help American consumers a lot. We'll help them by diversifying our supplies, which will help lower energy prices. We'll strengthen our security by helping to break our dependence on foreign oil. We'll do our duty to future generations by addressing climate change. And so I thank the Members of Congress. I appreciate the fact that we've worked together, that we can show what's possible in addressing the big issues facing our Nation. This is a good bill, and I'm pleased to sign it.

to be here at the Department of Energy."", 'I particularly want to thank the employees here for their daily efforts to help our country meet its energy needs.', 'Thanks for your hard work.', 'Sam, thank you for your leadership.', 'As Sam mentioned, I firmly believe this country needs to have a comprehensive energy strategy, and I appreciate the Members of Congress for understanding that as well.', 'Two years ago, I was pleased to stand with Members—many of whom are here— to sign a bill that was the first major energy security legislation in more than a decade.', 'At the time, I recognized that we needed to go even further.', 'And so in my State of the Union, I proposed an aggressive plan to reduce oil consumption of gasoline by 20 percent over 10 years.', 'Today we make a major step with the Energy Independence and Security Act.', 'We make a major step toward reducing our dependence on oil, confronting global climate change, expanding the production of renewable fuels, and giving future generations of our country a nation that is stronger, cleaner, and more secure.', ""I do welcome members of the Cabinet who've joined us."", 'I particularly want to thank the Speaker and the leader.', 'I appreciate your leadership on this important issue.', 'Speaker Pelosi is here with Congressman Steny Hoyer, House majority leader.', 'Welcome, Mr. Leader.', ""Leader Reid has brought Members of the Senate with him: Senator Inouye, Senator Bingaman, Senator Stevens—I think that's Senator Domenici there in disguise with a—."", ""Looking pretty handsome, isn't he?"", 'I appreciate Congressman Dingell and Congressman Markey, Congressman Gordon.', 'These are all leaders on their respective committees that helped bring this bill to my desk.', ""I also want to welcome all the other Members of Congress who've joined us."", 'One of the most serious long-term challenges facing our country is dependence on oil, especially oil from foreign lands.', ""It's a serious challenge."", 'And Members of Congress up here understand the challenge, and so do I.', 'Because this dependence harms us economically through high and volatile prices at the gas pump, dependence creates pollution and contributes to greenhouse gas admissions.', 'It threatens our national security by making us vulnerable to hostile regimes in unstable regions of the world.', 'It makes us vulnerable to terrorists who might attack oil infrastructure.', 'The legislation I am signing today will address our vulnerabilities and our dependence in two important ways.', 'First, it will increase the supply of alternative fuel sources.', 'I proposed an alternative fuel standard earlier this year.', 'This standard would require fuel producers to include a certain amount of alternative fuels in their products.', 'This standard would create new markets for foreign products used to produce these fuels.', 'This standard would increase our energy security by making us less vulnerable to instability, to the instability of oil prices on the world market.', 'The bill I sign today takes a significant step because it will require fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel in 2022.', 'This is nearly a fivefold increase over current levels.', 'It will help us diversify our energy supplies and reduce our dependence on oil.', ""It's an important part of this legislation, and I thank the Members of Congress for your wisdom."", 'Second, the legislation also—will also reduce our demand for oil by increasing fuel economy standards.', 'Last January, I called for the first statutory increase in fuel economy standards for automobiles since they were enacted in 1975.', ""The bill I'm about to sign delivers on that request."", 'It specifies a national standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, which will increase fuel economy standards by 40 percent and save billions of gallons of fuel.', 'This bill also includes an important reform that I believe is essential to making sure that we realize this strategy.', 'It allows the Department of Transportation to issue what are known as attribute-based standards, which will assure that increased fuel efficiency does not come at the expense of automobile safety.', 'This is an important part of this bill, and again, I thank the Members for taking the lead.', 'The bill also includes revisions to improve energy efficiency in lighting and appliances.', 'It adopts elements of the Executive order I signed requiring Federal Agencies to lead by example in efficiency and renewable energy use.', 'Taken together, all these measures will help us improve our environment.', 'It is estimated that these initiatives could reduce projected CO2 emissions by billions of metric tons.', 'The U.N. climate change meeting in Bali last week, our Nation promised to pursue new, quantifiable actions to reduce carbon emissions.', ""Today we're doing just that."", ""The legislation I'm signing today will lead to some of the largest CO2 emission cuts in our Nation's history."", ""The legislation I'm about to sign should say to the American people that we can find common ground on critical issues."", ""And there's more we can accomplish together."", 'New technologies will bring about a new era of energy.', ""So I appreciate the fact that Congress—in the omnibus spending bill that I'm going to sign later on—recognizes that new technologies will help usher in a better quality of life for our citizens."", ""And so we're going to spend money on new research for alternative feedstocks for ethanol."", 'I mean, we understand the hog growers are getting nervous because the price of corn is up.', 'But we also believe strongly that research will enable us to use wood chips and switchgrass and biomass to be able to develop the ethanol necessary to help us realize the vision outlined in this bill.', ""I appreciate very much the fact that we're going to fund additional research on new battery technologies to power plug-in hybrids."", ""We're spending money on innovative ways to capture solar power."", ""We're making—providing incentives for nuclear energy."", ""If we're serious about making sure we grow our economy and deal with greenhouse gases, we have got to expand nuclear power."", 'It is going to take time to transition to this new era.', ""And we're still going to need hydrocarbons."", 'And I hope the Congress will continue to open access to domestic energy sources: certain parts of the Outer Continental Shelf, in ANWR.', 'And to protect us against disruptions in our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.', ""With these steps—particularly in the bill I'm about to sign—we're going to help American consumers a lot."", ""We'll help them by diversifying our supplies, which will help lower energy prices."", ""We'll strengthen our security by helping to break our dependence on foreign oil."", ""We'll do our duty to future generations by addressing climate change."", 'And so I thank the Members of Congress.', ""I appreciate the fact that we've worked together, that we can show what's possible in addressing the big issues facing our Nation."", ""This is a good bill, and I'm pleased to sign it.""]","['Thank', 'you', 'all.', 'Please', 'be', 'seated.', 'Mr.', 'Secretary', ',', 'thank', 'you',

"Today, I have signed into law H.R. 6, the ""Energy Policy Act of 2005."" This legislation promotes dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound production and distribution of energy for America's future. The executive branch shall construe section 365(e)(2) of the Act, which purports to require disclosure of an internal executive branch recommendation, in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and preserve the confidentiality of its deliberations. The executive branch shall construe the statement in section 110(d) of the Act, that the Congress reserves the right to revert to previous schedules for daylight savings time, as referring to reversion by enactment of a law in accordance with the bicameral passage and presentment requirements specified in the Constitution. The executive branch shall construe the amendments to section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act made by section 629 of the Act, as they relate to dissemination of official information by employees of the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch. The executive branch shall construe provisions of the Act that purport to direct the conduct of communications, negotiations, and other relations with foreign governments and international organizations, including sections 643(c)(2), 795(d), 814, 972, and 985 of the Act, and sections 732, 734(a)(2), 736, and 737 of the Global Environmental Protection Assistance Act as contained in section 1611 of the Act, in a manner consistent with the Constitution's commitment to the President of authority to conduct the Nation's foreign relations.

The executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the Constitution's commitment to the President of the authority to submit for the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President judges necessary and expedient and to supervise the unitary executive branch. The executive branch shall construe the reference in section 631(b) of the Act, to awaiting action by the Congress, as providing for the Congress a reasonable period of time to consider the information furnished under section 631, as it is plain from the text and structure of section 631 that the reference is not intended to function as a prohibition. The executive branch shall construe section 9007 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, contained in section 1528 of the Act, in a manner consistent with the various legal immunities conferred by the Constitution on members of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the Federal Government to protect the effective functioning of the three branches. The executive branch shall construe provisions of the Act that make legislative classifications based on race, ethnicity, or gender in a manner consistent with the requirement of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to afford equal protection of the laws.

"We met today at Rancho San Cristobal, in Guanajuato, in a dialogue of friends and neighbors to agree on important goals and principles that will govern relations between our two countries. We are united, as never before, by values and interests that cover the entire span of our rich and broad relationship. That relationship is grounded in our respect for democracy and human rights, not just for ourselves but for all people in every nation. We share a fundamental commitment to free trade as an engine of economic growth and development that leaves nobody behind. And, we are committed to ensuring the rule of law, the framework on which our people's freedom and prosperity depends. This common outlook is the basis for a full, mature, and equitable partnership for prosperity. Among our highest priorities is unfettering the economic potential of every citizen, so each may contribute fully to narrowing the economic gaps between and within our societies. We acknowledge the dynamism achieved through NAFTA, which has ushered in dramatic increases in trade that have transformed our economic relationship. After consultation with our Canadian partners, we will strive to consolidate a North American economic community whose benefits reach the lesser-developed areas of the region and extend to the most vulnerable social groups in our countries. To this end, we support policies that result in sound fiscal accounts, low inflation, and strong financial systems. Migration is one of the major ties that bind our societies. It is important that our policies reflect our values and needs, and that we achieve progress in dealing with this phenomenon. We believe that Mexico should make the most of the skills and productivity of their workers at home, and we agree there should be an orderly framework for migration which ensures humane treatment, legal security, and dignified labor conditions. For this purpose, we are instructing our Governments to engage, at the earliest opportunity, in formal highlevel negotiations aimed at achieving short and long-term agreements that will allow us to constructively address migration and labor issues between our two countries. This effort will be chaired by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General of the U.S. and the Secretary of Foreign Relations and the Secretary of the Interior of Mexico. We attach the utmost importance to issues affecting the quality of life along our common border. We shall work for the economic and social development of our border communities, fight violence and strive to create a safe and orderly environment. We will form a new high-level working group under the auspices of the Binational Commission to identify specific steps each country can take to improve the efficiency of border operations. We will begin immediate discussions to implement the NAFTA panel decision on trucking. Drug trafficking, drug abuse, and organized crime are major threats to the wellbeing of our societies. To combat this threat, we must strengthen our respective law enforcement strategies and institutions, as well as develop closer and more trusting bilateral and multilateral cooperation. We want to reduce the demand for drugs and eliminate narcotrafficking organizations. To this end, we will undertake immediate steps to review law enforcement policies and coordination efforts in accordance with each country's national jurisdiction. We will consult with our NAFTA partner Canada regarding development of a North American approach to the important issue of energy resources. Building on the strength of our respective cultures, we will seek to expand our partnership broadly in ways that help secure a better future for our people. Education is a key to that future; we will increase exchanges and internships that help develop human capital and promote respect for each other's rich cultural heritage. We will seek new cooperation in science, technology, and the environment, on which much of our economic progress and our people's well-being will depend. Beyond the bilateral agenda, our two Governments are also ready to discuss regional and hemispheric issues important to both our nations. The Summit of the Americas, to be held in April in Quebec City, will provide a valuable forum in which the hemisphere's democracies can address and advance shared goals of strengthening democratic institutions and stimulating economic prosperity through free trade and education. We reaffirm our support for the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas as soon as possible. We believe our two nations can now build an authentic partnership for prosperity, based on shared democratic values and open dialogue that bring great benefits to our people. We want to move beyond the limitations of the past and boldly seize the unprecedented opportunity before us. In order to achieve these goals and follow up on the commitments we made today, we have agreed to meet frequently, as necessary, over the course of our respective terms of office. We will do so as friends, in a spirit of mutual trust and respect.",joint-statement-president-george-bush-and-president-vicente-fox-towards-partnership-for.txt,24,we met today at rancho san cristobal

"The President today signed the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. This legislation will strengthen our national security by ensuring a thorough and high-level review of acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign firms that may present security considerations. The legislation also demonstrates that America can meet the challenges of the post-9/11 world while continuing to welcome foreign investment that provides well-paying jobs and economic opportunity for our citizens. As the President made clear in his May 10 Statement on Open Investment, a climate conducive to foreign investment strengthens our national security. This Administration is committed to maintaining that climate at home, and will continue to seek it abroad.

"Good morning. I'm pleased to announce my nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the 81st Attorney General of the United States. Judge, thank you for agreeing to serve. The Attorney General serves as our Nation's chief law enforcement officer. The Attorney General has an especially vital role to play in a time of war, and when we face the challenges—and we face the challenge of protecting our people on a dailybasis from deadly enemies, while at the same time protecting our freedom. Judge Mukasey brings impressive credentials to this task. In 1987, he was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York. It's one of the country's busiest and most respected trial courts. He sat on that court for more than 18 years, and he earned the reputation as a tough, but fair judge. For 6 of those years, he was the chief judge, and he was a sound manager and a strong leader. Throughout his time on the bench, Judge Mukasey was widely admired for his brilliance and his integrity. Mike has experience in the Justice Department and private practice, as well as having served on the bench. He served 4 years as an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, where he tried many cases and he developed expertise in the workings of the criminal justice system. He's also worked as a partner in a law firm, and he holds degrees from Columbia University and Yale Law School. Some of Judge Mukasey's most important legal experience is in the area of national security. Judge Mukasey presided over the trial of the terrorist known as ""the Blind Sheikh"" and his codefendants in the conspiracy to destroy prominent New York City landmarks, including bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. Before the 9/11 attacks, this was one of the most important terrorism cases in our Nation's history, and the verdict in that case was affirmed on appeal. In affirming the convictions, the appeals court signaled out the judge for praise. I found it very interesting of—what they said. Here's what they wrote: ""The Honorable Michael B. Mukasey presided with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant, and helpfulness to the jury. His was an outstanding achievement in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured by a trial judge."" When the World Trade Center was attacked again, Judge Mukasey quickly reopened his court, even though it was just blocks from Ground Zero. He recognized the importance of maintaining a functioning justice system in the midst of a national emergency. He and other judges in his district worked day and night to ensure that applications for warrants were processed, investigations could proceed, and the rule of law was upheld. Judge Mukasey is clear eyed about the threat our Nation faces. As a judge and a private lawyer, he's written on matters of constitutional law and national security. He knows what it takes to fight this war effectively, and he knows how to do it in a manner that is consistent with our laws and our Constitution. And when confirmed by the Senate as Attorney General, he will work to ensure that our law enforcement and intelligence officers have the tools they need to protect the United States and our citizens. When he takes his place at the Department of Justice, he will succeed another fine judge, Alberto Gonzales. From his days as a supreme court justice in Texas to his years as White House Counsel and as Attorney General of the United States, this honorable and decent man has served with distinction. I've known Al and his family for more than a decade. He's a dear friend and a trusted adviser. I'm going to miss him, and I wish Al and Becky all the best. With Mike Mukasey, the Justice Department will be in the hands of a great lawyer and an accomplished public servant. Mike has shown good judgment in the courtroom; he's shown good judgment outside the courtroom. After all, he married a teacher. And we welcome Susan here, as well as son Marc and daughter Jessica. Thank you all for coming. He's also brought his sister Rhoda and brother-in-law Norm. I want to thank you all for supporting Mike as he takes on this important responsibility for our country. It's a pivotal time for our Nation, and it's vital that the position of Attorney General be filled quickly. I urge the Senate to confirm Judge Mukasey promptly. Until the judge is confirmed, Assistant Attorney General Paul Keisler will serve as Acting Attorney General. Accepting this assignment requires Peter—I said Peter—Peter Keisler. Accepting this assignment requires Peter to delay the departure date he announced earlier this month, and I appreciate his willingness to do so. Peter is the Acting Attorney General. Paul Clement, who agreed to take on this role, will remain focused on his duties as Solicitor General, so he can prepare for the Supreme Court term that begins just 2 weeks from today. Judge, I'm grateful for answering our Nation's call to serve. I look forward to welcome you as the next Attorney General of the United States.

"Today the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, determined that these housing mortgage companies cannot continue to operate safely and soundly and fulfill their public mission, posing an unacceptable risk to the broader financial system and our economy. FHFA announced that it will place the companies in conservatorship and appoint new leadership. The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve are taking additional steps that complement FHFA's actions and will support market stability, add to mortgage availability, and protect taxpayers. These agencies are taking the necessary steps to prevent a disruption of our financial system. Putting these companies on sound financial footing and reforming their business practices is critical to the health of our financial system and to making further progress with the housing correction that today is weighing heavily on our economy. Allowing the companies to fail or further deteriorate would damage our home mortgage market and could weaken other credit markets that are unrelated directly to housing. Americans should be confident that the actions taken today will strengthen our ability to weather the housing correction and are critical to returning the economy to stronger sustained growth in the future. The actions taken today are temporary and will support housing finance in the near term.

"Thank you all. Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I am honored by your support, and I accept your nomination for President of the United States. When I said those words 4 years ago, none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet morning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned of passengers on a doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers. We have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet. And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountain strongholds and charging through sandstorms and liberating millions with acts of valor that would make the men of Normandy proud. Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb and found the strength to climb them. Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below. Now, because we have faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach and greatness in our future. We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America, and nothing will hold us back. In the work we have done and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb Vice President. I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, and I am honored to have him at my side. I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush. Americans have come to see the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our First Lady. I'm a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women. I'm blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends. And I will always be the proud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush. My father served 8 years at the side of another great American, Ronald Reagan. His spirit of optimism and good will and decency are in this hall and are in our hearts and will always define our party. Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, the convictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A Presidential election is a contest for the future. Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead this country in the next 4 years. I believe every child can learn and every school must teach, so we passed the most important Federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children are making sustained progress in reading and math; America's schools are getting better; and nothing will hold us back. I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors, so I brought Republicans and Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors are getting immediate help buying medicine; soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage; and nothing will hold us back. I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and ranchers, so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation. Because we acted, our economy is growing again and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back. I believe the most solemn duty of the American President is to protect the American people. If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch. I'm running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world and a more hopeful America. I'm running with a compassionate conservative philosophy, that government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives. I believe this Nation wants steady, consistent, principled leadership, and that is why, with your help, we will win this election. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. The story of America is the story of expanding liberty, an ever-widening circle, constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our Nation's founding commitment is still our deepest commitment: In our world and here at home, we will extend the frontiers of freedom. The times in which we work and live are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents' generation typically had one job, one skill, one career, often with one company that provided health care and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs, even careers, many times during their lives. And in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen, two-thirds of all moms also work outside the home. This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a better living, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And Government must take your side. Many of our most fundamental systems, the Tax Code, health coverage, pension plans, worker training, were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transform these systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared—and thus truly free—to make your own choices and pursue your own dreams. My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy. We now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods but new competition for our workers. To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world to do business. To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining Federal spending, reducing regulation, and making the tax relief permanent. To create jobs, we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy. To create jobs, we will expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe. And we must protect small-business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolous lawsuits that threaten jobs across our country. Another drag on our economy is the current Tax Code, which is a complicated mess, filled with special interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than 6 billion hours of paperwork and headache every year. The American people deserve— and our economic future demands—a simpler, fairer, progrowth system. In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the Federal Tax Code. Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expanding economy to find better and higher paying jobs. In this time of change, many workers want to go back to school to learn different or higher level skills. So we will double the number of people served by our principal job training program and increase funding for our community colleges. I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone, anywhere in the world. In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others. To stand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, and other jobs, we will create American opportunity zones. In these areas, we will provide tax relief and other incentives to attract new business and improve housing and job training to bring hope and work throughout all of America. As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small-business owners who have told me that they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half of the uninsured are small-business employees and their families. In a new term, we must allow small firms to join together to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies. We will offer a tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. These accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to save tax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you change jobs. We will provide low-income Americans with better access to health care. In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community or rural health center. As I have traveled our country, I have met too many good doctors, especially ob-gyns, who are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now. And in all we do to improve health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC. In this time of change, Government must take the side of working families. In a new term, we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. Our laws should never stand in the way of a more family-friendly workplace. Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership brings security and dignity and independence. Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America is at an alltime high. Tonight we set a new goal: 7 million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say, ""Welcome to my home."" In an ownership society, more people will own their health care plans and have the confidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We'll always keep the promise of Social Security for our older workers. With the huge baby boom generation approaching retirement, many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will be there when they need it. We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to save some of their taxes in a personal account, a nest egg you can call your own and Government can never take away. In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a Government program but a path, a path to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life. And the path begins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, we must help our children reach as far as their vision and character can take them. Tonight I remind every parent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matter where you live, your school will be the path to promise of America. We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. We are insisting on accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are in charge of their schools. By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help, and we are providing a record level of funding to get them that help. In northeast Georgia, Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor, and this year 90 percent of the students passed State tests in reading and math. The principal expresses the philosophy of his school this way: ""We don't focus on what we can't do at this school. We focus on what we can do, and we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finish line."" See, this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations. And that is the spirit of our education reform and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ningun nino atras. We will leave no child behind. Audience members. Viva Bush! Viva Bush! Viva Bush! We are making progress—we are making progress, and there is more to do. In this time of change, most new jobs are filled by people with at least 2 years of college, yet only about one in four students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to help students at risk. We will place a new focus on math and science. As we make progress, we will require a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools and expanding Pell grants for low- and middle-income families, we will help more Americans start their career with a college diploma. America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the Government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need. Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online. The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember: georgewbush.com. These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, you face a choice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. Senator Kerry opposed Medicare reform and health savings accounts. After supporting my education reforms, he now wants to dilute them. He opposes legal and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing the marriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, opposed lowering income taxes for all who pay them. Audience members. Boo-o-o! The President. Wait a minute—wait a minute. To be fair, there are some things my opponent is for.  He's proposed more than $2 trillion in Federal spending so far, and that's a lot, even for a Senator from Massachusetts. And to pay for that spending, he's running on a platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician usually keeps.  His tax—his policies of tax and spend, of expanding Government rather than expanding opportunity, are the politics of the past. We are on the path to the future, and we're not turning back. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. In this world of change, some things do not change, the values we try to live by, the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment. Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform that strengthens family and requires work. Because a caring society will value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child. Because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our Government must never discriminate against them. Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges, and I will continue to appoint Federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law. My opponent recently announced that he is the conservative—the candidate of ""conservative values""—must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters.  There's some problems with this claim. If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid you are not the candidate of conservative values. If you voted against the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservative values. If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan Presidency 8 years of ""moral darkness,"" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative values is not one of them. This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism, and you know where I stand. Three days after September the 11th, I stood where Americans died, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hardhats were shouting to me, ""Whatever it takes."" A fellow grabbed me by the arm, and he said, ""Do not let me down."" Since that day, I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in defending America, whatever it takes. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. So we have fought the terrorists across the Earth—not for pride, not for power, but because the lives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is clear. We have tripled funding for homeland security and trained a half a million first-responders, because we are determined to protect our homeland. We are transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence services. We are staying on the offensive, striking terrorists abroad so we do not have to face them here at home. And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East, because freedom will bring a future of hope and the peace we all want. And we will prevail. Our strategy is succeeding. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of Al Qaida; Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups; Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terrorist fundraising; Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons; Iraq was a gathering threat; and Al Qaida was largely unchal
lenged as it planned attacks. Today, the Government of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror; Pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders; Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests; Libya is dismantling its weapons programs; the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom; and more than three-quarters of Al Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed. We have led; many have joined; and America and the world are safer. This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions. And the toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support for terror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even using weapons of mass destruction. And we know that September the 11th requires our country to think differently. We must and we will confront threats to America before it is too late. In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his runningmate, saw the threat and voted to authorize the use of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm or face serious consequences. Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a decade of diplomacy, we gave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world. He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office, a decision no President would ask for but must be prepared to make: Do I forget the lessons of September the 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time. Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy is coming to the broader Middle East. In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people, yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the October Presidential election, a resounding endorsement for democracy. Despite ongoing acts of violence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections are scheduled for January. Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, because when America gives its word, America must keep its word. As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer. Free societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export. Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of harboring them, and that helps us keep the peace. So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies and move toward elections and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible. And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned. Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army specialist wrote home: ""We are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place."" ""The various terrorist enemies we are facing in Iraq,"" he continued, ""are really aiming at you back in the United States. This is a test of will for our country. We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories and confronting the evil terrorists."" That young man is right. Our men and women in uniform are doing a superb job for America. Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: You are involved in a struggle of historic proportion. Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terrorists where they live and plan, and you're making America safer. Because of you, women in Afghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer fear being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more just and will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We will give you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory. Again, my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed and the Congress overwhelmingly passed $87 billion in funding needed by our troops doing battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his runningmate voted against this money for bullets and fuel and vehicles and body armor. When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it."" Then he said he was proud of that vote. Then, when pressed, he said it was a complicated matter. There's nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat. Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations stand beside us in Afghanistan and some 30 in Iraq. I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaders like Prime Minister Howard, President Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Berlusconi, and, of course, Prime Minister Tony Blair. Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has called American allies, quote, ""a coalition of the coerced and the bribed."" That would be nations like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others, allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician. I respect every soldier from every country who serves beside us in the hard work of history. America is grateful, and America will not forget. The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see me in the Oval Office. They had X's branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had been cut off by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes. During our emotional visit, one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write out, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America. I am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed and the greatest force for good on this Earth. Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. They know that a vibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radical ideology of hate. They know that men and women with hope and purpose and dignity do not strap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent. The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear. And they should be afraid, because freedom is on the march. I believe in the transformational power of liberty. The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their example will send a message of hope throughout a vital region. Palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel. Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality and justice is coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are found in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers and political prisoners and exiles will hear the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever. And as freedom advances, heart by heart and nation by nation, America will be more secure and the world more peaceful. America has done this kind of work before, and there have always been doubters. In 1946, 18 months after the fall of Berlin to Allied forces, a journalist in the New York Times wrote this: ""Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic, political, and moral crisis. European capitals are frightened. In every military headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed."" End quote. Maybe that same person is still around, writing editorials. Fortunately, we had a resolute President named Truman who, with the American people, persevered, knowing that a new democracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace. And because that generation of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer world today. The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not come easily or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of liberty to transform lives and nations. That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sin of slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We were honored to aid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan and Nicaragua and Central Europe and the Baltics, and that noble story goes on. I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century. I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty. I believe that given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of government ever devised by man. I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift to the world; it is the Almighty God's gift to every man and woman in this world. This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will know if we kept our faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized this moment and used it to build a future of safety and peace. The freedom of many and the future security of our Nation now depend on us. And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me. In the last 4 years, you and I have come to know each other. Even when we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand. You may have noticed I have a few flaws too. People sometimes have to correct my English.  I knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it.  Some folks look at me and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called walking.  Now and then I come across as a little too blunt, and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there.  One thing I have learned about the Presidency is that whatever shortcomings you have, people are going to notice them— —and whatever strengths you have, you're going to need them. These 4 years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget. I've tried to comfort Americans who lost the most on September the 11th, people who showed me a picture or told me a story so I would know how much was taken from them. I've learned firsthand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it is right. I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead, who say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who are told their dad or mom is a hero but would rather just have their mom or dad. I've met with the parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded flag and said a final goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many have used those meetings to say that I'm in their prayers and to offer encouragement to me. Where does that—strength like that come from? How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It is because they know their loved one was last seen doing good, because they know that liberty was precious to the one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character of a great nation, decent, idealistic, and strong. The world saw that spirit 3 miles from here when the people of this city faced peril together and lifted a flag over the ruins and defied the enemy with their courage. My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, people will look to the resurrection of New York City and they will say, ""Here buildings fell. Here a nation rose."" We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one. We see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of worry. We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again. We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy with their effort and optimism. And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt: Having come this far, our tested and confident Nation can achieve anything. To everything we know there is a season, a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time for rebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope. This young century will be liberty's century. By promoting liberty abroad, we will build a safer world. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America. Like generations before us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is the everlasting dream of America, and tonight, in this place, that dream is renewed. Now we go forward, grateful for our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the future of the greatest nation on Earth. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless our great country. Thank you all.
",remarks-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-republican-national-convention-new-york.txt,33,thank you all mr chairman delegates fellow citizens i am honored by your support and i accept your nomination for president of the united states when i said those words 4 years ago none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring in the heart of this great city we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet morning we saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger we learned of passengers on a doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers we have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet and we have seen americans in uniform storming mountain strongholds and charging through sandstorms and liberating millions with acts of valor that would make the men of normandy proud since 2001 americans have been given hills to climb and found the strength to climb them now because we have made the hard journey we can see the valley below now because we have faced challenges with resolve we have historic goals within our reach and greatness in our future we will build a safer world and a more hopeful america and nothing will hold us back in the work we have done and the work we will do i am fortunate to have a superb vice president i have counted on dick cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days and i am honored to have him at my side i am grateful to share my walk in life with laura bush americans have come to see the goodness and kindness and strength i first saw 26 years ago and we love our first lady i'm a fortunate father of two spirited intelligent and lovely young women i'm blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends and i will always be the proud and grateful son of george and barbara bush my father served 8 years at the side of another great american ronald reagan his spirit of optimism and good will and decency are in this hall and are in our hearts and will always define our party two months from today voters will make a choice based on the records we have built the convictions we hold and the vision that guides us forward a presidential election is a contest for the future tonight i will tell you where i stand what i believe and where i will lead this country in the next 4 years i believe every child can learn and every school must teach so we passed the most important federal education reform in history because we acted children are making sustained progress in reading and math america's schools are getting better and nothing will hold us back i believe we have a moral responsibility to honor america's seniors so i brought republicans and democrats together to strengthen medicare now seniors are getting immediate help buying medicine soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage and nothing will hold us back i believe in the energy and innovative spirit of america's workers entrepreneurs farmers and ranchers so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation because we acted our economy is growing again and creating jobs and nothing will hold us back i believe the most solemn duty of the american president is to protect the american people if america shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade the world will drift toward tragedy this will not happen on my watch i'm running for president with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world and a more hopeful america i'm running with a compassionate conservative philosophy that government should help people improve their lives not try to run their lives i believe this nation wants steady consistent principled leadership and that is why with your help we will win this election audience members four more years four more years four more years the president the story of america is the story of expanding liberty an ever widening circle constantly growing to reach further and include more our nation's founding commitment is still our deepest commitment in our world and here at home we will extend the frontiers of freedom the times in which we work and live are changing dramatically the workers of our parents' generation typically had one job one skill one career often with one company that provided health care and a pension and most of those workers were men today workers change jobs even careers many times during their lives and in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen two thirds of all moms also work outside the home this changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all americans to earn a better living support your family and have a rewarding career and government must take your side many of our most fundamental systems the tax code health coverage pension plans worker training were created for the world of yesterday not tomorrow we will transform these systems so that all citizens are equipped prepared'and thus truly free'to make your own choices and pursue your own dreams my plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy we now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods but new competition for our workers to create more jobs in america america must be the best place in the world to do business to create jobs my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining federal spending reducing regulation and making the tax relief permanent to create jobs we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy to create jobs we will expand trade and level the playing field to sell american goods and services across the globe and we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolous lawsuits that threaten jobs across our country another drag on our economy is the current tax code which is a complicated mess filled with special interest loopholes saddling our people with more than 6 billion hours of paperwork and headache every year the american people deserve'and our economic future demands'a simpler fairer progrowth system in a new term i will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expanding economy to find better and higher paying jobs in this time of change many workers want to go back to school to learn different or higher level skills so we will double the number of people served by our principal job training program and increase funding for our community colleges i know that with the right skills american workers can compete with anyone anywhere in the world in this time of change opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others to stand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing textile and other jobs we will create american opportunity zones in these areas we will provide tax relief and other incentives to attract new business and improve housing and job training to bring hope and work throughout all of america as i've traveled the country i've met many workers and small business owners who have told me that they are worried they cannot afford health care more than half of the uninsured are small business employees and their families in a new term we must allow small firms to join together to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies we will offer a tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts and provide direct help for low income americans to purchase them these accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness the opportunity to save tax free for routine health expenses and the freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you change jobs we will provide low income americans with better access to health care in a new term i will ensure every poor county in america has a community or rural health center as i have traveled our country i have met too many good doctors especially ob gyns who are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits to make health care more affordable and accessible we must pass medical liability reform now and in all we do to improve health care in america we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients not by bureaucrats in washington dc in this time of change government must take the side of working families in a new term we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp time and flex time our laws should never stand in the way of a more family friendly workplace another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society because ownership brings security and dignity and independence thanks to our policies homeownership in america is at an alltime high tonight we set a new goal 7 million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more american families will be able to open the door and say welcome to my home in an ownership society more people will own their health care plans and have the confidence of owning a piece of their retirement we'll always keep the promise of social security for our older workers with the huge baby boom generation approaching retirement many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether social security will be there when they need it we must strengthen social security by allowing younger workers to save some of their taxes in a personal account a nest egg you can call your own and government can never take away in all these proposals we seek to provide not just a government program but a path a path to greater opportunity more freedom and more control over your own life and the path begins with our youngest americans to build a more hopeful america we must help our children reach as far as their vision and character can take them tonight i remind every parent and every teacher i say to every child no matter what your circumstance no matter where you live your school will be the path to promise of america we are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results we are insisting on accountability empowering parents and teachers and making sure that local people are in charge of their schools by testing every child we are identifying those who need help and we are providing a record level of funding to get them that help in northeast georgia gainesville elementary school is mostly hispanic and 90 percent poor and this year 90 percent of the students passed state tests in reading and math the principal expresses the philosophy of his school this way we don't focus on what we can't do at this school we focus on what we can do and we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finish line see this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations and that is the spirit of our education reform and the commitment of our country no dejaremos a ningun nino atras we will leave no child behind audience members viva bush viva bush viva bush we are making progress'we are making progress and there is more to do in this time of change most new jobs are filled by people with at least 2 years of college yet only about one in four students gets there in our high schools we will fund early intervention programs to help students at risk we will place a new focus on math and science as we make progress we will require a rigorous exam before graduation by raising performance in our high schools and expanding pell grants for low and middle income families we will help more americans start their career with a college diploma america's children must also have a healthy start in life in a new term we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs we will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online the web address is not very imaginative but it's easy to remember georgewbush com these changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity and here you face a choice my opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours senator kerry opposed medicare reform and health savings accounts after supporting my education reforms he now wants to dilute them he opposes legal and medical liability reform he opposed reducing the marriage penalty opposed doubling the child credit opposed lowering income taxes for all who pay them audience members boo o o the president wait a minute'wait a minute to be fair there are some things my opponent is for he's proposed more than 2 trillion in federal spending so far and that's a lot even for a senator from massachusetts and to pay for that spending he's running on a platform of increasing taxes and that's the kind of promise a politician usually keeps his tax'his policies of tax and spend of expanding government rather than expanding opportunity are the politics of the past we are on the path to the future and we're not turning back audience members four more years four more years four more years the president in this world of change some things do not change the values we try to live by the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment because family and work are sources of stability and dignity i support welfare reform that strengthens family and requires work because a caring society will value its weakest members we must make a place for the unborn child because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion our government must never discriminate against them because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society i support the protection of marriage against activist judges and i will continue to appoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law my opponent recently announced that he is the conservative'the candidate of conservative values 'must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters there's some problems with this claim if you say the heart and soul of america is found in hollywood i'm afraid you are not the candidate of conservative values if you voted against the bipartisan defense of marriage act which president clinton signed you are not the candidate of conservative values if you gave a speech as my opponent did calling the reagan presidency 8 years of moral darkness then you may be a lot of things but the candidate of conservative values is not one of them this election will also determine how america responds to the continuing danger of terrorism and you know where i stand three days after september the 11th i stood where americans died in the ruins of the twin towers workers in hardhats were shouting to me whatever it takes a fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said do not let me down since that day i wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country i will never relent in defending america whatever it takes audience members u s a u s a u s a the president so we have fought the terrorists across the earth'not for pride not for power but because the lives of our citizens are at stake our strategy is clear we have tripled funding for homeland security and trained a half a million first responders because we are determined to protect our homeland we are transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence services we are staying on the offensive striking terrorists abroad so we do not have to face them here at home and we are working to advance liberty in the broader middle east because freedom will bring a future of hope and the peace we all want and we will prevail our strategy is succeeding audience members four more years four more years four more years the president four years ago afghanistan was the home base of al qaida pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups saudi arabia was fertile ground for terrorist fundraising libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons iraq was a gathering threat and al qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks today the government of a free afghanistan is fighting terror pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders saudi arabia is making raids and arrests libya is dismantling its weapons programs the army of a free iraq is fighting for freedom and more than three quarters of al qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed we have led many have joined and america and the world are safer this progress involved careful diplomacy clear moral purpose and some tough decisions and the toughest came on iraq we knew saddam hussein's record of aggression and support for terror we knew his long history of pursuing even using weapons of mass destruction and we know that september the 11th requires our country to think differently we must and we will confront threats to america before it is too late in saddam hussein we saw a threat members of both political parties including members of both political parties including my opponent and his runningmate saw the threat and voted to authorize the use of force we went to the united nations security council which passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm or face serious consequences leaders in the middle east urged him to comply after more than a decade of diplomacy we gave saddam hussein another chance a final chance to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world he again refused and i faced the kind of decision that comes only to the oval office a decision no president would ask for but must be prepared to make do i forget the lessons of september the 11th and take the word of a madman or do i take action to defend our country faced with that choice i will defend america every time because we acted to defend our country the murderous regimes of saddam hussein and the taliban are history more than 50 million people have been liberated and democracy is coming to the broader middle east in afghanistan terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the october presidential election a resounding endorsement for democracy despite ongoing acts of violence iraq now has a strong prime minister a national council and national elections are scheduled for january our nation is standing with the people of afghanistan and iraq because when america gives its word america must keep its word as importantly we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer free societies in the middle east will be hopeful societies which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export free governments in the middle east will fight terrorists instead of harboring them and that helps us keep the peace so our mission in afghanistan and iraq is clear we will help new leaders to train their armies and move toward elections and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible and then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned our troops know the historic importance of our work one army specialist wrote home we are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place the various terrorist enemies we are facing in iraq he continued are really aiming at you back in the united states this is a test of will for our country we soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories and confronting the evil terrorists that young man is right our men and women in uniform are doing a superb job for america tonight i want to speak to all of them and to their families you are involved in a struggle of historic proportion because of your service and sacrifice we are defeating the terrorists where they live and plan and you're making america safer because of you women in afghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium because of you the people of iraq no longer fear being executed and left in mass graves because of you the world is more just and will be more peaceful we owe you our thanks and we owe you something more we will give you all the resources all the tools and all the support you need for victory again my opponent and i have different approaches i proposed and the congress overwhelmingly passed 87 billion in funding needed by our troops doing battle in afghanistan and iraq my opponent and his runningmate voted against this money for bullets and fuel and vehicles and body armor when asked to explain his vote the senator said i actually did vote for the 87 billion before i voted against it then he said he was proud of that vote then when pressed he said it was a complicated matter there's nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat our allies also know the historic importance of our work about 40 nations stand beside us in afghanistan and some 30 in iraq i deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaders like prime minister howard president kwasniewski prime minister berlusconi and of course prime minister tony blair again my opponent takes a different approach in the midst of war he has called american allies quote a coalition of the coerced and the bribed that would be nations like great britain poland italy japan the netherlands denmark el salvador australia and others allies that deserve the respect of all americans not the scorn of a politician i respect every soldier from every country who serves beside us in the hard work of history america is grateful and america will not forget the people we have freed won't forget either not long ago seven iraqi men came to see me in the oval office they had x's branded into their foreheads and their right hands had been cut off by saddam hussein's secret police the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes during our emotional visit one of the iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write out in arabic a prayer for god to bless america i am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed and the greatest force for good on this earth others understand the historic importance of our work the terrorists know they know that a vibrant successful democracy at the heart of the middle east will discredit their radical ideology of hate they know that men and women with hope and purpose and dignity do not strap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent the terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear and they should be afraid because freedom is on the march i believe in the transformational power of liberty the wisest use of american strength is to advance freedom as the citizens of afghanistan and iraq seize the moment their example will send a message of hope throughout a vital region palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their reach and so is peace with our good friend israel young women across the middle east will hear the message that their day of equality and justice is coming young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are found in liberty not tyranny and terror reformers and political prisoners and exiles will hear the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever and as freedom advances heart by heart and nation by nation america will be more secure and the world more peaceful america has done this kind of work before and there have always been doubters in 1946 18 months after the fall of berlin to allied forces a journalist in the new york times wrote this germany is a land in an acute stage of economic political and moral crisis european capitals are frightened in every military headquarters one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed end quote maybe that same person is still around writing editorials fortunately we had a resolute president named truman who with the american people persevered knowing that a new democracy at the center of europe would lead to stability and peace and because that generation of americans held firm in the cause of liberty we live in a better and safer world today the progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader middle east will not come easily or all at once yet americans of all people should never be surprised by the power of liberty to transform lives and nations that power brought settlers on perilous journeys inspired colonies to rebellion ended the sin of slavery and set our nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century we were honored to aid the rise of democracy in germany and japan and nicaragua and central europe and the baltics and that noble story goes on i believe that america is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century i believe that millions in the middle east plead in silence for their liberty i believe that given the chance they will embrace the most honorable form of government ever devised by man i believe all these things because freedom is not america's gift to the world it is the almighty god's gift to every man and woman in this world this moment in the life of our country will be remembered generations will know if we kept our faith and kept our word generations will know if we seized this moment and used it to build a future of safety and peace the freedom of many and the future security of our nation now depend on us and tonight my fellow americans i ask you to stand with me in the last 4 years you and i have come to know each other even when we don't agree at least you know what i believe and where i stand you may have noticed i have a few flaws too people sometimes have to correct my english i knew i had a problem when arnold schwarzenegger started doing it some folks look at me and see a certain swagger which in texas is called walking now and then i come across as a little too blunt and for that we can all thank the white haired lady sitting right up there one thing i have learned about the presidency is that whatever shortcomings you have people are going to notice them''and whatever strengths you have you're going to need them these 4 years have brought moments i could not foresee and will not forget

that come from how can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride it is because they know their loved one was last seen doing good because they know that liberty was precious to the one they lost and in those military families i have seen the character of a great nation decent idealistic and strong the world saw that spirit 3 miles from here when the people of this city faced peril together and lifted a flag over the ruins and defied the enemy with their courage my fellow americans for as long as our country stands people will look to the resurrection of new york city and they will say here buildings fell here a nation rose we see america's character in our military which finds a way or makes one we see it in our veterans who are supporting military families in their days

honored by your support, and I accept your nomination for President of the United States.', 'When I said those words 4 years ago, none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring.', 'In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet morning.', 'We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger.', 'We learned of passengers on a doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers.', 'We have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet.', 'And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountain strongholds and charging through sandstorms and liberating millions with acts of valor that would make the men of Normandy proud.', 'Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb and found the strength to climb them.', 'Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below.', 'Now, because we have faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach and greatness in our future.', 'We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America, and nothing will hold us back.', 'In the work we have done and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb Vice President.', ""I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, and I am honored to have him at my side."", 'I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush.', 'Americans have come to see the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our First Lady.', ""I'm a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women."", ""I'm blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends."", 'And I will always be the proud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush.', 'My father served 8 years at the side of another great American, Ronald Reagan.', 'His spirit of optimism and good will and decency are in this hall and are in our hearts and will always define our party.', 'Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, the convictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward.', 'A Presidential election is a contest for the future.', 'Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead this country in the next 4 years.', 'I believe every child can learn and every school must teach, so we passed the most important Federal education reform in history.', ""Because we acted, children are making sustained progress in reading and math; America's schools are getting better; and nothing will hold us back."", ""I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors, so I brought Republicans and Democrats together to strengthen Medicare."", 'Now seniors are getting immediate help buying medicine; soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage; and nothing will hold us back.', ""I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and ranchers, so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation."", 'Because we acted, our economy is growing again and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back.', 'I believe the most solemn duty of the American President is to protect the American people.', 'If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.', 'This will not happen on my watch.', ""I'm running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world and a more hopeful America."", ""I'm running with a compassionate conservative philosophy, that government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives."", 'I believe this Nation wants steady, consistent, principled leadership, and that is why, with your help, we will win this election.', 'Audience members.', 'Four more years!', 'Four more years!', 'Four more years!', 'The President.', 'The story of America is the story of expanding liberty, an ever-widening circle, constantly growing to reach further and include more.', ""Our Nation's founding commitment is still our deepest commitment: In our world and here at home, we will extend the frontiers of freedom."", 'The times in which we work and live are changing dramatically.', ""The workers of our parents' generation typically had one job, one skill, one career, often with one company that provided health care and a pension."", 'And most of those workers were men.', 'Today, workers change jobs, even careers, many times during their lives.', 'And in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen, two-thirds of all moms also work outside the home.', 'This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a better living, support your family, and have a rewarding career.', 'And Government must take your side.', 'Many of our most fundamental systems, the Tax Code, health coverage, pension plans, worker training, were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow.', 'We will transform these systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared—and thus truly free—to make your own choices and pursue your own dreams.', 'My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy.', 'We now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods but new competition for our workers.', 'To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world to do business.', 'To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining Federal spending, reducing regulation, and making the tax relief permanent.', 'To create jobs, we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy.', 'To create jobs, we will expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe.', 'And we must protect small-business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolous lawsuits that threaten jobs across our country.', 'Another drag on our economy is the current Tax Code, which is a complicated mess, filled with special interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than 6 billion hours of paperwork and headache every year.', 'The American people deserve— and our economic future demands—a simpler, fairer, progrowth system.', 'In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the Federal Tax Code.', 'Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expanding economy to find better and higher paying jobs.', 'In this time of change, many workers want to go back to school to learn different or higher level skills.', 'So we will double the number of people served by our principal job training program and increase funding for our community colleges.', 'I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone, anywhere in the world.', 'In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others.', 'To stand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, and other jobs, we will create American opportunity zones.', 'In these areas, we will provide tax relief and other incentives to attract new business and improve housing and job training to bring hope and work throughout all of America.', ""As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small-business owners who have told me that they are worried they cannot afford health care."", 'More than half of the uninsured are small-business employees and their families.', 'In a new term, we must allow small firms to join together to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies.', 'We will offer a tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them.', 'These accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to save tax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you change jobs.', 'We will provide low-income Americans with better access to health care.', 'In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community or rural health center.', 'As I have traveled our country, I have met too many good doctors, especially ob-gyns, who are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits.', 'To make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now.', 'And in all we do to improve health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC.', 'In this time of change, Government must take the side of working families.', 'In a new term, we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time.', 'Our laws should never stand in the way of a more family-friendly workplace.', 'Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership brings security and dignity and independence.', 'Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America is at an alltime high.', 'Tonight we set a new goal: 7 million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say, ""Welcome to my home.""', 'In an ownership society, more people will own their health care plans and have the confidence of owning a piece of their retirement.', ""We'll always keep the promise of Social Security for our older workers."", 'With the huge baby boom generation approaching retirement, many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will be there when they need it.', 'We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to save some of their taxes in a personal account, a nest egg you can call your own and Government can never take away.', 'In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a Government program but a path, a path to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life.', 'And the path begins with our youngest Americans.', 'To build a more hopeful America, we must help our children reach as far as their vision and character can take them.', 'Tonight I remind every parent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matter where you live, your school will be the path to promise of America.', 'We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results.', 'We are insisting on accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are in charge of their schools.', 'By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help, and we are providing a record level of funding to get them that help.', 'In northeast Georgia, Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor, and this year 90 percent of the students passed State tests in reading and math.', 'The principal expresses the philosophy of his school this way: ""We don\'t focus on what we can\'t do at this school.', 'We focus on what we can do, and we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finish line.""', 'See, this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations.', 'And that is the spirit of our education reform and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ningun nino atras.', 'We will leave no child behind.', 'Audience members.', 'Viva Bush!', 'Viva Bush!', 'Viva Bush!', 'We are making progress—we are making progress, and there is more to do.', 'In this time of change, most new jobs are filled by people with at least 2 years of college, yet only about one in four students gets there.', 'In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to help students at risk.', 'We will place a new focus on math and science.', 'As we make progress, we will require a rigorous exam before graduation.', 'By raising performance in our high schools and expanding Pell grants for low- and middle-income families, we will help more Americans start their career with a college diploma.', ""America's children must also have a healthy start in life."", ""In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the Government's health insurance programs."", 'We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need.', 'Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online.', ""The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember: georgewbush.com."", 'These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity.', 'And here, you face a choice.', ""My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours."", 'Senator Kerry opposed Medicare reform and health savings accounts.', 'After supporting my education reforms, he now wants to dilute them.', 'He opposes legal and medical liability reform.', 'He opposed reducing the marriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, opposed lowering income taxes for all who pay them.', 'Audience members.', 'Boo-o-o!', 'The President.', 'Wait a minute—wait a minute.', 'To be fair, there are some things my opponent is for.', ""He's proposed more than $2 trillion in Federal spending so far, and that's a lot, even for a Senator from Massachusetts."", ""And to pay for that spending, he's running on a platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician usually keeps."", 'His tax—his policies of tax and spend, of expanding Government rather than expanding opportunity, are the politics of the past.', ""We are on the path to the future, and we're not turning back."", 'Audience members.', 'Four more years!', 'Four more years!', 'Four more years!', 'The President.', 'In this world of change, some things do not change, the values we try to live by, the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose.', 'Our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment.', 'Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform that strengthens family and requires work.', 'Because a caring society will value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child.', 'Because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our Government must never discriminate against them.', 'Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges, and I will continue to appoint Federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law.', 'My opponent recently announced that he is the conservative—the candidate of ""conservative values""—must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters.', ""There's some problems with this claim."", ""If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid you are not the candidate of conservative values."", 'If you voted against the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservative values.', 'If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan Presidency 8 years of ""moral darkness,"" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative values is not one of them.', 'This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism, and you know where I stand.', 'Three days after September the 11th, I stood where Americans died, in the ruins of the Twin Towers.', 'Workers in hardhats were shouting to me, ""Whatever it takes.""', 'A fellow grabbed me by the arm, and he said, ""Do not let me down.""', 'Since that day, I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country.', 'I will never relent in defending America, whatever it takes.', 'Audience members.', 'U.S.A.!', 'U.S.A.!', 'U.S.A.!', 'The President.', 'So we have fought the terrorists across the Earth—not for pride, not for power, but because the lives of our citizens are at stake.', 'Our strategy is clear.', 'We have tripled funding for homeland security and trained a half a million first-responders, because we are determined to protect our homeland.', 'We are transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence services.', 'We are staying on the offensive, striking terrorists abroad so we do not have to face them here at home.', 'And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East, because freedom will bring a future of hope and the peace we all want.', 'And we will prevail.', 'Our strategy is succeeding.', 'Audience members.', 'Four more years!', 'Four more years!', 'Four more years!', 'The President.', 'Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of Al Qaida; Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups; Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terrorist fundraising; Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons; Iraq was a gathering threat; and Al Qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks.', ""Today, the Government of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror; Pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders; Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests; Libya is dismantling its weapons programs; the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom; and more than three-quarters of Al Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed."", 'We have led; many have joined; and America and the world are safer.', 'This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions.', 'And the toughest came on Iraq.', ""We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support for terror."", 'We knew his long history of pursuing, even using weapons of mass destruction.', 'And we know that September the 11th requires our country to think differently.', 'We must and we will confront threats to America before it is too late.', 'In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat.', 'Members of both political parties, including Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his runningmate, saw the threat and voted to authorize the use of force.', 'We went to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm or face serious consequences.', 'Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply.', 'After more than a decade of diplomacy, we gave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world.', 'He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office, a decision no President would ask for but must be prepared to make: Do I forget the lessons of September the 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country?', 'Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.', 'Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy is coming to the broader Middle East.', 'In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people, yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the October Presidential election, a resounding endorsement for democracy.', 'Despite ongoing acts of violence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections are scheduled for January.', 'Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, because when America gives its word, America must keep its word.', 'As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer.', 'Free societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export.', 'Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of harboring them, and that helps us keep the peace.', 'So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies and move toward elections and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible.', 'And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned.', 'Our troops know the historic importance of our work.', 'One Army specialist wrote home: ""We are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place.""', '""The various terrorist enemies we are facing in Iraq,"" he continued, ""are really aiming at you back in the United States.', 'This is a test of will for our country.', 'We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories and confronting the evil terrorists.""', 'That young man is right.', 'Our men and women in uniform are doing a superb job for America.', 'Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: You are involved in a struggle of historic proportion.', ""Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terrorists where they live and plan, and you're making America safer."", 'Because of you, women in Afghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium.', 'Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer fear being executed and left in mass graves.', 'Because of you, the world is more just and will be more peaceful.', 'We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more.', 'We will give you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory.', 'Again, my opponent and I have different approaches.', 'I proposed and the Congress overwhelmingly passed $87 billion in funding needed by our troops doing battle in Afghanistan and Iraq.', 'My opponent and his runningmate voted against this money for bullets and fuel and vehicles and body armor.', 'When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it.""', 'Then he said he was proud of that vote.', 'Then, when pressed, he said it was a complicated matter.', ""There's nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat."", 'Our allies also know the historic importance of our work.', 'About 40 nations stand beside us in Afghanistan and some 30 in Iraq.', 'I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaders like Prime Minister Howard, President Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Berlusconi, and, of course, Prime Minister Tony Blair.', 'Again, my opponent takes a different approach.', 'In the midst of war, he has called American allies, quote, ""a coalition of the coerced and the bribed.""', 'That would be nations like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others, allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician.', 'I respect every soldier from every country who serves beside us in the hard work of history.', 'America is grateful, and America will not forget.', ""The people we have freed won't forget either."", 'Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see me in the Oval Office.', ""They had X's branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had been cut off by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes."", 'During our emotional visit, one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write out, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America.', 'I am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed and the greatest force for good on this Earth.', 'Others understand the historic importance of our work.', 'The terrorists know.', 'They know that a vibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radical ideology of hate.', 'They know that men and women with hope and purpose and dignity do not strap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent.', 'The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear.', 'And they should be afraid, because freedom is on the march.', 'I believe in the transformational power of liberty.', 'The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom.', 'As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their example will send a message of hope throughout a vital region.', 'Palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel.', 'Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality and justice is coming.', 'Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are found in liberty, not tyranny and terror.', 'Reformers and political prisoners and exiles will hear the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever.', 'And as freedom advances, heart by heart and nation by nation, America will be more secure and the world more peaceful.', 'America has done this kind of work before, and there have always been doubters.', 'In 1946, 18 months after the fall of Berlin to Allied forces, a journalist in the New York Times wrote this: ""Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic, political, and moral crisis.', 'European capitals are frightened.', 'In every military headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed.""', 'End quote.', 'Maybe that same person is still around, writing editorials.', 'Fortunately, we had a resolute President named Truman who, with the American people, persevered, knowing that a new democracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace.', 'And because that generation of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer world today.', 'The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not come easily or all at once.', 'Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of liberty to transform lives and nations.', 'That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sin of slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century.', 'We were honored to aid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan and Nicaragua and Central Europe and the Baltics, and that noble story goes on.', 'I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century.', 'I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty.', 'I believe that

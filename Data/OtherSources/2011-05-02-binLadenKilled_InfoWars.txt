According to ABC News, the U.S. discovered a plot to kill Obama in the million or so pages supposedly taken from Osama’s mansion in Pakistan.

“U.S. officials are analyzing one million pages of data from the trove found in Osama bin Laden’s compound during the raid that killed him, and say they have learned more in the past ten days than in the past 10 years,” ABC claims.

In order to portray the terror group named after a Mujahideen database as ruthless, the U.S. also claims al-Qaeda wants to murder Obama’s 88 year old Kenyan step-grandmother, Sarah Obama.

“There is no doubt that when it comes to the American people,” said Obama, “that after having killed bin Laden there may be a desire on some al Qaeda members to exact revenge and that’s something that we have to be vigilant about and we’re monitoring all these situations.”

Obama and the government have yet to provide evidence they assassinated Osama bin Laden. Like the claim by the government that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction – a claim that later turned out to be cynical war propaganda with no basis in fact – the assertion that Navy SEALs and the CIA targeted and killed the al-Qaeda leader who died in late 2001 has no basis in fact.

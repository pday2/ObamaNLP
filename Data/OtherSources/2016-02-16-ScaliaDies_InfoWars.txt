Late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died during a meeting of an Austrian secret society founded by the Bohemian Grove as a feeder group for the real Illuminati – and the resort hosting the society is filled with esoteric artwork.

During a visit to Cibolo Creek Ranch in Presidio Co., Texas, Scalia died among members of the U.S. chapter of the International Order of St. Hubertus, which was launched in 1966 by associates of the Bohemian Grove which itself was a spin-off of the Order of the Bavarian Illuminati founded in 1776 to counter both the American revolution and the emerging populist movements in Europe.

“The Bavarian Illuminati’s own documents were intercepted by police many times – that’s why Encyclopedia Britannica breaks all this down – and they revealed the Illuminati was planned to take over the renaissance and the big, burgeoning liberty movement taking place in Europe and what became the United States,” Alex Jones revealed, who was the first to successfully infiltrate and film the Bohemian Grove. “So they founded the Bavarian Illuminati that later created the Jacobins of the French Revolution to not create revolutions to overthrow the corrupt monarchies and the church but to actually remove them and set themselves up as absolute rulers.”

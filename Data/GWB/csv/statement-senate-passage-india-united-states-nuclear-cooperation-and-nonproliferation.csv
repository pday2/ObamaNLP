"I congratulate the Senate on passing the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act, H.R. 7081. In particular, I commend the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for their leadership in crafting this important bipartisan legislation. I also thank Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell for bringing this bill to a vote prior to the Senate's adjournment. This legislation will strengthen our global nuclear nonproliferation efforts, protect the environment, create jobs, and assist India in meeting its growing energy needs in a responsible manner."
I look forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to strengthen the U.S.India strategic partnership.

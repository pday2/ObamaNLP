Today the President signed a proclamation granting permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) status to the People's Republic of China and terminating application of Jackson-Vanik provisions to China. Taking effect January 1, 2002, this is the final step in normalizing U.S.-China trade relations and welcoming China into a global, rules-based trading system. It marks the completion of more than a decade of bilateral and multilateral negotiations, and the beginning of a process of working constructively with China to help it fully implement its commitments on trade liberalization. Congress authorized these actions subject to the President's certification that the final terms of entry for China into the WTO were at least equivalent to those agreed to bilaterally between the United States and China in 1999, and China's successful entry into the WTO. The President certified the equivalency of the final terms on November 9, 2001; China formally became a WTO member on December 11, 2001.

Tonight is a particular honor for me because, letâs face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father -- my grandfather -- was a cook, a domestic servant to the British.

But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.

While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty; joined Pattonâs army, marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity.

And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter. A common dream, born of two continents.

My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or âblessed,â believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they werenât rich, because in a generous America you donât have to be rich to achieve your potential.

They're both passed away now. And yet, I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.

They stand here, and I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parentsâ dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible.

Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our Nation -- not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

That is the true genius of America, a faith -- a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles; that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm; that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door; that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe; that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted -- at least most of the time.

This year, in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of future generations.

And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, I say to you tonight: We have more work to do --  more work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant thatâs moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour; more to do for the father that I met who was losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he would pay 4500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on; more to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesnât have the money to go to college.

Now, donât get me wrong. The people I meet -- in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks -- they donât expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead,  and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they donât want their tax money wasted, by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go in -- Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone canât teach our kids to learn; they know that parents have to teach, that children canât achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.

People donât expect -- People don't expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all.

They know we can do better. And they want that choice.

In this election, we offer that choice. Our Party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. And that man is John Kerry.

John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because theyâve defined his life. From his heroic service to Vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he's devoted himself to this country. Again and again, weâve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available.

His values and his record affirm what is best in us. John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded; so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home.

John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves.

John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we arenât held hostage to the profits of oil companies, or the sabotage of foreign oil fields.

John Kerry believes in the Constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us.

And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option.

You know, a while back -- awhile back I met a young man named Shamus in a V.F.W. Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid -- six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easy smile. He told me heâd joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. And as I listened to him explain why heâd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.

But then I asked myself, ""Are we serving Shamus as well as he is serving us?""

I thought of the 900 men and women -- sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who wonât be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families Iâve met who were struggling to get by without a loved oneâs full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefits because they were Reservists.

When we send our young men and women into harmâs way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why theyâre going, to care for their families while theyâre gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.

Now -- Now let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.

John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that itâs not enough for just some of us to prosper -- for alongside our famous individualism, thereâs another ingredient in the American saga,  a belief that weâre all connected as one people. If there is a child on the south side of Chicago who canât read, that matters to me, even if itâs not my child. If there is a senior citizen somewhere who canât pay for their prescription drugs, and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if itâs not my grandparent. If thereâs an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties.

It is that fundamental belief -- It is that fundamental belief: I am my brotherâs keeper. I am my sisterâs keeper -- that makes this country work. Itâs what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family.

        E pluribus unum: ""Out of many, one.""

Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us -- the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of ""anything goes."" Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America -- thereâs the United States of America.

The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But Iâve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we donât like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and yes, weâve got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.

In the end -- In the end -- In the end, thatâs what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope?

John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope.

Iâm not talking about blind optimism here -- the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just donât think about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. Thatâs not what Iâm talking about. Iâm talking about something more substantial. Itâs the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworkerâs son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.

Hope -- Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope!

In the end, that is Godâs greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation. A belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead.

I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity.

I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair.

I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us.

America! Tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do -- if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as President, and John Edwards will be sworn in as Vice President, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.

Thank you very much everybody.

God bless you.

Thank you.
","John Kerry's decorated service in Vietnam took center stage last night as Democrats sought to bolster his candidacy by challenging President Bush's greatest strength.

The evening showcased his foreign-born wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, who wooed her audience with a self-deprecating joke about her outspokenness, a poetic description of what America means to immigrants and the world and a forceful embrace of her husband's policies on subjects from the environment to foreign affairs.

""John believes we can, and we must, lead the world, as America, unique among nations, always should, by showing the face, not of its fears, but of our hopes,"" she said.

Her husband ""is a fighter. He earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country,"" Mrs. Heinz Kerry said. His experience in Vietnam as a Navy lieutenant, including the friends lost, ""testified to the awful toll exacted by leaders who mistake stubbornness for strength.""

Earlier in the evening, Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy took a harsher tone, accusing the Bush administration of making the U.S. less safe by alienating allies and attacking Saddam Hussein. ""In these challenging times for our country, in these fateful times for the world, America needs a genuine uniter, not a divider who only claims to be a uniter,"" Mr. Kennedy said.

The senator and Mrs. Heinz Kerry delivered their addresses on a night in which Democratic strategists hoped to portray their presumed nominee to voters as a strong leader who could carry on the battle against terrorism. Although Mr. Bush's approval ratings have slipped recently, he continues to enjoy an advantage over Mr. Kerry for his handling of terrorism. In public-opinion polls, many voters say they still don't know very much about Mr. Kerry, despite his lengthy public career and millions of dollars in television commercials.

But organizers at the party's national convention were facing a tougher-than-expected job, as the FleetCenter here remained abuzz over the powerful performance offered Monday night by former President Bill Clinton, contrasting the policies of the Democratic and Republican parties.

And debate continued over the import of a televised clip of Mrs. Heinz Kerry earlier this week, in which she accused a conservative newspaper's reporter of misquoting her and, in final frustration, told him to ""shove it.""

It wasn't much help either that the major television networks decided not to air the second-night lineup of speakers, which included retiring Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt; Ron Reagan, the late president's son, who appealed for expanded stem-cell research, and newcomer Barack Obama, an Illinois lawyer favored to win a U.S. Senate seat.

Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who gave war opponents a strong voice in the Democratic primaries, received a roaring ovation. ""We're not going to let those who disagree with us to shout us down under a banner of false patriotism,"" he said.

In a veiled reference to Mr. Bush's lack of service in Vietnam, Mr. Obama said Mr. Kerry repeatedly has made ""tough choices when easier ones were available.""

As if mindful of the networks' ignoring the Boston activities yesterday, Mr. Kerry kept to the road, staging two visual spectacles aimed at television. At the prime-time news hour, he was host of a rally on the same Philadelphia Art Museum steps made famous in the movie ""Rocky.""

Earlier Mr. Kerry stood in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Va., with Elliott ""Skip"" Barker, a fellow Navy swift-boat commander in Vietnam. Mr. Barker spoke of the lessons they both learned in combat that taught Mr. Kerry to always measure war against the lives lost. ""John Kerry knows that question. It is part of his soul, and he will get that answer before he sends my grandchildren and your children to war,"" Mr. Barker said.

In his Norfolk remarks, Mr. Kerry pressed Mr. Bush to extend the life of the controversial 9/11 Commission to ensure its recommendations are carried out. Capitol Hill Republicans and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge have expressed reservations about some of them.","Barack Obama took the dais as the keynote speaker at the Democratic convention here on Tuesday and told a classic American story of immigration, hope, striving and opportunity. He did not speak of race or civil rights or a struggle for equality. He did not speak, as the Rev. Jesse Jackson did so passionately in 1996, of the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a black America still in despair.

Instead, Mr. Obama, a black state senator from Illinois who is running for the United States Senate, spoke of ""one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.""

He drew rousing applause, and tears in some cases, for lines like, ""There's not a liberal America and a conservative America. There's the United States of America.""

For some black delegates and elected officials, Mr. Obama's optimistic theme of one America -- for Arab-Americans and Latinos, red states and blue states -- was entirely appropriate. Many of his listeners here tonight said they could not help but feel pride that Mr. Obama could become the only black member of the Senate and the third since Reconstruction.

""I think he is going to be a star in the Democratic Party,"" said Frederick Young, a member of the Illinois delegation. ""I am proud, as a black man, to see him give a speech like the one he gave. It was inspirational.""

But for some an equally compelling feature is that Mr. Obama could help the Democrats win a majority in the Senate. And many black delegates are so eager to defeat President Bush and the Republicans this year that they have embraced the theme of unity and optimism imposed by Democratic leaders and put aside their intraparty struggles of the past.

""What you're seeing is a maturation of the African-American vote and presence in the party,"" said Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor in the Clinton administration and a senior adviser to Senator John Kerry. ""We're at the table and helping to shape the agenda as opposed to being on the outside trying to get in.""

Four years ago, the keynote speaker, Representative Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee, was also black. Mr. Ford, who gave a fairly innocuous speech, was overshadowed by Mr. Jackson and the party's black caucus, who pointedly questioned the commitment of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the vice-presidential nominee, to affirmative action and public education.

The message of Mr. Obama was quite different. The son of a black man who grew up in Kenya herding goats and a white woman from Kansas, he said his parents shared ""an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation.""

Mr. Obama, 42, went on to study at Columbia and was the first black president of The Harvard Law Review. He scored a stunning victory in the March Democratic primary in Illinois, facing six opponents and still winning 53 percent of the vote. His Republican opponent, under fire, dropped out and has not been replaced.

""I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story,"" he said.

Some in the audience said Mr. Obama, who is married and has two daughters, had immediately risen to star status in a party eager for one.

""His story symbolizes the country's opportunities,"" said Tom J. Troetti, a delegate from New York. ""Based on that speech, he now personifies this party's future.""

There is already greater-than-usual enthusiasm among black delegates here. Walter Johnson, 49, a postal worker from Visalia, Calif., said he was so energized to work for Mr. Kerry that he would try to drum up voter support when he returned home ""by walking the street, by knocking on doors, and by phone banking.""

""To those that I reach,"" Mr. Johnson said, ""I'm going to say, 'Hey, get your family members, get your friends. This is important.""'

Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, said that many blacks were motivated by the disputed vote in Florida in 2000.

""Black folks started campaigning against Bush right after the last election was stolen,"" Mr. Rangel said. ""You put out the word to the black man and say 'Don't forget Florida,' you are putting out the most powerful message that we can put out politically.""

Mr. Kerry chose Mr. Obama to deliver the keynote address long before Mr. Bush asked black voters last week to consider voting Republican.

Some said they were insulted by Mr. Bush's pitch.

""African-Americans are smart,"" said Mayor Douglas Palmer of Trenton, the president of the National Conference of Mayors. ""They realize that we have given the Republican Party a chance going all the way back to Abraham Lincoln.""

Some said the Democratic Party had achieved a level of equilibrium, where its message could speak to both its most loyal constituency and swing voters. As Mr. Obama himself said earlier to black delegates here, ""Democrats succeed when they reach out to other people but don't forget the base.""

He sought to do just that in his speech on Tuesday, as he addressed ""Democrats, Republicans, Independents"" and talked about jobs, the high cost of health care and college tuition, the needs of veterans, and the imperative to ""never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war.""

David Bositis, a research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, said Democrats were in agreement on issues, and as such should focus on getting blacks to the polls. Mr. Bositis noted that blacks made up a significant percentage of the vote in several of the contested states, including Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Stephanie Cutter, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, said, ""By conducting this type of convention the way we have and by striving for a convention that reflects America, we're showing that we aren't taking anything for granted.""",2004-07-28,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.984, NEU: 0.014, NEG: 0.002})",0.9842914342880249,0.013739521615207195,0.0019690634217113256,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.679, NEU: 0.318, NEG: 0.003})","AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.538, NEU: 0.451, NEG: 0.011})",0.6786264777183533,0.3183305859565735,0.003042923053726554,0.5376733541488647,0.4511603116989136,0.011166267096996307
1,1,2008-06-04-ObamaNomination.txt,"Thank you....Thank you. What a -- What a wonderful reception. Thank you, Saint Paul. Thank you, Minnesota.

Thank you, JoAnn Syverson, for the wonderful introduction.

Thank you, Michelle Obama and Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Thank you to my brothers and sisters. Thank you to -- Thank you to my staff. Thank you to our volunteers. Thank you to my political team. Thank you to our campaign manager, David Plouffe, who never gets any credit, but has built the best political organization in the country.

Thank you to my grandmother, who helped raise me, and is sitting in Hawaii somewhere right now because she can't travel, but who poured everything she had into me, and who helped to make me the man I am today. Tonight is for her.

Tonight, Minnesota, after 54 hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end. Sixteen -- Sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Thousands of miles have been traveled; millions of voices have been heard.

And because of what you said, because you decided that change must come to Washington, because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest, because -- because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears, but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another, a journey -- a journey that will bring a new and better day to America.

Because of you, tonight I can stand here and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for the President of the United States of America.

I want to -- I want to thank -- I want to thank -- I want to thank all those in Montana and South Dakota who stood up for change today. I want to thank every American who stood with us over the course of this campaign, through the good days and the bad, from the snows of Cedar Rapids to the sunshine of Sioux Falls.

And, tonight, I also want to thank the men and woman who took this journey with me as fellow candidates for President. You know, at this defining moment -- At this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our Party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for office. I have not just competed with them as rivals. Iâve learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better. They are leaders of this Party and leaders that America will turn to for years to come.

And that is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else: Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign. She has made history not -- not just because sheâs a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she is a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight. I congratulate her on her victory in South Dakota, and I congratulate her on the race that she has run throughout this contest.

Weâve certainly had our differences over the last 16 months. But as someone whoâs shared a stage with her many times, I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning -- even in the face of tough odds -- is exactly what sent her and Bill Clinton to sign up for their first campaign in Texas all those years ago, what sent her to work at the Childrenâs Defense Fund and made her fight for health care as first lady, what led her to the United States Senate and fueled her barrier-breaking campaign for the presidency: an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be.

And you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country -- and we will win that fight -- she will be central to that victory. When we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen. Our Party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.

There are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided. Well, I say that, because of this primary, there are millions of Americans who've cast their ballot for the very first time. There are -- There are Independents and Republicans who understand this election isnât just about a change of Party in Washington, but also about the need to change Washington. There are -- There are young people, and African-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans, and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation.

All of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply. But at the end of the day, we arenât the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard. You didnât do that -- You didnât do that because of me or Senator Clinton or anyone else. You did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, we cannot afford to keep doing what weâve been doing. We owe our children a better future. We owe our country a better future. And for all those who dream of that future tonight, I say: Let us begin the work together. Let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for America.

In just -- In just a few short months, the Republican Party will arrive in St. Paul with a very different agenda. They will -- They will come here to nominate John McCain, a man who has served this country heroically. I honor, we honor the service of John McCain, and I respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny mine. My -- My differences with him -- My differences with him are not personal. They are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign, because while John McCain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his Party in the past, such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign.

Itâs not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year.

Itâs not change when he offers four more years of Bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying jobs, or insure our workers, or help Americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college, policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average American family, and widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street, and left our children with a mountain of debt.

Itâs not change when he promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians, a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in Iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isnât making the American people any safer. So -- So, Iâll say this: There are many words to describe John McCainâs attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bushâs policies as bipartisan and new, but âchangeâ is not one of them. âChangeâ is not one of them, because change is a foreign policy that doesnât begin and end with a war that shouldâve never been authorized and never been waged.

I wonât stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in Iraq, but whatâs not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years, especially at a time when our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other threat to America is being ignored. We -- We must be -- We must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in, but we -- but start leaving we must. Itâs time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their future. Itâs time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care and the benefits they deserve when they come home.

Itâs time -- It's time to refocus our efforts on Al Qaidaâs leadership and Afghanistan, and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease. Thatâs what change is.

Change -- Change, Minnesota, is realizing that meetings [sic] todayâs threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our diplomacy: tough -- tough, direct diplomacy, where the President of the United States isnât afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we stand for. We must once again have the courage and the conviction to lead the free world. That is the legacy of Roosevelt and Truman and Kennedy. Thatâs what the American people demand. Thatâs what change is.

Change is building an economy that rewards not just wealth, but the work and the workers who created it. Itâs understanding that the struggles facing working families canât be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs, but by giving a middle-class tax break to those who need it, and investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation. Itâs understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when Bill Clinton was President.

John McCain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy -- cities in Michigan, and Ohio, and right here in Minnesota -- heâd understand the kind of change that people are looking for.

Maybe if he went to Iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still canât pay the medical bills for a sister whoâs ill, heâd understand she canât afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy. She needs us to pass health care right now, a plan that guarantees insurance to every American who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it. Thatâs the change we need, Minnesota.

Maybe -- Maybe if John McCain went to Pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but canât even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one, heâd understand we canât afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators. That man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future, an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and canât be outsourced. Thatâs the change we need, Minnesota.

And maybe if John McCain spent some time in the schools of South Carolina or St. Paul, Minnesota, or where he spoke tonight in New Orleans, Louisiana, heâd understand that we canât afford to leave the money behind for No Child Left Behind; that we owe it to our children to invest in early-childhood education; and recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support; and finally decide that, in this global economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the few, but a birthright of every American. Thatâs the change we need in America. Thatâs why Iâm running for President of the United States.

Now -- Now, the other side will come here in September and offer a very different set of policies and positions, and that is a good thing. That is a debate I look forward to. It is a debate that the American people deserve on the issues that will help determine the future of this country and the future for our children. But what you donât deserve is another election thatâs governed by fear, and innuendo, and division. What you wonât hear from this campaign or this Party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon. What you wonât see from this campaign or this Party is a politics that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge, but enemies to polarize, because we may call ourselves Democrats and Republicans, but we are Americans first. We are always Americans first.

Despite -- Despite what the good senator from Arizona may have said tonight, Iâve seen people of differing views and opinions find common cause many times during my two decades in public life, and Iâve brought many together myself. Iâve walked arm-in-arm with community leaders on the south side of Chicago and watched tensions fade as black and white and Latino fought together for good jobs and good schools. Iâve sat across the table from law enforcement officials and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice system that sent 13 innocent people to death row. Iâve worked with friends in the other Party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with a tax break, to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the American people know where their tax dollars are being spent, and to reduce the influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in Washington.

In our country -- In our country, I have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything, but because, behind all the false labels and false divisions and categories that define us, beyond all the petty bickering and point-scoring in Washington, Americans are a decent, generous, compassionate people, united by common challenges and common hopes.

And every so often, there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again. So it was for that band of patriots who declared in a Philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union, and for all those who gave on the fields of Gettysburg and Antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union. So it was for the greatest generation that conquered fear itself, and liberated a continent from tyranny, and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity. So it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines, the women who shattered glass ceilings, the children who braved a Selma bridge for freedomâs cause. So it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world thatâs better and kinder and more just.

And so it must be for us.

America, this is our moment. This is our time, our time to turn the page on the policies of the past, our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face, our time to offer a new direction for this country that we love.

The journey will be difficult. The road will be long. I face this challenge -- I face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations, but I also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the American people.

Because if we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that, generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless.

This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.

This was the moment when we ended a war, and secured our nation, and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth.

This was the moment, this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals.

Thank you, Minnesota. God bless you.

God bless the United States of America.Thank you....Thank you. What a -- What a wonderful reception. Thank you, Saint Paul. Thank you, Minnesota.

Thank you, JoAnn Syverson, for the wonderful introduction.

Thank you, Michelle Obama and Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Thank you to my brothers and sisters. Thank you to -- Thank you to my staff. Thank you to our volunteers. Thank you to my political team. Thank you to our campaign manager, David Plouffe, who never gets any credit, but has built the best political organization in the country.

Thank you to my grandmother, who helped raise me, and is sitting in Hawaii somewhere right now because she can't travel, but who poured everything she had into me, and who helped to make me the man I am today. Tonight is for her.

Tonight, Minnesota, after 54 hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end. Sixteen -- Sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Thousands of miles have been traveled; millions of voices have been heard.

And because of what you said, because you decided that change must come to Washington, because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest, because -- because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears, but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another, a journey -- a journey that will bring a new and better day to America.

Because of you, tonight I can stand here and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for the President of the United States of America.

I want to -- I want to thank -- I want to thank -- I want to thank all those in Montana and South Dakota who stood up for change today. I want to thank every American who stood with us over the course of this campaign, through the good days and the bad, from the snows of Cedar Rapids to the sunshine of Sioux Falls.

And, tonight, I also want to thank the men and woman who took this journey with me as fellow candidates for President. You know, at this defining moment -- At this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our Party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for office. I have not just competed with them as rivals. Iâve learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better. They are leaders of this Party and leaders that America will turn to for years to come.

And that is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else: Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign. She has made history not -- not just because sheâs a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she is a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight. I congratulate her on her victory in South Dakota, and I congratulate her on the race that she has run throughout this contest.

Weâve certainly had our differences over the last 16 months. But as someone whoâs shared a stage with her many times, I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning -- even in the face of tough odds -- is exactly what sent her and Bill Clinton to sign up for their first campaign in Texas all those years ago, what sent her to work at the Childrenâs Defense Fund and made her fight for health care as first lady, what led her to the United States Senate and fueled her barrier-breaking campaign for the presidency: an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be.

And you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country -- and we will win that fight -- she will be central to that victory. When we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen. Our Party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.

There are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided. Well, I say that, because of this primary, there are millions of Americans who've cast their ballot for the very first time. There are -- There are Independents and Republicans who understand this election isnât just about a change of Party in Washington, but also about the need to change Washington. There are -- There are young people, and African-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans, and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation.

All of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply. But at the end of the day, we arenât the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard. You didnât do that -- You didnât do that because of me or Senator Clinton or anyone else. You did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, we cannot afford to keep doing what weâve been doing. We owe our children a better future. We owe our country a better future. And for all those who dream of that future tonight, I say: Let us begin the work together. Let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for America.

In just -- In just a few short months, the Republican Party will arrive in St. Paul with a very different agenda. They will -- They will come here to nominate John McCain, a man who has served this country heroically. I honor, we honor the service of John McCain, and I respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny mine. My -- My differences with him -- My differences with him are not personal. They are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign, because while John McCain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his Party in the past, such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign.

Itâs not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year.

Itâs not change when he offers four more years of Bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying jobs, or insure our workers, or help Americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college, policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average American family, and widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street, and left our children with a mountain of debt.

Itâs not change when he promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians, a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in Iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isnât making the American people any safer. So -- So, Iâll say this: There are many words to describe John McCainâs attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bushâs policies as bipartisan and new, but âchangeâ is not one of them. âChangeâ is not one of them, because change is a foreign policy that doesnât begin and end with a war that shouldâve never been authorized and never been waged.

I wonât stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in Iraq, but whatâs not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years, especially at a time when our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other threat to America is being ignored. We -- We must be -- We must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in, but we -- but start leaving we must. Itâs time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their future. Itâs time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care and the benefits they deserve when they come home.

Itâs time -- It's time to refocus our efforts on Al Qaidaâs leadership and Afghanistan, and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease. Thatâs what change is.

Change -- Change, Minnesota, is realizing that meetings [sic] todayâs threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our diplomacy: tough -- tough, direct diplomacy, where the President of the United States isnât afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we stand for. We must once again have the courage and the conviction to lead the free world. That is the legacy of Roosevelt and Truman and Kennedy. Thatâs what the American people demand. Thatâs what change is.

Change is building an economy that rewards not just wealth, but the work and the workers who created it. Itâs understanding that the struggles facing working families canât be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs, but by giving a middle-class tax break to those who need it, and investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation. Itâs understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when Bill Clinton was President.

John McCain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy -- cities in Michigan, and Ohio, and right here in Minnesota -- heâd understand the kind of change that people are looking for.

Maybe if he went to Iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still canât pay the medical bills for a sister whoâs ill, heâd understand she canât afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy. She needs us to pass health care right now, a plan that guarantees insurance to every American who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it. Thatâs the change we need, Minnesota.

Maybe -- Maybe if John McCain went to Pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but canât even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one, heâd understand we canât afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators. That man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future, an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and canât be outsourced. Thatâs the change we need, Minnesota.

And maybe if John McCain spent some time in the schools of South Carolina or St. Paul, Minnesota, or where he spoke tonight in New Orleans, Louisiana, heâd understand that we canât afford to leave the money behind for No Child Left Behind; that we owe it to our children to invest in early-childhood education; and recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support; and finally decide that, in this global economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the few, but a birthright of every American. Thatâs the change we need in America. Thatâs why Iâm running for President of the United States.

","Sen. Barack Obama captured enough convention delegates Tuesday to make a historic claim to the Democratic presidential nomination, the first African-American to earn a major party's nod.

The first-term Illinois senator defeated what had once been the most powerful machine in the party. His rival, Sen. Hillary Clinton, the former first lady who sought to be history's first female nominee, saluted him. But she did not concede, even as she signaled openness to being considered as his vice presidential running mate.

Sen. Clinton's refusal to drop out immediately came after her surprise win in South Dakota's primary Tuesday. That victory didn't change the dynamics of the race. But it underscored some of Sen. Obama's weaknesses, which were on display over the final month of the long campaign, when he suffered a string of landslide losses to his challenger.

Still, the nomination marked a remarkable accomplishment for the son of a Kenyan immigrant who spent part of his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia.

""Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States of America,"" Sen. Obama told an estimated 32,000 people gathered in St. Paul, Minn., late Tuesday.

The venue symbolized his start of the general-election campaign against the likely Republican nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain: In September, Republicans hold their presidential convention in the same city. And Sen. Obama's huge audience, compared with Sen. McCain's less than 1,000 supporters for his speech Tuesday night in New Orleans, dramatizes the Democrats' big edge in voter excitement, evident all year in record turnout for the party's primaries and caucuses.

Sen. McCain, his own nomination locked up months ago, defined the distinction he will draw with the less-experienced 46-year-old Sen. Obama, who is 25 years his junior: ""Both Sen. Obama and I promise we will end Washington's stagnant, unproductive partisanship,"" he said. ""But one of us has a record of working to do that, and one of us doesn't.""

Sen. Obama, in turn, hailed his Republican rival's military service, and ""many accomplishments -- even if he chooses to deny mine. My differences with him are not personal; they are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign"" -- policies that the Illinois senator said would amount to four more years of the unpopular President Bush.

The day's events that set up what will be their five-month contest included a stream of Obama endorsements from local and state party leaders -- the superdelegates -- who can vote their choice at Democrats' August convention in Denver. Those were timed for the end of Democrats' 54 primaries and caucuses in the states and U.S. territories, in which the ""pledged"" delegates were won. Tuesday's Montana and South Dakota primaries were the final contests.

It was the longest nomination race ever. Early returns were in keeping with the closeness of the Obama-Clinton race -- a split decision, with Sen. Obama winning in Montana Tuesday and Sen. Clinton in South Dakota.

Once the polls closed Tuesday night, the Obama campaign released the names of 26.5 superdelegates -- those from Michigan and Florida get half-votes, in punishment for holding their primaries too early. With others that came in through the day, and Sen. Obama's share of Montana's and South Dakota's 31 pledged delegates, he could claim the 2,118-delegate majority needed for nomination.

Sen. Obama started Tuesday roughly 40 delegates shy of the number needed. But he exceeded that with the night's final group endorsement from party leaders. In addition, 10 delegates pledged to former candidate and North Carolina Sen. John Edwards switched to him, besides the pledged delegates he'd get from Tuesday's primaries.

Both campaigns in recent days have discouraged speculation about an Obama-Clinton ticket, particularly given the sometimes bitter exchanges between the two on the campaign trail. But Sen. Clinton left the door open to a match in a conference call with fellow members of Congress from New York, when one of them argued that she was needed on the ticket to help Democrats win in November.

According to the lawmakers, Sen. Clinton told them she wouldn't definitively end her 17-month campaign despite Sen. Obama's delegate lead. This will give her more leverage in talks with the Illinois senator. ""I'm open to it,"" the Associated Press reported her telling Rep. Nydia Velazquez, who told Sen. Clinton her presence on the ticket would help Sen. Obama win the votes of women and Hispanics. Senior advisers said afterward that Sen. Clinton was merely indicating her commitment to do whatever she can to help Democrats win this fall.

And Sen. Clinton brushed aside calls for her to end her campaign last night, telling a crowd of cheering supporters in New York: ""I will be making no decisions tonight."" That raised the prospects of days of wrangling and negotiating.

That the superdelegates would help Sen. Obama seal the nomination marked yet another twist to the tumultuous race. Sen. Clinton began the year with a big edge among superdelegates who'd endorsed a candidate, reflecting her and her husband's longtime leadership of the Democratic Party. Critics of the superdelegate system warned that these party leaders could overturn voters' narrow decision for Sen. Obama. Instead, as he began winning contests in January, superdelegates followed the lead of the voters in the states.

Polls hadn't yet opened Tuesday in Montana and South Dakota when the Obama campaign started announcing superdelegate endorsements. Among the three who pledged support early in the morning was Rep. James Clyburn. The South Carolinian, a civil-rights-era leader and the House's senior African-American, described himself recently as a former ""big-time"" supporter of Bill Clinton. But he became at odds with the former president over what many Democrats considered Mr. Clinton's racially charged statements on the campaign trail.

More Senate colleagues were poised to declare their support for Sen. Obama Wednesday. He already had support from a majority of his and Sen. Clinton's fellow senators, and both Montana senators, Max Baucus and Jon Tester, endorsed him last night, along with Gov. Brian Schweitzer and the state's party chairman.

On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada met with other uncommitted senators to strategize about the race's end. He, along with House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean, continued to argue that uncommitted superdelegates should take sides as soon as the nominating contests were over. The Democratic leadership is keen to wrap up the long and at times bitter campaign so the party can focus on battling the Republicans, both to recapture the White House and to add to their majorities in the House and Senate.

Sen. Clinton, long the Democrats' front-runner and the early favorite, spent Tuesday at home in Chappaqua, N.Y., with her husband, Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea Clinton, working on her final speech. All three had campaigned extensively this week in South Dakota and Puerto Rico. Sen. Clinton won the Puerto Rico primary overwhelmingly on Sunday, and in her victory speech before jubilant supporters, she continued to argue -- in remarks specifically meant for superdelegates -- that she would be the more electable nominee in November, given the extent of her support among women, white men, older voters and blue-collar workers.

Many superdelegates, whose votes proved decisive, weren't buying it. Mr. Clyburn, in his statement, said Sen. Obama ""has created levels of energy and excitement that I have not witnessed since the 1960s,"" especially among younger voters. ""I believe he is the most electable candidate that Democrats can offer. He will be able to dramatically change the electoral map for Democrats which will in turn expand our majorities here in Congress, and help elect more Democrats at the state and local levels.""

Other Democratic politicians have said for months that even if Sen. Obama doesn't win in November -- and some of these politicians believe he can't because of his race -- he would be better at the top of the party's ticket because he will draw young voters, African-Americans, and other new Democrats and independents to the polls in November, thus giving a boost to many Democratic congressional campaigns. They add that he would also be less divisive than Sen. Clinton, and therefore less likely to draw out Republicans to vote against a Democratic ticket.

In her speech Tuesday in New York City, Sen. Clinton again boasted of her accomplishments in winning big states and nearly 18 million votes, weeks after many Democrats were calling for her to give up. ""I'm proud that we stayed the course and stood our ground,"" she said.

But she promised to work for party unity and victory in November and paid tribute to Sen. Obama. He ""has inspired so many Americans to care about politics -- and empowered so many more to get involved,"" she said. ""It has been an honor to contest these primaries with him, just as it is an honor to call him my friend.""

Her campaign advisers sought to downplay talk of an Obama-Clinton ticket, saying she was simply agreeing with supporters that she would do anything to help the ticket. In her speech, Sen. Clinton alluded to the speculation -- ""a lot of people are asking, 'What does Hillary want?'"" The answer, she said, is to end the Iraq war, fix economy, and provide universal health care.
","Senator Barack Obama claimed the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday evening, prevailing through an epic battle with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in a primary campaign that inspired millions of voters from every corner of America to demand change in Washington.

A last-minute rush of Democratic superdelegates, as well as the results from the final primaries, in Montana and South Dakota, pushed Mr. Obama over the threshold of winning the 2,118 delegates needed to be nominated at the partyâs convention in August. The victory for Mr. Obama, the son of a black Kenyan father and a white Kansan mother, broke racial barriers and represented a remarkable rise for a man who just four years ago served in the Illinois Senate.

âTonight, we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another a journey that will bring a new and better day to America,â Mr. Obama told supporters at a rally in St. Paul. âBecause of you, tonight I can stand here and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States of America.â

In a speech to supporters in New York City, Mrs. Clinton paid tribute to Mr. Obama, but she did not leave the race. In a speech more defiant than conciliatory, she again presented her case that she was the stronger candidate and argued that she had won the popular vote, a notion disputed by the Obama campaign.

âI want the nearly 18 million Americans who voted for me to be respected,â Mrs. Clinton told supporters. But she paid homage to Mr. Obamaâs accomplishments, saying, âIt has been an honor to contest the primaries with him, just as it is an honor to call him my friend.â

Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton talked early Wednesday morning by telephone. He congratulated her and renewed his offer to ""sit down when it makes sense for you,"" according to a spokesman for Mr. Obama, Robert Gibbs.

Mrs. Clinton responded positively, Mr. Gibbs said, but added: ""There are no plans to meet tomorrow.""

Mr. Obamaâs victory moved the presidential campaign to a new phase as he tangled with Senator John McCain of Arizona in televised addresses Tuesday night over Mr. Obamaâs assertion that Mr. McCain would carry on President Bushâs policies. Mr. McCain vigorously rebuffed that criticism in a speech in Kenner, La., in which he distanced himself from the departing president while contrasting his own breadth of experience with Mr. Obamaâs record.

âThe American people didnât get to know me yesterday, as they are just getting to know Senator Obama,â Mr. McCain told supporters.

Mr. Obamaâs triumph closed a 16-month primary campaign that broke records on several fronts: the number of voters who participated, the amount of money raised and spent and the sheer length of the fight. The campaign, infused by tensions over race and gender, provided unexpected twists to the end as Mr. Obama ultimately prevailed over Mrs. Clinton, who just a year ago appeared headed toward becoming the first female presidential nominee of a major party.

The last two primaries reflected the partyâs continuing divisions, as Mrs. Clinton won the South Dakota contest and Mr. Obama won Montana.

The race drew to its final hours with a burst of announcements delegate by delegate of Democrats stepping forward to declare their support for Mr. Obama. The Democratic establishment, from former President Jimmy Carter to rank-and-file local officials who make up the partyâs superdelegates, rallied behind Mr. Obama as the day wore on.

When the day began, Mr. Obama needed 41 delegates to effectively claim the nomination. By the time the polls closed in Montana and South Dakota, Mr. Obama had secured the delegates he needed to end his duel with Mrs. Clinton, which wound through every state and territory in an unprecedented 57 contests over five months.

Every time a new endorsement was announced at the Obama headquarters in Chicago, campaign workers interrupted with a booming round of applause, followed by popping Champagne corks later in the evening. The aides are members of Mr. Obamaâs team a political start-up that is responsible for defeating one of the most tried and tested teams in Democratic politics.

While the Democratic race may have ended, a new chapter began in the complicated tensions that have defined the relationship between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. On a conference call with members of the New York Congressional delegation on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton was asked whether she would be open to joining a ticket with Mr. Obama. She replied that she would do whatever she could including a vice-presidential bid to help Democrats win the White House.

Representative Nydia M. VelÃ¡zquez, Democrat of New York, asked Mrs. Clinton whether she would consider teaming up with Mr. Obama. âShe said that if itâs offered, she would take it,â Ms. VelÃ¡zquez said later in an interview.

Mrs. Clinton and her family huddled at her home in Chappaqua to discuss the timing of her departure from the race. At her rally on Tuesday evening, Mrs. Clinton delivered a 20-minute address, but did not directly address speculation about her future.

âNow, the question is, Where do we go from here, and given how far weâve come and where we need to go as a party, itâs a question I donât take lightly,â Mrs. Clinton said, speaking to supporters who were cheering one moment, somber the next. âThis has been a long campaign, and I will be making no decisions tonight.â

As some supporters chanted âDenver! Denver!â referring to the city where Democrats will gather in late August to crown their nominee, she added, âIn the coming days Iâll be consulting with supporters and party leaders determining how to move forward, with the best interest of my party and my country guiding my way.â

Lanny Davis, an aide in the Clinton White House, said he was circulating a petition asking Mr. Obama to pick Mrs. Clinton as his running mate. Mr. Davis said he was acting on his own.

Mr. Obama called Mrs. Clinton late Tuesday evening to congratulate her, but aides said he left a message because he could not reach her. In his speech, his supporters cheered as he paid respect to his rival.

âOur party and our country are better off because of her,â Mr. Obama said, âand I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.â

But associates to Mr. Obama played down the vice-presidential speculation. And he made no reference to it in his 30-minute speech, which was delivered at the same arena in which Mr. McCain is expected to formally accept the Republican nomination at the partyâs convention in early September.

âYou can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country, she will be central to that victory,â Mr. Obama told his supporters. âWhen we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen.â

Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton were both scheduled to speak on Wednesday morning in Washington at a meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Mrs. Clintonâs public schedule ended there, but Mr. Obama was set to campaign on Thursday in Virginia, a state his campaign calls a battleground.

The competition between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama has been sharpening for weeks, but the close of the Democratic primary formally raised the curtain to a five-month general election contest. The race, as their respective speeches foreshadowed Tuesday evening, will unfold against a backdrop of an electorate that is restless about soaring gasoline prices, mortgage foreclosures and the Iraq war.

It is also a generational battle of personalities and contrasting styles. Mr. McCain staged an evening event in Louisiana so he would be included in the eveningâs television narrative that otherwise belonged to Democrats.

About two hours later, Mr. Obama responded at a rally that offered a sharp contrast both in the size of the crowd and the energy in the room.

âThere are many words to describe John McCainâs attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bushâs policies as bipartisan and new,â Mr. Obama said. âBut âchangeâ is not one of them.â

2,2,2008-11-05-ObamaElected.txt,"Hello, Chicago.

If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy: Tonight is your answer.

It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voices could be that difference.

It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled -- Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United States of America!

It's the answer that -- that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful about what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.

It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.

A little bit earlier this evening, I received an extraordinarily gracious call from Senator McCain. Senator McCain fought long and hard in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the country that he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine. We are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader. I congratulate him; I congratulate Governor Palin for all that they've achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.

I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on the train home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.

And I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation's next First Lady: Michelle Obama. Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother's watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight, and I know that my debt to them is beyond measure. To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers and sisters -- thank you so much for the support that you've given me. I am grateful to them.

And to my campaign manager, David Plouffe -- the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best -- the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America. To my chief strategist David Axelrod -- who's been a partner with me every step of the way. To the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics -- you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.

But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give 5 dollars and 10 dollars and 20 dollars to the cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep. It drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth. This is your victory.

And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime: two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage or pay their doctors' bills or save enough for their child's college education. There's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair.

The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you, we as a people will get there.

There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as President. And we know the government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And, above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years -- block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand. What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night.

This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other. Let us remember that, if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers. In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.

Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a Party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity. Those are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours: ""We are not enemies but friends...."" ""Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.""

And to those Americans who -- whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your President, too.

And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.

To those -- To those who would tear the world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright: Tonight we've proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.

That's the true genius of America: that America can change. Our union can be perfected. What we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.

This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight's about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.

She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.

And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America -- the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.

At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot: Yes we can.

When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose: Yes we can.

When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved: Yes we can.

She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that ""we shall overcome"": Yes we can.

A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination.

And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change: Yes we can.

America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves -- if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?

This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can.

Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.
","Sen. Barack Obama was elected the nation's first African-American president, defeating Sen. John McCain decisively Tuesday as citizens surged to the polls in a presidential race that climaxed amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

The culmination of the epic two-year campaign marks a historic moment in a nation that since its founding has struggled with racial divisions. It also ushers in a period of dominance for Democrats in Washington for the first time since the early years of President Bill Clinton's first term. With Tuesday's elections, Sen. Obama's party will control both houses of Congress as well as the White House, setting the scene for Democrats to push an ambitious agenda from health care to financial regulation to ending the war in Iraq.

In becoming the U.S.'s 44th president, Illinois Sen. Obama, 47 years old, defeated Arizona Sen. McCain, 72, a veteran lawmaker and Vietnam War hero. Despite a reputation for bucking his own party, Sen. McCain could not overcome a Democratic tide, which spurred voters to take a risk on a candidate with less than four years of national political experience. Sen. Obama is the first northern Democrat elected president since John F. Kennedy in 1960.

Also elected: Joe Biden of Delaware as vice president, the veteran senator who has promised to help Sen. Obama steer his agenda through Congress.

Sen. Obama's victory was built on record fund raising and a vast national campaign network. It remade the electoral map that had held fast for eight years. He overwhelmed reliable Democratic strongholds in the Northeast and West Coast. He won big in the industrial Midwest and contested fiercely in areas of traditional Republican strength. He won Virginia, the first time a Democratic candidate had taken the state since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. And he finally wrested Florida and Ohio from the GOP, two states that had bedeviled his party in the last two elections.

The president-elect will enter office with a long policy wish list that includes ending the war in Iraq, implementing a near-universal health-insurance plan and finding alternatives to Middle Eastern oil. All this will have to be carried out amid record budget deficits, a looming crisis in Social Security and Medicare spending as the baby- boom generation retires and fears that the nation is on the edge of a deep recession.

Democrats have touted the prospect of a big sweep not just as a partisan conquest but as an ideological turning point, one that could reverse the last great shift in 1980, when Ronald Reagan ushered in a period dominated by tax-cutting conservatism and muscular foreign policy.

It's a startling turnaround from just four years ago, when Republicans controlled Congress and the White House, and benefited from a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The party's intellectual leaders spoke of a permanent Republican majority in Washington.

What remains unclear, however, is whether Tuesday's results represent a vote for liberalism or against the failures of the Bush administration, including the early war years in Iraq, the calamity of Hurricane Katrina and the current economic slump.

The transition to an Obama administration could begin almost immediately. A shadow Treasury team could be in place by the end of the week, aides say. In many ways, the transition has already started. John Podesta, a former White House chief of staff under President Clinton, has been leading quiet conversations about key positions, especially those relating to the economy.

Late in the evening, Sen. Obama hit 338 electoral-college votes -- far exceeding the threshold of 270 needed to win -- with victories in the battleground states of Florida, Ohio and Virginia. National exit poll results found Sen. Obama increasing his vote percentages across the board, with particular success coming from the youth and black votes, as many in his campaign had predicted. Although a preliminary figure, his 51% of the popular vote marks the first time since Mr. Johnson that a Democrat had clearly won more than half the nation's vote.

Sen. Obama took 96% of black voters, who increased their share of the electorate to 13% from 11%. Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts won 88% of the black vote in 2004. Sen. Obama won two-thirds of Hispanics and more than two-thirds of voters aged 18 to 29.

One important swing was the Roman Catholic vote, which went 47% to Sen. Kerry in 2004, compared with 53% for Sen. Obama.

Sen. Obama won among independents but divided the suburban vote. And among voters in families earning over $200,000 a year, Sen. Obama improved over Sen. Kerry by 17 points.

Helping Sen. Obama: Democrats made up a larger share of the electorate this year than they did four years ago, when equal numbers of voters identified as Democrats and as Republicans. This time, 40% said they were Democrats and just 32% said they were Republicans.

Sen. Obama's campaign organization reached corners of the country largely untouched by previous Democratic candidates, from Boise, Idaho, to Biloxi, Miss. It didn't work out everywhere -- he lost North Dakota and Georgia. But he put long-standing Republican territory into play, a tactic that put Sen. McCain on the defensive.

Democrats also bolstered their majorities on Capitol Hill. The party secured a number of Senate victories, bringing it teasingly close to a filibuster-proof margin. Party leaders will likely be able to make up the one or two additional votes with moderate Republicans. The party picked up at least 10 House seats, a number expected to grow significantly.

In Arizona, Sen. McCain offered congratulations to his opponent and spoke of the historic moment and the importance of the day to African- Americans. A century ago, he recalled, there was outrage in many quarters when President Theodore Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington to visit the White House.

""America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time,"" Sen. McCain said during a gracious concession speech. ""There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African- American to the presidency of the United States.""

The Arizona senator also pledged to put the bitterness of the campaign aside and to work with the new president through the difficult times facing the nation.

Sen. McCain phoned Sen. Obama to concede the race and both men pledged to work together. President George W. Bush also phoned the victor and promised a smooth transition. ""You are about to go on one of the great journeys of life. Congratulations and go enjoy yourself,"" the president told his successor.

Sen. Obama declared victory in Chicago's Grant Park in front of an audience of 125,000 people, saying, ""If there is anyone out there who still doubts America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders are alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.""

The 2008 election, the longest and most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history, was a watershed in many ways. It featured the first woman -- New York Sen. Hillary Clinton -- to seriously contend for a party nomination. Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska became the first woman to appear on the Republican ticket. And Sen. Obama broke ground as the first black party nominee for president.

""Obama is documentation of America's moral progress, the moral evolution we have gone through in the past 40 years,"" said Shelby Steele, a black writer and a fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution, who voted for Sen. McCain. ""Whites don't get credit for it. But having grown up myself in segregation -- America has changed enormously.""

The candidates spent about $1.6 billion on the election, double the 2004 presidential race, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. When all is tallied, Sen. Obama is expected to have raised around $700 million, a sum made possible when he opted to forgo public financing, the first candidate to do so since the system was implemented in the wake of the Watergate scandal. That decision, and the resulting bonanza, is likely to change how future campaigns are funded.

Indications from early voting and lengthy lines at the polls point to the biggest voter turnout in the period since women got the vote in 1920. In total, voter registration numbers were up 7.3% compared with the last presidential election, for a total of 153 million eligible voters.

The race also featured the most extensive use yet of the Internet. Online social networks spread the campaign to corners of the country that had never before experienced such intense electioneering.

""I wanted to be part of this historic day in our country and watch people in this community exercise their God-given right,"" said Earl Simms, a 65-year-old former city safety manager standing at the head of the line at his Jacksonville, Fla., precinct.

By tradition, the first ballots were cast just after midnight in tiny Dixville Notch, N.H. Sen. Obama got 15 votes and Sen. McCain six.

Many African-Americans were celebrating how far a black man had come.

""It's a feeling we feel all the way inside -- Lord, we're finally overcoming,"" said Willie Smiley, 65, a retired government worker from Detroit.

Benjamin T. Jealous, president and CEO of the NAACP, the nation's oldest civil-rights group, said his 92-year-old grandmother, whose grandfather was a slave, is ""giddy"" at the prospect of seeing young black girls holding pajama parties at the White House.

""At this moment, it feels as if anything is possible, and that is the way it needs to be in this country,"" he said in an interview Tuesday.

Sen. Obama launched his candidacy on the statehouse steps of Springfield, Ill., nearly two years ago. He was a freshman senator, largely unknown, noted mostly for a keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention and a best-selling book. The son of a white woman from Kansas and a Kenyan immigrant who once herded goats, the relative newcomer came with a foreign-sounding name and associations that would prove to be liabilities.

His spiritual adviser, the Rev, Jeremiah Wright, had issued incendiary sermons from the pulpit of Sen. Obama's church. A convicted felon, Tony Rezko, helped him purchase a Chicago home. And Republicans tried to tie Sen. Obama to an associate and neighbor, William Ayers, a member of a domestic terrorist organization in the 1960s.

With that baggage, he took on one of the most powerful names in Democratic politics, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, defeating her after an epic primary fight. Sen. Obama's campaign beat the formidable Clinton machine by going where she was not, racking up victories in states such as Idaho, Kansas and Wyoming.

In the general election campaign, Sen. Obama held the lead for most of the summer. Following back-to-back conventions, Sen. McCain briefly pulled ahead after he energized his party by choosing Gov. Palin as his running mate. When the financial crisis hit, causing stocks to plummet and the government to embark on a series of unprecedented interventions in markets, voters were reminded of their economic concerns and Sen. Obama pulled ahead again. He never lost the lead.

""I've been in denial for too long,"" said Jennifer Cresent, a Macomb County, Mich., Republican who voted for President Bush four years ago and Sen. Obama Tuesday. ""I thought we were really fine and people complained too much. Then every other house on my street became vacant. And so many people are out of work. Now I really worry about crime.""

During the primaries, Sen. McCain's campaign was large and expensive and nearly collapsed. He began again with a bare-bones operation, running as a promoter of the war in Iraq at a time when it was deeply unpopular. He pushed for and then backed the early 2007 surge in troops that turned out to be an important factor in the country's turnaround.

After winning the nomination, Sen. McCain still had work to do with the conservative base of his party. Many in the base were angered by his push to change the nation's immigration laws and campaign-finance rules, his support for embryonic stem cell research and his opposition to the Bush tax cuts.

He struggled to find a message that would resonate, running at various times as the experienced insider, a maverick who would shake up Washington, a bipartisan conciliator, a tax-cutting conservative and a tough-minded ""Country First"" war hero.

The choice of Gov. Palin thrilled conservatives but turned off other voters, especially independents. Early exit polls Tuesday found that six in 10 voters said she is not qualified to be president. Those voters overwhelmingly favored Sen. Obama.

Sen. McCain's campaign received a jolt in October when taxes became a hot issue, but it was never enough to overcome Sen. Obama's optimistic, though vague slogan of hope, which appealed to an electorate angry over war, the economy and President Bush, who has one of the lowest approval ratings on record.

According to early exit poll data, 62% of voters said the economy was their top concern. All other issues, including terrorism and the war in Iraq, were far behind. In 2004, terrorism and the economy were tied at about 20%.

Sen. Obama's promises will be a challenge to keep in the face of a likely recession, two wars and record budget deficits.

He has promised to end the war in Iraq and reduce troop levels quickly. He has also vowed to redouble efforts to stabilize Afghanistan, beef up the U.S. military presence there and to reinvigorate efforts against al Qaeda, both in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He promised to create a new government-organized health care marketplace and cut taxes for every family earning less than $200,000 and raise them for families over $250,000.

He has vowed to wean the country of Middle Eastern oil over 10 years, dedicating $150 billion to alternative and renewable energy research and development, likening the challenge to that of putting a man on the moon. He has said he will cap greenhouse-gas emissions and force polluters to begin paying for emission permits in order to tackle global warming.

He has also promised billions of federal dollars for education, teacher training and recruitment. College applicants would be given tax incentives to offset tuition in exchange for national service.

In the short run, Sen. Obama has promised to prime the flagging economy with billions of dollars for infrastructure, unemployment insurance and Medicaid. Banks would have to temporarily halt home foreclosures in exchange for government assistance.

The incoming president will have some advantages, including the apparent enthusiastic backing of voters. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Monday found that 81% of Obama supporters said their vote was for him, not against Sen. McCain. Exit polls found 56% of voters were either optimistic or excited about what Sen. Obama would do as president.

And two-thirds of voters in the Journal poll said they understand Sen. Obama's message and know what he will do as president, just shy of the 72% who said that about President Bush when he stood for re- election in 2004.

With strong majorities in Congress, President-elect Obama is likely to start fast, with a large economic-stimulus package, legislation to fund embryonic stem-cell research and an expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, a government insurance program, which will be financed with a rise in the tobacco tax.

After that, Democrats are divided over how to proceed. Old-guard liberals want to move as fast as possible while they have solid majorities and an electoral mandate. Conservative Democrats want more attention paid to a federal budget deficit that could approach $1 trillion this fiscal year.

Democratic leaders in Congress, mindful of Bill Clinton's health- care debacle of 1993 and the Republican resurgence that swept them from power the next year, counsel a cautious approach that builds bipartisan and voter support before moving on the president-elect's big-ticket items.

The president-elect will not have much time to decide. By early February, he will have to produce a budget that lays out his spending and tax priorities at least over the next five years and hints at what he will do to confront the looming costs of Social Security and Medicare.
","Barack Hussein Obama was elected the 44th president of the United States on Tuesday, sweeping away the last racial barrier in American politics with ease as the country chose him as its first black chief executive.

The election of Mr. Obama amounted to a national catharsis â a repudiation of a historically unpopular Republican president and his economic and foreign policies, and an embrace of Mr. Obamaâs call for a change in the direction and the tone of the country.

But it was just as much a strikingly symbolic moment in the evolution of the nationâs fraught racial history, a breakthrough that would have seemed unthinkable just two years ago.

Mr. Obama, 47, a first-term senator from Illinois, defeated Senator John McCain of Arizona, 72, a former prisoner of war who was making his second bid for the presidency.

To the very end, Mr. McCainâs campaign was eclipsed by an opponent who was nothing short of a phenomenon, drawing huge crowds epitomized by the tens of thousands of people who turned out to hear Mr. Obamaâs victory speech in Grant Park in Chicago.

Mr. McCain also fought the headwinds of a relentlessly hostile political environment, weighted down with the baggage left to him by President Bush and an economic collapse that took place in the middle of the general election campaign.

âIf there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer,â said Mr. Obama, standing before a huge wooden lectern with a row of American flags at his back, casting his eyes to a crowd that stretched far into the Chicago night.

âItâs been a long time coming,â the president-elect added, âbut tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.â

Mr. McCain delivered his concession speech under clear skies on the lush lawn of the Arizona Biltmore, in Phoenix, where he and his wife had held their wedding reception. The crowd reacted with scattered boos as he offered his congratulations to Mr. Obama and saluted the historical significance of the moment.

âThis is a historic election, and I recognize the significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight,â Mr. McCain said, adding, âWe both realize that we have come a long way from the injustices that once stained our nationâs reputation.â

Not only did Mr. Obama capture the presidency, but he led his party to sharp gains in Congress. This puts Democrats in control of the House, the Senate and the White House for the first time since 1995, when Bill Clinton was in office.

The day shimmered with history as voters began lining up before dawn, hours before polls opened, to take part in the culmination of a campaign that over the course of two years commanded an extraordinary amount of attention from the American public.

As the returns became known, and Mr. Obama passed milestone after milestone âOhio, Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa and New Mexico â people rolled spontaneously into the streets to celebrate what many described, with perhaps overstated if understandable exhilaration, a new era in a country where just 143 years ago, Mr. Obama, as a black man, could have been owned as a slave.

For Republicans, especially the conservatives who have dominated the party for nearly three decades, the night represented a bitter setback and left them contemplating where they now stand in American politics.

Mr. Obama and his expanded Democratic majority on Capitol Hill now face the task of governing the country through a difficult period: the likelihood of a deep and prolonged recession, and two wars. He took note of those circumstances in a speech that was notable for its sobriety and its absence of the triumphalism that he might understandably have displayed on a night when he won an Electoral College landslide.

âThe road ahead will be long, our climb will be steep,â said Mr. Obama, his audience hushed and attentive, with some, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, wiping tears from their eyes. âWe may not get there in one year or even one term, but America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you, we as a people will get there.â The roster of defeated Republicans included some notable party moderates, like Senator John E. Sununu of New Hampshire and Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, and signaled that the Republican conference convening early next year in Washington will be not only smaller but more conservative.

Mr. Obama will come into office after an election in which he laid out a number of clear promises: to cut taxes for most Americans, to get the United States out of Iraq in a fast and orderly fashion, and to expand health care.

In a recognition of the difficult transition he faces, given the economic crisis, Mr. Obama is expected to begin filling White House jobs as early as this week.

Mr. Obama defeated Mr. McCain in Ohio, a central battleground in American politics, despite a huge effort that brought Mr. McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, back there repeatedly. Mr. Obama had lost the state decisively to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York in the Democratic primary.

Mr. McCain failed to take from Mr. Obama the two Democratic states that were at the top of his target list: New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Mr. Obama also held on to Minnesota, the state that played host to the convention that nominated Mr. McCain; Wisconsin; and Michigan, a state Mr. McCain once had in his sights.

The apparent breadth of Mr. Obamaâs sweep left Republicans sobered, and his showing in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania stood out because officials in both parties had said that his struggles there in the primary campaign reflected the resistance of blue-collar voters to supporting a black candidate.

âI always thought there was a potential prejudice factor in the state,â Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat of Pennsylvania who was an early Obama supporter, told reporters in Chicago. âI hope this means we washed that away.â

Mr. McCain called Mr. Obama at 10 p.m., Central time, to offer his congratulations. In the call, Mr. Obama said he was eager to sit down and talk; in his concession speech, Mr. McCain said he was ready to help Mr. Obama work through difficult times.

âI need your help,â Mr. Obama told his rival, according to an Obama adviser, Robert Gibbs. âYouâre a leader on so many important issues.â

Mr. Bush called Mr. Obama shortly after 10 p.m. to congratulate him on his victory.

âI promise to make this a smooth transition,â the president said to Mr. Obama, according to a transcript provided by the White House .âYou are about to go on one of the great journeys of life. Congratulations, and go enjoy yourself.â

For most Americans, the news of Mr. Obamaâs election came at 11 p.m., Eastern time, when the networks, waiting for the close of polls in California, declared him the victor. A roar sounded from the 125,000 people gathered in Hutchison Field in Grant Park at the moment that they learned Mr. Obama had been projected the winner.

The scene in Phoenix was decidedly more sour. At several points, Mr. McCain, unsmiling, had to motion his crowd to quiet down â he held out both hands, palms down â when they responded to his words of tribute to Mr. Obama with boos.

Mr. Obama, who watched Mr. McCainâs speech from his hotel room in Chicago, offered a hand to voters who had not supported him in this election, when he took the stage 15 minutes later. âTo those Americans whose support I have yet to earn,â he said, âI may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your president, too.â

Initial signs were that Mr. Obama benefited from a huge turnout of voters, but particularly among blacks. That group made up 13 percent of the electorate, according to surveys of people leaving the polls, compared with 11 percent in 2006.

In North Carolina, Republicans said that the huge surge of African-Americans was one of the big factors that led to Senator Elizabeth Dole, a Republican, losing her re-election bid.

Mr. Obama also did strikingly well among Hispanic voters; Mr. McCain did worse among those voters than Mr. Bush did in 2004. That suggests the damage the Republican Party has suffered among those voters over four years in which Republicans have been at the forefront on the effort to crack down on illegal immigrants.

The election ended what by any definition was one of the most remarkable contests in American political history, drawing what was by every appearance unparalleled public interest.

Throughout the day, people lined up at the polls for hours â some showing up before dawn â to cast their votes. Aides to both campaigns said that anecdotal evidence suggested record-high voter turnout.

Reflecting the intensity of the two candidates, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama took a page from what Mr. Bush did in 2004 and continued to campaign after the polls opened.

Mr. McCain left his home in Arizona after voting early Tuesday to fly to Colorado and New Mexico, two states where Mr. Bush won four years ago but where Mr. Obama waged a spirited battle.

These were symbolically appropriate final campaign stops for Mr. McCain, reflecting the imperative he felt of trying to defend Republican states against a challenge from Mr. Obama.

âGet out there and vote,â Mr. McCain said in Grand Junction, Colo. âI need your help. Volunteer, knock on doors, get your neighbors to the polls, drag them there if you need to.â

By contrast, Mr. Obama flew from his home in Chicago to Indiana, a state that in many ways came to epitomize the audacity of his effort this year. Indiana has not voted for a Democrat since President Lyndon B. Johnsonâs landslide victory in 1964, and Mr. Obama made an intense bid for support there. He later returned home to Chicago to play basketball, his election-day ritual.

3,3,2009-01-05-EconomyPlans.txt,"All right. Well, thanks for taking the time to come in for a moment. You know, this is the core of my economic team, and the message of our meeting today is one that comes as no surprise to most Americans, and that is we are in a very difficult spot. The economy is bad. The situation is getting worse.

Last week, we learned that manufacturing had hit a 20-year low. On Friday, we're going to get the final jobs report from this year, and every indication is that we will have lost in 2008 more jobs than at any time since World War II.

It's clear that we have to act and we have to act now to address this crisis and break the momentum of the recession or the next few years could be dramatically worse. That's the message that I delivered to Speaker Pelosi this morning. I will be meeting with Harry Reid and with the bipartisan leadership group this afternoon.

And the most important message today is that the situation is getting worse, we've got to act boldly, and we've got to act swiftly. We cannot delay.

I said in my Web address this past Saturday, this is not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem at this stage. This is an American problem, and we're all going to have to chip in and do the hard work that's required and what the American people expect of us.

Over the last few weeks, our economic crisis has only grown deeper. Two million Americans have now lost their jobs over the last year. We have a substantial number -- in fact, Christina Romer, our economist from the Council of Economic Advisers, indicates to me that in addition to the 2 million who've lost jobs, you've got 2.8 million who have moved from full-time work to part-time work.

So when you start counting in people who are underemployed, then the situation is very dire for American families.

Again, manufacturing's hit a 28-year low.

Across America, millions of Americans are struggling with rising costs, growing debts, concerns about home foreclosure, a deepening sense of unease.

When I last met with my team, I asked them to continue their work on an American recovery and reinvestment plan that would not only create jobs in the short term, but also spur economic growth and lay the foundation for a sustained competitiveness in this global economy over the long term.

During today's meeting, I learned about the substantial progress that they've made in developing that plan. And we are beginning to share details of that plan with leadership on the Hill. And we will be rolling this out to the American people, assuring that there is clarity and transparency about the entire process.

One of the things that I've emphasized to my team -- and one of the things that I've emphasized to congressional leadership and will emphasize again today -- is that not only do we have to act boldly, swiftly and with a sufficient magnitude to make a difference, but we've also got to do things in a new way.

It's not going to be sufficient for us just to fall back into the old Washington ways and simply throw money at the problem. We need to demand vigorous oversight; we need to have strict accountability in terms of how the -- the recovery and reinvestment plan operates.

The American people have a right to know how every dime of their money is spent, and that is going to be built into the plan, so that everybody understands what is being done in order to address this crisis.

We also in this group talked today about the financial system that is still precarious. We have not seen the credit markets recover the way we would have liked to see them recover, despite the efforts of Treasury and of the Fed, the many unprecedented steps that have been taken.

And so part of this team's task is to shape the next phase of economic recovery so that it is more transparent, so that it is more consistent, so that the public and the markets and businesses all understand exactly how it is working, what our expectations are and what will be accomplished as a consequence of some of the extraordinary steps that have been taken.

Finally, we talked today about the tough choices that we're going to have to make to restore fiscal responsibility, so as the economy recovers, our deficit can start to be brought down. As I said earlier, right now, the most important task for us is to stabilize the patient. The economy is badly damaged; it is very sick. And so we have to take whatever is -- steps are required to make sure that it is stabilized.

But we also have to recognize that if we're going to grow this economy over the long term, if we're going to create a better future for our children and our grandchildren, then we can't be fiscally irresponsible about how we do it.

And so -- we have been in deep conversations and will continue over the next several weeks to shape our recovery and reinvestment package alongside very concrete, serious plans for midterm and long- term fiscal discipline. And that is something that we will be also be presenting to the American people as well as leadership on Capitol Hill.

So I'm looking forward to meeting with both the Democrats and Republicans this afternoon. My expectation is that they will share the same sense of urgency that I do, that we are going to move quickly, that we're not going to get bogged down in a lot of old-style politics on either side.

There's not going to be a lot of finger-pointing or posturing. The American people need action now. That's what I intend to provide as president of the United States. So with that, let me take a couple questions.
","President-elect Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are crafting a plan to offer about $300 billion of tax cuts to individuals and businesses, a move aimed at attracting Republican support for an economic-stimulus package and prodding companies to create jobs.

The size of the proposed tax cuts -- which would account for about 40% of a stimulus package that could reach $775 billion over two years -- is greater than many on both sides of the aisle in Congress had anticipated. It may make it easier to win over Republicans who have stressed that any initiative should rely more heavily on tax cuts rather than spending.

The Obama tax-cut proposals, if enacted, could pack more punch in two years than either of President George W. Bush's tax cuts did in their first two years. Mr. Bush's 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut of 2001, considered the largest in history, contained $174 billion of cuts during its first two full years, according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. The second-largest tax cut -- the 10-year, $350 billion package engineered by Mr. Bush in 2003 -- contained $231 billion in 2004 and 2005.

Republicans and business leaders hadn't seen specifics of the proposals Sunday night, but welcomed the idea of basing a bigger proportion of the stimulus plan on tax cuts. Their response suggests the legislation could attract relatively broad support, and it highlighted the Obama team's determination to win backing from varied interests.

Some Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), have warned against a careless stimulus plan that enables unfettered spending.

The largest piece of tax relief in the new plan would involve cuts for people who pay income taxes or who claim the earned-income credit, a refund designed to lessen the impact of payroll taxes on low- and moderate-income workers. This component would serve as a down payment on the ""Making Work Pay"" proposal Mr. Obama outlined during his election campaign, giving a credit of $500 per individual or $1,000 per family.

On the campaign trail, Mr. Obama said he would phase out a similar tax-credit proposal at around $200,000 per household, but aides said they haven't settled on an income cap for the latest proposal. This part of the plan is similar to a bipartisan initiative launched in early 2008, which sent out checks worth $131 billion.

Economists of all political stripes widely agree the checks sent out last spring were ineffective in stemming the economic slide, partly because many strapped consumers paid bills or saved the cash rather than spend it. But Obama aides wanted a provision that could get money into consumers' hands fast, and hope they will be persuaded to spend money this time if the credit is made a permanent feature of the tax code.

As for the business tax package, a key provision would allow companies to write off huge losses incurred last year, as well as any losses from 2009, to retroactively reduce tax bills dating back five years. Obama aides note that businesses would have been able to claim most of the tax write-offs on future tax returns, and the proposal simply accelerates those write-offs to make them available in the current tax season, when a lack of available credit is leaving many companies short of cash.

A second provision would entice firms to plow that money back into new investment. The write-offs would be retroactive to expenditures made as of Jan. 1, 2009, to ensure that companies don't sit on their money until after Congress passes the measure.

Another element would offer a one-year tax credit for companies that make new hires or forgo layoffs, which could be worth $40 billion to $50 billion. And the Obama plan also would allow small businesses to write off a broad range expenditures worth up to $250,000 in 2009 and 2010. Currently, the limit is $175,000.

William Gale, a tax-policy analyst at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said the scale of the whole package is larger than expected. He called the business offerings a true surprise, since most attention has been focused on the spending side of the equation, especially the hundreds of billions of dollars being discussed for infrastructure and aid to state and local governments.

""On the other hand, it was hard to figure out how they were going to spend all that money in intelligent ways, so it makes sense to do more on the tax side,"" Mr. Gale said. His biggest question about the latest proposal concerns the credits for hiring new workers or refraining from layoffs. Much of that money would likely go to companies that would have hired more people anyway, he said, adding that it is impossible to know what firms would have done without such a credit.

Business lobbyists are pushing hard for Congress to allow companies that haven't paid corporate income taxes to get a break, too. Start-up companies, alternative-energy firms and large corporations that have been swallowing losses for years -- such as automotive and steel companies and some airlines -- have already begun lobbying for such ""refundability.""

They argue that a provision to claim losses on back taxes will have little effect on the economy if firms that need it most -- struggling companies that weren't obligated to pay any taxes -- can't benefit from a tax break.

Mr. Obama, however, doesn't back payments to companies that haven't paid taxes, aides said. Instead, businesses that haven't been paying taxes would be able to get payments from tax credits they would have taken in 2008 and 2009 for incentives offered by Congress, such as the production tax credit offered to renewable-energy firms. These amounts would likely be relatively small.

""We're working with Congress to develop a tax-cut package based on a simple principle: What will have the biggest and most immediate impact on creating private-sector jobs and strengthening the middle class?"" said transition-team spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter. ""We're guided by what works, not by any ideology or special interests.""

As these details are being worked out, Mr. Obama and his family left Chicago during the weekend for Washington. He will be on Capitol Hill Monday, first to meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), then with the broader bipartisan leadership of Congress. The stimulus package will be front-and-center in those discussions.

Democratic leaders and Obama aides acknowledge that congressional Democrats' initial goal of passing the recovery package before Mr. Obama's Jan. 20 inauguration is unrealistic. Now, they hope for passage before the Feb. 13 congressional recess.

Republicans are already criticizing parts of the stimulus package. Sen. McConnell, speaking Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" questioned one of the biggest items, which would send as much as $200 billion to states largely to expand the federal share of Medicaid, the health program for the poor. He suggested structuring that aid as a loan, saying it would encourage states to ""spend it more wisely.""

An array of business tax cuts could help overcome such GOP opposition, enabling the Democrats to present their plan as a balanced mix of tax cuts and spending. It also would likely encourage business interests to lobby hard for its enactment.

Mr. Obama's team has spoken of wanting to attract significant Republican support, not simply picking up votes from a Republican moderate or two.

Obama aides have already enlisted business groups to rally behind spending for public-works projects. Norman R. Augustine, a former chairman and chief executive of Lockheed Martin Corp., will testify before the House Democrats' Steering and Policy Committee Wednesday in favor of an infusion of federal infrastructure spending. But the tax cuts may hold more sway with Republicans.
","President-elect Barack Obama plans to include about $300 billion in tax cuts for workers and businesses in his economic recovery program, advisers said Sunday, as his team seeks to win over Congressional skeptics worried that he was too focused on government spending.

The legislation Mr. Obama is developing with Congressional Democrats will devote about 40 percent of the cost to tax cuts, including his centerpiece campaign promise to provide credits up to $500 for most workers, costing roughly $150 billion. The package will also include more than $100 billion in tax incentives for businesses to create jobs and invest in equipment or factories.

The overall economic package, of $675 billion to $775 billion, is taking shape as Mr. Obama arrived in Washington and planned to begin trying to build support in Congress and among the broader public for his approach to stimulating the economy. Mr. Obama, who flew to the capital on Sunday to join his family in a hotel suite while awaiting his inauguration, planned to meet with Congressional leaders on Monday and deliver a speech on Thursday laying the ground for his emerging economic program.

Although some tax cuts were always expected to be included in Mr. Obama's economic package, his team disclosed the scope and some details of the plans on Sunday at a time when Republicans have begun voicing criticism of what they describe as an open-checkbook approach to spending. By focusing more attention on the tax cuts in the plan, Obama aides hope to frame it as a balanced, pragmatic approach.

Mr. Obama will use his public events this week to promise what one adviser called ""radical reforms"" to impose more control over the regular federal budget down the road. Among other areas, the president-elect will focus on changing Pentagon contracting and aid to corporate America, advisers said. He will also designate a chief performance officer and a chief technology officer on Wednesday to help make government more efficient, they said.

Still, Democratic leaders in Congress acknowledged that the economic package would not be ready for Mr. Obama's signature immediately after his inauguration on Jan. 20, as they once hoped.

""It's going to be very difficult to get the package put together that early so that it can have sufficient time to be reviewed, and then sufficient time to be debated and passed,"" Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader, said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Mr. Hoyer said a more likely goal would be mid-February before Congress leaves on a Presidents' Day recess. ""We certainly want to see this package passed through the House of Representatives no later than the end of this month, get it over to the Senate, and have it to the president before we break for the presidential break,"" Mr. Hoyer said.

Congressional Republicans continued to press for more public hearings and study, and some of their leaders threw out their own ideas for what should be in the plan. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, proposed Sunday that any money distributed to the states be provided as loans rather than outright grants.

""Nobody thinks we ought to be spending this money on things like mob museums and waterslides,"" Mr. McConnell said on ""This Week"" on ABC. ""And if the money were lent rather than just granted, states would I think spend it wisely, and the states that didn't need it at all wouldn't take any.""

Mr. McConnell said Republicans were more likely to favor tax relief and tax credits as part of the economic measure and said Congress should consider reducing the 25 percent income tax rate to 15 percent.

Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House speaker, said Congress would also take on the issue of waste in federal agencies, though she was not ready to disclose details of her approach. ""We will have reforms related to waste, fraud and abuse,"" she said in an interview.

Other Congressional officials said House Democrats would consider a plan this week requiring a new audit of all federal agencies and mandating Congressional hearings whenever inspectors general identify potential waste or fraud.

Mr. Obama's team argued Sunday that the short-term cost of its economic plan was not a priority in the face of the dire problems in the economy. ""There is no short run, other than keeping the economy from absolutely tanking. That's the only short run,"" Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on ""This Week."" He added, ""We've got to begin to stem this bleeding here, and begin to stop the loss of jobs and the creation of jobs.""

The economic package under consideration by the president-elect and his Congressional allies would commit $675 billion to $775 billion over two years. If the tax cuts represent 40 percent of that, as Mr. Obama's advisers said Sunday, that would mean about $270 billion to $310 billion.

About half of that would go to workers under what Mr. Obama during his campaign called the Making Work Pay credit, worth up to $500 for individuals and $1,000 for families. The Obama campaign estimated that about 150 million Americans making less than $200,000 would qualify, including those who make too little to pay federal income taxes but would receive a check that would offset Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes.

Mr. Obama's advisers said Sunday that they were searching for a way to get that credit into Americans' pockets quickly to help stimulate spending, but would not duplicate the rebate checks sent last year as part of an economic package signed by President Bush. Instead, they said, they were discussing making the credit retroactive to the 2008 tax year and adjusting withholding formulas so paychecks would start reflecting that right away.

Mr. Obama's advisers said they were still discussing with Congressional leaders the precise plan for phasing out the credit for wealthier Americans. They said no tax increases were included in the plan because it was focused on measures that create jobs. Obama aides have signaled that they will wait to let Mr. Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire in 2010, rather than try to repeal them sooner.

Likewise, other tax proposals Mr. Obama made in the campaign are not in the economic package because they are not aimed directly at job creation. Aides said the president-elect might return to those later on, possibly as early as the annual budget proposal he is to present in February.

""There are lots of priorities that are not included here, not because they are any less important in the long run but because we really want to stick to the principle that this is an economic recovery plan,"" one adviser said.

To encourage businesses to expand their work forces and operations, Mr. Obama wants a tax credit for each job created. During the campaign, he proposed $3,000 for each job. Advisers said he was now also trying to figure out a way to give incentives to businesses to resist cutting jobs, as so many have been doing.

The economic plan will also include other tax breaks intended to stir capital investment. The stimulus package Mr. Bush signed last year included a provision generally allowing businesses immediate depreciation of half of their spending in 2008 on new equipment, rather than spreading out that depreciation over years, reducing their immediate tax burdens. Mr. Obama's advisers said they were planning to build on that, either by extending it to investment in 2009 and 2010 or through some other mechanism.

The Obama plan would also allow businesses to apply net operating losses from last year to offset tax liabilities from prior years,enabling them to claim refunds from the government now in hopes of encouraging capital investment, much as was done in a 2002 economic stimulus plan.

Thank you, thank you.

My fellow citizens:

I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you've bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.

Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential Oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the Oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers [sic], and true to our founding documents.

So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.

That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.

These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable, but no less profound, is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights.

Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met.

On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.

On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.

We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to ""set aside childish things."" The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.

In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things -- some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.

For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.

For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.

For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.

Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.

This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.

For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.

All this we can do.

All this we will do.

Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.

What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.

Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control. The nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.

As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers -- Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience'[s] sake. And so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: Know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity. And we are ready to lead once more.

Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.

We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort -- even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you!

For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.

To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West -- know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those -- To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.

To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.

As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment -- a moment that will define a generation -- it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.

For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.

Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.

This is the price and the promise of citizenship.

This is the source of our confidence -- the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.

This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred Oath.

So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The Capitol was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:

    Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].

America: In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
","On a day rich in history, Barack Obama was sworn in Tuesday as the 44th U.S. president, urging Americans to persevere through the ""gathering clouds and raging storms"" of war and recession.

The inauguration of the first African-American to lead the world's most powerful country drew crowds well over one million to the National Mall here. In his 18-minute address, Mr. Obama called on Americans to return to the values of ""hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity"" that have seen the country through past crises.

With Mr. Obama's first day on the job scarcely begun, the financial uncertainty facing his presidency made itself felt. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4%, its worst inauguration-day performance in history, amid fresh signs of trouble among the nation's banks.

At exactly noon, by law, Mr. Obama became president. Placing his hand on a Bible once used by Abraham Lincoln, he took the oath using his full name, Barack Hussein Obama -- a moment that stood in contrast to episodes on the long campaign trail in which detractors would occasionally stress his middle name in a derogatory way.

Mr. Obama acknowledged the significance of his rise to power for a nation where race has long been a highly charged subtext. He linked his family's immigrant past -- his father, who hailed from Kenya, once herded goats -- to the legacy of segregation experienced by many of the thousands of African-Americans who came from around the country to witness his inauguration.

""A man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a sacred oath,"" Mr. Obama said.

Imperfection intruded briefly on an otherwise meticulously scripted day when Mr. Obama and Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had trouble getting through the oath of office. The two men briefly spoke over each other, then paused when the chief justice recited a few words out of sequence. The moment passed, and when the oath was completed, the Marine Corps band struck up ""Hail to the Chief.""

In the first policy act of the Obama administration, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel signed an order Tuesday afternoon stopping all pending regulations until the new White House can conduct fresh legal and policy reviews.

Today, on his first full day in office, Mr. Obama is expected to meet with his economic team as well as the architect of an Iraq war policy he once opposed, Gen. David Petraeus, to deliver the orders to begin withdrawing combat troops from Iraq.

Mr. Obama's rivals aren't standing down. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, faces a grilling later this week from the Senate Finance Committee over failure to pay some of his taxes. And on Tuesday, Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) delayed a vote to confirm Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, protesting the financial support her husband's charities and library have received from foreign governments.

On Day 1, Mr. Obama and his secretary of state will have to confront renewed tensions in the Arab world after Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip. The slow, 16-month withdrawal he plans for Iraq wouldn't end the nation's fighting but shift the focus to Afghanistan, where rising violence and chaos is threatening NATO's seven-year effort to stabilize the region. Mr. Obama has long said Pakistan is the primary threat to U.S. national security. Now, he has the chance to make good on his promise of renewed diplomacy there, and in Iran, a nation he has pledged to engage.

Up and down the National Mall, emotions ran high. Tim Waters, 41 years old, captured the mood of many when asked why he had made the 4 1/2-hour drive from his home in Pittsburgh.

""How could you miss this?"" he said. ""This is something you read books to your grandkids about.""

Inauguration Day, with all of its pomp and symbolism, culminated one of the most unlikely stories in American politics, not just the ascent of the first African-American president but the arrival of a politician who, just eight years ago, was turned away from the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles as a no-name state senator from the heartland.

Mr. Obama began the day at an emotional church service, and had coffee with outgoing President George W. Bush. Then, at a lunch following the noon swearing-in ceremony, he witnessed the collapse of one of his most powerful political benefactors, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D., Mass.), who is ill with a brain tumor.

The chief of neurology at the hospital where Sen. Kennedy was taken said in a statement that the collapse was likely prompted by fatigue. He said Sen. Kennedy was awake, talking with friends and feeling well.

Later in the day, Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama marched part of the distance up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House.

In his inaugural address, Mr. Obama leavened idealism with realism, reminding listeners that the nation is at war against ""those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents."" At the same time, he reached out to the global community, and in particular to the Muslim world, to ""seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect.""

On the economic front he promised ""action, bold and swift"" and took a jab at those ""who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.""

""The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works,"" Mr. Obama said.

He also issued subtle rebukes to the outgoing administration, without naming names. ""On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics,"" Mr. Obama said. ""The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit, to choose our better history.""

On foreign policy, he offered one of his sharpest criticisms. ""We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals,"" he said. On Wednesday, he is expected to issue an executive order to begin shutting the military prison at Guantanamo Bay and to move toward ending interrogation techniques he has called torture.

Mr. Obama's comments regarding the outgoing administration drew some Republican criticism. Sen. Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said the subtle slams on the opposition went over ""not well,"" adding that he felt they ""detracted from the overall high tone of the speech.""

But for the most part on Tuesday, Mr. Obama and Washington enjoyed a rare moment of harmony. Hundreds of thousands of people turned the city's streets and the expanse of green between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial into a party scene.

Mr. Obama faced a crowd that stretched as far as his eyes could see. In the distance, a mass of people waved flags, creating a landscape of shimmering color. A strong, biting wind kept the crowd shivering.

When asked what it meant to be present for the inauguration, Beverly Kirkland paused silently for nearly a minute while her eyes brimmed with tears. ""It's very emotional,"" she said. Ms. Kirkland, 64, was in Washington 45 years ago for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., declared, ""I have a dream.""

""This is really full circle to be able to be here today,"" Ms. Kirkland said.

Before Mr. Obama's address, the evangelical Rev. Rick Warren delivered an invocation. His selection angered liberals over antigay comments he has made, and Mr. Warren seemed aware of the divides as he addressed the crowd. ""Help us, oh God, to remember that we are Americans, united not by race or religion or blood, but to our commitment to freedom and justice for all,"" he said. ""When we fight each other, when we forget you, forgive us.""

Also on the program: a quartet including violinist Itzhak Perlman and cellist Yo-Yo Ma with a John Williams piece built on the melody to the Shaker hymn, ""Simple Gifts.""
","Barack Hussein Obama was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States on Tuesday and promised to ""begin again the work of remaking America"" on a day of celebration that climaxed a once-inconceivable journey for the man and his country.

Mr. Obama, the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas, inherited a White House built partly by slaves and a nation in crisis at home and abroad. The moment captured the imagination of much of the world as more than a million flag-waving people bore witness while Mr. Obama recited the oath with his hand on the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln used at his inauguration 148 years ago.

Beyond the politics of the occasion, the sight of a black man climbing the highest peak electrified people across racial, generational and partisan lines. Mr. Obama largely left it to others to mark the history explicitly, making only passing reference to his own barrier-breaking role in his 18-minute Inaugural Address, noting how improbable it might seem that ""a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.""

But confronted by the worst economic situation in decades, two overseas wars and the continuing threat of Islamic terrorism, Mr. Obama sobered the celebration with a grim assessment of the state of a nation rocked by home foreclosures, shuttered businesses, lost jobs, costly health care, failing schools, energy dependence and the threat of climate change. Signaling a sharp and immediate break with the presidency of George W. Bush, he vowed to usher in a ""new era of responsibility"" and restore tarnished American ideals.

""Today, I say to you that the challenges we face are real,"" Mr. Obama said in the address, delivered from the west front of the Capitol. ""They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America, they will be met.""

The vast crowd that thronged the Mall on a frigid but bright winter day was the largest to attend an inauguration in decades, if not ever. Many then lined Pennsylvania Avenue for a parade that continued well past nightfall on a day that was not expected to end for Mr. Obama until late in the night with the last of 10 inaugural balls.

Mr. Bush left the national stage quietly, doing nothing to upstage his successor. After hosting the Obamas for coffee at the White House and attending the ceremony at the Capitol, Mr. Bush hugged Mr. Obama, then left through the Rotunda to head back to Texas. ""Come on, Laura, we're going home,"" he was overheard telling Mrs. Bush.

The inauguration coincided with more bad news from Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 300 points on indications of further trouble for banks.

The spirit of the day was also marred by the hospitalization of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose endorsement helped propel Mr. Obama to the Democratic nomination last year. Mr. Kennedy, who has been fighting a malignant brain tumor, suffered a seizure at a Capitol luncheon after the ceremony and was wheeled out on a stretcher.

The pageantry included some serious business. Shortly after he and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were sworn in, Mr. Obama ordered all pending Bush regulations frozen for a legal and policy review. He also signed formal nomination papers for his cabinet, and the Senate quickly confirmed seven nominees: the secretaries of homeland security, energy, agriculture, interior, education and veterans' affairs and the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

When he arrives in the Oval Office on Wednesday, aides said, Mr. Obama will get to work on some of his priorities. He plans to convene his national security team and senior military commanders to discuss his plans to pull combat troops out of Iraq and bolster those in Afghanistan. He also plans to sign executive orders to start closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and could reverse Mr. Bush's restrictions on financing for groups that promote or provide information about abortion.

Delays in the confirmation process have left both the State Department and the Treasury Department in the hands of caretakers. But Hillary Rodham Clinton was expected to win Senate confirmation as secretary of state on Wednesday, and the Pentagon remains under the control of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who was kept on from the Bush administration and did not attend the inauguration so someone in the line of succession would survive in case of terrorist attack.

In his address, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Bush ""for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition."" But he also offered implicit criticism, condemning what he called ""our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.""

He went on to assure the rest of the world that change had come. ""To all other peoples and governments who are watching today,"" Mr. Obama said, ""from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born, know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more.""

Some of Mr. Obama's supporters booed and taunted Mr. Bush when he emerged from the Capitol to take his place on stage, at one point singing, ""Nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey, goodbye."" By day's end, Mr. Bush had landed in Texas, where he defended his presidency and declared that he was ""coming home with my head held high.""

The departing vice president, Dick Cheney, appeared at the ceremony in a wheelchair after suffering a back injury moving the day before and was also booed.

The nation's 56th inauguration drew waves of people from all corners and filled the expanse between the Capitol and the Washington Monument. For the first transition in power since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, much of the capital was under exceptionally tight security, with a two-square-mile swath under the strictest control. Bridges from Virginia were closed to regular traffic and more than 35,000 civilian and military personnel were on duty.

Mr. Obama secured at least part of his legacy the moment he walked into the White House on Tuesday, 146 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, 108 years after the first black man dined in the mansion with a president and 46 years after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. declared his dream of equality.

Mr. Obama, just 47 years old and four years out of the Illinois State Senate, arrived at this moment on the unlikeliest of paths, vaulted to the forefront of national politics on the strength of stirring speeches, early opposition to the Iraq war and public disenchantment with the Bush era. His scant record of achievement at the national level proved less important to voters than his embodiment of change.

His foreign-sounding name, his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia and his skin color made him a unique figure in the annals of presidential campaigns, yet he toppled two of the best brand names in American politics -- Mrs. Clinton in the primaries and Senator John McCain in the general election.

Mr. Obama himself is descended on his mother's side from ancestors who owned slaves and he can trace his family tree to Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. The power of the moment was lost on no one as the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, one of the towering figures of the civil rights movement, gave the benediction and called for ""inclusion, not exclusion; tolerance, not intolerance.""

The Rev. Rick Warren, a conservative minister selected by Mr. Obama to give the invocation despite protests from liberals, told the crowd, ""We know today that Dr. King and a great cloud of witnesses are shouting in heaven.""

For all that, Mr. Obama used the occasion to address ""this winter of our hardship"" and promote his plan for vast federal spending accompanied by tax cuts to stimulate the economy and begin addressing energy, environmental and infrastructure needs.

""Now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans,"" he said. ""Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what this country has already done, what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage.""

He also essentially renounced the curtailment of liberties in the name of security, saying he would ""reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."" He struck a stiff note on terrorism, saying Americans ""will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense.""

""For those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken,"" he said. ""You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.""

But Mr. Obama also added a message to Islamic nations, a first from the inaugural lectern. ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect,"" Mr. Obama said. ""To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history -- but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.""

Mr. Obama's public day started at 8:45 a.m. when he and his wife, Michelle, left Blair House for a service at St. John's Church, then joined the Bushes, Cheneys and Bidens for coffee at the White House.

The Obamas' daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, joined them at the Capitol, as did Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain, as well as former Presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and the elder George Bush.

While emotional for many, the ceremony did not go entirely according to plan. Mr. Biden was sworn in by Justice John Paul Stevens behind schedule at 11:57 a.m., and Mr. Obama did not take the oath until 12:05 p.m., five minutes past the constitutionally proscribed transfer of power.

Moreover, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. stumbled over the 35-word oath, causing Mr. Obama to repeat it out of the constitutional order. Instead of swearing that he ""will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States,"" Mr. Obama swore that he ""will execute the office of president of the United States faithfully.""

Following time-honored rituals, the Obamas attended lunch with lawmakers in Statuary Hall at the Capitol, then rode and walked to the White House, where they watched the parade from a bulletproof reviewing stand. They planned to attend all 10 official inaugural balls before spending their first night in the White House.

In his Inaugural Address, Mr. Obama seemed at times to be having a virtual dialogue with his predecessors. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility,"" he said, ""a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly."" Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton likewise called for responsibility at their inaugurations, but Mr. Obama offered little sense of what exactly he wanted Americans to do.

Mr. Obama also seemed to take issue with Ronald Reagan, who declared when he took office in 1981 that ""government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem."" Mr. Clinton rebutted that in 1997, saying, ""government is not the problem and government is not the solution.""

Mr. Obama offered a new formulation: ""The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works, whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end.""

Mr. Clinton, at least, applauded the message. In a brief interview afterward, he said Mr. Obama's installation could change the way America was viewed.

""It's obviously historic because President Obama is the first African-American president, but it's more than that,"" Mr. Clinton said. ""This is a time when we're clearly making a new beginning. It's a country of repeated second-chances and new beginnings.""

5,5,2009-04-02-G20Speech.txt,"Good afternoon, or good evening -- we're running a little bit late.

Earlier today, we finished a very productive summit that will be, I believe, a turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery.

By any measure, the London summit was historic.  It was historic because of the size and the scope of the challenges that we face, and because of the timeliness and magnitude of our response.

The challenge is clear.  The global economy is contracting. Trade is shrinking.  Unemployment is rising.  The international finance system is nearly frozen.  Even these facts can't fully capture the crisis that we're confronting, because behind them is the pain and uncertainty that so many people are facing.  We see it back in the United States.  We see it here in London.  We see it around the world:  families losing their homes, workers losing their jobs and their savings, students who are deferring their dreams.  So many have lost so much.  Just to underscore this point, back in the United States, jobless claims released today were the highest in 26 years.  We owe it to all of our citizens to act, and to act with a sense of urgency.

In an age where our economies are linked more closely than ever before, the whole world has been touched by this devastating downturn.  And today, the world's leaders have responded with an unprecedented set of comprehensive and coordinated actions.

Now, just keep in mind some historical context.  Faced with similar global challenges in the past, the world was slow to act, and people paid an enormous price.  That was true in the Great Depression, when nations prolonged and worsened the crisis by turning inward, waiting for more than a decade to meet the challenge together.  Even as recently as the 1980s, the slow global response deepened and widened a debt crisis in Latin America that pushed millions into poverty.

Today, we've learned the lessons of history.  I know that in the days leading up to the summit, some of you in the press, some commentators, confused honest and open debate with irreconcilable differences.  But after weeks of preparation, and two days of careful negotiation, we have agreed on a series of unprecedented steps to restore growth and prevent a crisis like this from happening again.

Let me outline what I think has been most significant.

Number one, we are committed to growth and job creation.  All G20 nations have acted to stimulate demand, which will total well over $2 trillion in global fiscal expansion.  The United States is also partnering with the private sector to clean out the troubled assets, the legacy assets that are crippling some banks, and using the full force of the government to ensure that our action leads directly to loans to businesses large and small, as well as individuals who depend on credit.  And these efforts will be amplified by our G20 partners, who are pursuing similarly comprehensive programs.

And we also agreed on bold action to support developing countries, so that we aren't faced with declining markets that the global economy depends on.  Together, the G20 is tripling the IMF's lending capacity and promoting lending by multilateral development banks to increase the purchasing power and expand markets in every country.

We've also rejected the protectionism that could deepen this crisis.  History tells us that turning inward can help turn a downturn into a depression.  And this cooperation between the world's leading economies signals our support for open markets, as does our multilateral commitment to trade finance that will grow our exports and create new jobs.

That's all on the growth front.

And next we made enormous strides in committing ourselves to comprehensive reform of a failed regulatory system.  And together, I believe that we must put an end to the bubble-and-bust economy that has stood in the way of sustained growth and enabled abusive risk-taking that endangers our prosperity.

At home, back in the States, our efforts began with the approach that Secretary Geithner proposed last week, the strongest regulatory reforms any nation has contemplated so far to prevent the massive failure of responsibility that we have already seen.  Today, these principles have informed and enabled the coordinated action that we will take with our G20 partners.

To prevent future crises, we agreed to increased transparency and capital protections for financial institutions. We're extending supervision to all systemically important institutions, markets and products, including hedge funds.  We'll identify jurisdictions that fail to cooperate, including tax havens, and take action to defend our financial system.  We will reestablish the Financial Stability Forum with a stronger mandate.  And we will reform and expand the IMF and World Bank so they are more efficient, effective and representative.

Finally, we are protecting those who don't always have a voice at the G20, but who have suffered greatly in this crisis.  And the United States is ready to lead in this endeavor.  In the coming days, I intend to work with Congress to provide $448 million in immediate assistance to vulnerable populations -- from Africa to Latin America -- and to double support for food safety to over $1 billion so that we are giving people the tools they need to lift themselves out of poverty.  We will also support the United Nations and World Bank as they coordinate the rapid assistance necessary to prevent humanitarian catastrophe.

I have to say, though, that this is not just charity.  These are all future markets for all countries, and future drivers of world economic growth.

Let me also underscore my appreciation to Prime Minister Brown, his entire team, and all my colleagues from around the world who contributed to the summit's success.  You know, it's hard for 20 heads of state to bridge their differences.  We've all got our own national policies; we all have our own assumptions, our own political cultures.  But our citizens are all hurting.  They all need us to come together.  So I'm pleased that the G20 has agreed to meet again this fall, because I believe that this is just the beginning.  Our problems are not going to be solved in one meeting; they're not going to be solved in two meetings.  We're going to have to be proactive in shaping events and persistent in monitoring our progress to determine whether further action is needed.

I also want to just make a few remarks about additional meetings I had outside of the G20 context.  While here in London I had the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with leaders of Russia, China, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and India, as well as Great Britain.  And these discussions were extraordinarily valuable and productive.  Of course, we spoke about additional steps to promote economic recovery and growth.  But we also discussed coordinated actions on a range of issues:  how we could reduce the nuclear threat; how we could forge a coordinated response to North Korea's planned missile launch; how we can turn back terrorism and stabilize Afghanistan; how we can protect our planet from the scourge of climate change.  I'm encouraged that we laid the groundwork for real and lasting progress on a host of these issues.

Ultimately, the challenges of the 21st century can't be met without collective action.  Agreement will almost never be easy, and results won't always come quickly.  But I am committed to respecting different points of view, and to forging a consensus instead of dictating our terms.  That's how we made progress in the last few days.  And that's how we will advance and uphold our ideals in the months and years to come.

You know, at home, I've often spoken about a new era of responsibility.  And I believe strongly that this era must not end at our borders.  In a world that's more and more interconnected, we all have responsibilities to work together to solve common challenges.  And although it will take time, I am confident that we will rebuild global prosperity if we act with a common sense of purpose, persistence, and the optimism that the moment demands.

So I appreciate your attention, and I'm going to take a few questions.  I've got a list of a few people I'm going to call on and then I will intersperse some folks I'm calling on randomly.
","President Barack Obama had more success with former Cold War combatants than with some European allies as the Group of 20 summit of world leaders began, starting new talks on arms and trade with Russia and China but facing a challenge from France and Germany over economic leadership.

Mr. Obama began by conceding U.S. culpability in starting the global financial crisis, but also called on Europe and others to do more to end it, in an opening news conference with the summit host, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel answered just hours later with a combative appearance of their own, demanding fast and strict international regulation of the world financial system; Mr. Sarkozy called it ""nonnegotiable.""

They warned against an empty conclusion of the conference despite many disputes over its direction. Chief among them are French and German calls for fast and far-reaching financial regulation, while the U.S. has stressed stimulus plans and argued for a lighter regulatory approach to some parts of the financial world, particularly hedge funds.

""We do not want results that have no impact in practice,"" said Ms. Merkel. ""Germany and France will speak with one and the same voice,"" Mr. Sarkozy added, citing an on-and-off political alliance that has previously pitted the two countries against the U.S. or the U.K. over Europe's direction. ""As the chancellor rightly said, we demand results,"" he said. ""Regulation is not simply a word, an empty word . . . It is a major objective.""

Of the U.S. president, he said, ""Mr. Obama was elected on change. We trust him. But we're talking about today and tomorrow. . . . After tomorrow will be too late.""

The summit of 20 industrial and developing nations is still expected to produce some substantive accords. Mr. Brown said participants will pledge $100 billion ""at an absolute minimum"" to finance international trade, which has dropped off precipitously. On economic stimulus, members will pledge to do whatever is necessary, though without setting targets the U.S. has sought and already been forced to abandon amid European resistance.

A communique will lay out broad principles to remake the global financial regulatory system and rein in tax havens, with the International Monetary Fund -- whose lending powers would be expanded -- and a strengthened Financial Stability Forum empowered to police them. The communique also will include the establishment of so-called regulatory colleges to help coordinate supervision of the world's biggest banks, and strong language against protectionism. There also is likely to be language on principles to guide banks on how they calculate staff bonuses.

But the outcome is a step toward solving the financial crisis -- rather than a solution itself. Mr. Obama said he was ""confident"" of consensus and added that ""the separation between the various parties involved has been vastly overstated."" Mr. Brown struck a less sanguine note. ""We have some tough negotiations ahead,"" he said to reporters. ""It will not be easy.""

The French and German leaders seemed resolute that divisions among the players would not be papered over. Both -- like Mr. Obama and Mr. Brown -- also are seeking roles as international leaders to help their political status in presiding over troubled economies at home.

Mr. Brown has pushed a new Bretton Woods-type system of global financial oversight, while Mr. Obama has stressed the importance of a spending boost alongside stronger rules to protect the financial system from abuse. French and German officials have made a point of stressing the role of lightly regulated U.S. financial institutions in spurring a problem that then enveloped Europe, a point Mr. Sarkozy repeated yesterday.

""Compromise has to be engaged in by all parts of the world, all regions of the world,"" he said, adding pointedly: ""The crisis didn't actually spontaneously erupt in Europe, did it?""

Hoping to disarm G-20 members looking for someone to blame, Mr. Obama accepted some American responsibility. ""If you look at the source of this crisis, the United States certainly has some accounting to do with respect to a regulatory system that was inadequate,"" he said during the joint news conference with Mr. Brown.

Yet he warned that the world can't rely on the U.S. to drive global growth. ""It can't just be the United States as the engine, everybody is going to have to pick up the pace,"" he said.

After Mr. Obama's meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the two pledged a ""reset"" of recently contentious relations, promising to produce a new arms-reduction treaty and pursue a ""nuclear-free world.""

In Mr. Obama's meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao, the leaders agreed to create a new ""U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue,"" going beyond the twice-yearly forum during the Bush administration. The effort will add security and other issues, according to people familiar with the matter. The White House said it would be led on the U.S. side by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.

The meeting with Mr. Hu was described as businesslike by senior White House officials, who said the main hot-button issue -- Beijing's suggestion that a new global currency replace the dollar -- didn't come up. Mr. Hu invited Mr. Obama to China, a visit the U.S. president set for the latter half of the year.

More contentious was the renewed French-German alliance that continued to bedevil calls for G-20 unity. Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel warned the G-20 meeting won't do enough to solve the world's financial problems. ""We sometimes like to sweep things under the carpet -- not actually tackling matters at the root cause,"" Ms. Merkel said.

Both leaders called for establishing a new regulatory structure that would mean tougher rules for banks and hedge funds. In their minds, Mr. Sarkozy said, the G-20 meeting in November in Washington established principles. The London summit, the French president said, needed to yield concrete plans. Stimulus attempts are a good way to restart the global economy, he said, but regulation has to be improved.

Credit-ratings agencies were one target. Mr. Sarkozy expressed disdain for the fact that securities rated triple-A can fall to triple-B in a short period of time. The leaders' comments were broad, but Mr. Sarkozy offered one specific goal: that banks retain some of the loans that they bundle into securities and sell to investors in a process known as securitization. ""We want traceability,"" Mr. Sarkozy, adding: ""A bank that engages in securitization should keep on its balance sheet a part of what it has securitized.""

Despite the posturing, White House officials suggested the two sides weren't far apart on key issues. One senior administration official said the French are in line with the U.S. position on tax havens. Mr. Obama spoke specifically of new regulations coming for financial firms, derivatives markets and off-balance-sheet vehicles, and in producing language that will reject protectionism and put forward the agendas of emerging markets.

Changes in the U.S. financial infrastructure could take time wending through Congress, however. Changing the way the ratings agencies review complex securities could face an especially lengthy overview.

White House officials emphasized that the president was striving for substance, not theater. ""We don't do drive-by summits,"" a senior administration official said.

But pomp played its part, especially as Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama had an audience with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. The Obamas presented the queen with an iPod loaded with footage of her last visit to the U.S. and gave her a rare song book autographed by American composer Richard Rodgers.

That continued a multimedia theme started this winter when the president presented Mr. Brown with a set of DVDs, a gift deemed insufficient by the British press. The queen gave the Obamas a framed photograph of herself and the Duke of Edinburgh.
","In his debut on the international stage, President Obama presented himself as the leader of an America that can no longer go it alone, and as abiding by the protocol of a global new deal.

It was a performance that ranged from mediating behind closed doors -- Mr. Obama personally intervened in a spat between the French and Chinese leaders -- to a carefully calculated news conference in which he reached deep into history, showed contrition for the failings of Wall Street, and forecast a road the world could no longer travel. Gone are the days, from Pax Britannica to Pax Americana, when Britain and the United States made the rules that others followed.

""If there's just Roosevelt and Churchill sitting in a room with a brandy, that's an easier negotiation,"" Mr. Obama said during his hourlong meeting with the international news media, during which he called on reporters from India and China to ask him questions. ""But that's not the world we live in, and it shouldn't be the world that we live in.""

After more than 11 hours of meetings, Mr. Obama emerged Thursday from his first summit meeting with a handful of modest concrete commitments. He did not get much of what American officials had been hoping for, notably failing to persuade other countries to commit to more fiscal stimulus spending.

But he, along with the other world leaders present, did get a more forceful and detailed blueprint for a global recovery than a similar gathering 86 years ago, when an earlier generation failed to take collective action to counter the Great Depression. ""By being willing to accommodate European leaders on the need for better regulation of financial markets and emerging market leaders on their desire to have less protectionism,"" said Eswar S. Prasad, a former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Obama ""has certainly guided the G-20 leaders to a positive outcome.""

""All in all, not a bad day's work,"" Mr. Prasad added.

Mr. Obama's own assessment? ""Well, I think I did O.K.,"" he said, when asked by a reporter during a news conference to rate his performance.

In a premiere diplomatic tour that has already been scrutinized for every blemish, Mr. Obama has, thus far, gotten some not-so-good reviews -- several European news outlets complained that he seemed aloof -- and some raves. (President Nicolas Sarkozy of France called him ""very helpful."")

Mr. Sarkozy was referring to Mr. Obama the mediator. For a tense hour on Thursday, Mr. Sarkozy and President Hu Jintao of China were going back and forth about tax havens. In a large conference room at the Excel Center, surrounded by 18 other world leaders, the two men sniped at each other, according to officials in the room.

Mr. Sarkozy wanted the big communique produced by the Group of 20 to endorse naming and shaming global tax havens, maybe even including Hong Kong and Macao, which are under China's sovereignty. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Hu was having none of it. He appeared angry that Mr. Sarkozy was effectively accusing China of lax regulation, and that the French leader was asking China to endorse sanctions issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of wealthy nations that Beijing has yet to join.

According to accounts provided by White House officials and corroborated by European and other officials also in the room, Mr. Obama escorted both men, one at a time, to a corner of the room, to judge the dispute. How about replacing the word ""recognize,"" Mr. Obama suggested, with the word ""note?""

The result: ""The era of banking secrecy is over,"" the final communique said. ""We note that the O.E.C.D. has today published a list of countries assessed by the Global Forum against the international standard for exchange of tax information."" Hong Kong and Macao did not appear on the list.

It was not a Middle East peace accord. But Mr. Obama had his first moment as a statesman.

For the news conference that followed, Mr. Obama took pains to project a cheerful, humble image to a world still alternately enraged and befuddled by a financial crisis that originated with American subprime loans. He called on reporters from other countries -- ""foreign,"" he said, before adding with a grin that they were foreign only to him. He bantered, dispensing with his propensity to filibuster and lecture.

Answering a question from a reporter from China, Mr. Obama managed to acknowledge that he had to care most about how American workers and companies were affected by globalization, while still making the argument for why globalization was in America's best interest.

""Look, I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the president of China,"" Mr. Obama said. Then he added, ""It is also my responsibility to lead America into recognizing that its interests, its fate, is tied up with the larger world.""

Mr. Obama said that if America neglected or abandoned poor countries, ""not only are we depriving ourselves of potential opportunities for markets and economic growth, but ultimately that despair may turn to violence that turns on us.""

""Unless we are concerned about the education of all children and not just our children, not only may we be depriving ourselves of the next great scientist who's going to find the next new energy source that saves the planet, but we also may make people around the world much more vulnerable to anti-American propaganda.""

In a rare show of emotion from the international press, many in the room stood up and cheered after Mr. Obama was done.

If Mr. Obama gauged that crowd just right, he also had a few gaffes. The Obamas gave Queen Elizabeth II an iPod loaded with songs and videos -- this after weeks of grief from the British press over the 25 DVDs that the couple gave Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain when he visited Washington. (The Browns gave the Obamas an ornate penholder made from the timber of a Victorian antislave ship.)

And Michelle Obama, during the meeting with the queen, touched her, raising already high-brows over on this side of the pond. Buckingham Palace protocol says that commoners must not touch the queen, a dictate that foreign leaders in the past have ignored at their own peril. When Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia did the same thing back in 1992 the newspapers here called him the ""Lizard of Oz.""

But so high is the adulation that has been heaped on the Obamas from the normally caustic British press since their arrival that newspapers here said it was a sign of how well Mrs. Obama got along with the queen. In Mrs. Obama's defense, the queen did touch her first, putting her arm around her as the two looked down at their feet, presumably talking about shoes.

6,6,2009-04-15-ANewFoundation.txt,"Well, to President DeGioia, thank you so much for the gracious introduction, and thanks for bringing your family -- including JT -- appreciate you. We're going to invite him over, hang out with the girls. He's a pretty good-looking young man.

To Mayor Adrian Fenty, who's doing such a great job in this city, thank you so much for your attendance. To Representative Donna Edwards, who is here and represents Maryland's 4th District, thank you.

To Georgetown University students, it is great to be here. Well, it is good to be back. I appeared in this room during the campaign and had a wonderful reception then, and it's wonderful to be back and be with all of you.

We're going to talk about the economy today. And I was telling President DeGioia this may be a slightly longer speech than I usually give, but it's a slightly bigger topic, and that is how we are going to deal with so many of our economic challenges.

You know, it's been 12 weeks now since my administration began. And I think that even our critics would agree that at the very least, we've been busy. In just under three months, we've responded to an extraordinary set of economic challenges with extraordinary action -- action that's been unprecedented both in terms of its scale and its speed.

And I know that some have accused us of taking on too much at once. Others believe we haven't done enough. And many Americans are simply wondering how all of our different programs and policies fit together in a single, overarching strategy that will move this economy from recession to recovery and ultimately to prosperity.

So today, I want to step back for a moment and explain our strategy as clearly as I can. This is going to be prose, and not poetry. I want to talk about what we've done, why we've done it, and what we have left to do. I want to update you on the progress we've made, but I also want to be honest about the pitfalls that may still lie ahead.

Most of all, I want every American to know that each action we take and each policy we pursue is driven by a larger vision of America's future -- a future where sustained economic growth creates good jobs and rising incomes; a future where prosperity is fueled not by excessive debt, or reckless speculation, or fleeting profits, but is instead built by skilled, productive workers, by sound investments that will spread opportunity at home and allow this nation to lead the world in the technologies and the innovation and discoveries that will shape the 21st century. That's the America I see. That's the America that Georgetown is preparing so many of you for. That is the future that I know that we can have.

Now, to understand how we get there, we first need to understand how we got here.

Recessions are not uncommon. Markets and economies naturally ebb and flow, as we've seen many times in our history. But this recession is different. This recession was not caused by a normal downturn in the business cycle. It was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street.

As has been widely reported, it started in the housing market. During the course of the decade, the formula for buying a house changed: Instead of saving their pennies to buy their dream house, many Americans found that suddenly they could take out loans that by traditional standards their incomes just could not support. Others were tricked into signing these subprime loans by lenders who were trying to make a quick profit. The reason these loans were so readily available was that Wall Street saw big profits to be made. Investment banks would buy and package together these questionable mortgages into securities, arguing that by pooling the mortgages the risks had somehow been reduced. And credit agencies that are supposed to help investors determine the soundness of various investments stamped the securities with their safest rating when they should have been labeled ""Buyer Beware.""

No one really knew what the actual value of these securities were, no one fully understood what the risks were. But since the housing market was booming and prices were rising, banks and investors just kept buying and selling them, always passing off the risk to someone else for a greater profit without having to take any of the ultimate responsibility. Banks took on more debt than they could handle.

The government-chartered companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose traditional mandate was to help support traditional mortgages, decided to get in on the action by buying and holding billions of dollars of these securities. AIG, the biggest insurer in the world that had a very traditional insurance business that was very profitable, decided to make profits suddenly by selling billions of dollars of complicated financial instruments that supposedly insured these securities. Everybody was making record profits -- except the wealth created was real only on paper. And as the bubble grew, there was almost no accountability or oversight from anyone in Washington.

Then the housing bubble burst. Home prices fell. People began to default on their subprime mortgages. And the value of all those loans and securities plummeted. Banks and investors couldn't find anyone to buy them. Greed gave way to fear. Investors pulled their money out of the market. Large financial institutions that didn't have enough money on hand to pay off all their obligations collapsed. Other banks held on tight to their money and simply stopped lending.

Now, this is when the crisis spread from Wall Street to Main Street. After all, the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to, as you all know very well, a college education. It's how stores stock their shelves, and farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll. So when banks stopped lending money, businesses started laying off workers. When laid-off workers had less money to spend, businesses were forced to lay off even more workers. When people couldn't get a car loan, a bad situation at the auto companies became even worse. When people couldn't get home loans, the crisis in the housing market only deepened. Because the infected securities were being traded worldwide and other nations also had weak regulations, this recession soon became global. And when other nations can't afford to buy our goods, it slows our economy even further.

So this is the situation, the downward spiral that we confronted on the day that we took office. So our most urgent task has been to clear away the wreckage, repair the immediate damage to the economy, and do everything we can to prevent a larger collapse. And since the problems we face are all working off each other to feed a vicious economic downturn, we've had no choice but to attack all fronts of our economic crisis simultaneously.

The first step was to fight a severe shortage of demand in the economy. So the Federal Reserve did this by dramatically lowering interest rates last year in order to boost investment. My administration and Congress boosted demand by passing the largest recovery plan in our nation's history. It's a plan that's already in the process of saving or creating 3.5 million jobs over the next two years. It's putting money directly into people's pockets with a tax cut for 95 percent of working families that's now showing up in paychecks across America. And to cushion the blow of this recession, we also provided extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own.

Now, you will recall that some argued this recovery plan is a case of irresponsible government spending, that it's somehow to blame for our long-term deficit projections, and that the federal government should be cutting instead of increasing spending right now. So I want to tackle this argument head on.

To begin with, economists on both the left and the right agree that the last thing a government should do in the middle of a recession is to cut back on spending. You see, when this recession began, many families sat around the kitchen table and tried to figure out where they could cut back. And so have many businesses. And this is a completely reasonable and understandable reaction. But if everybody -- if everybody -- if every family in America, if every business in America cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money, which means there are no customers, which means there are more layoffs, which means the economy gets even worse. That's why the government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to stimulate demand. That's exactly what we're doing right now.

Second, I absolutely agree that our long-term deficit is a major problem that we have to fix. But the fact is that this recovery plan represents only a tiny fraction of that long-term deficit. As I'll discuss in a moment, the key to dealing with our long-term deficit and our national debt is to get a handle on out-of-control health care costs -- not to stand idly by as the economy goes into free fall.

So the recovery plan has been the first step in confronting this economic crisis. The second step has been to heal our financial system so that credit is once again flowing to the businesses and families who rely on it.

The heart of this financial crisis is that too many banks and other financial institutions simply stopped lending money. In a climate of fear, banks were unable to replace their losses from some of those bad mortgages by raising new capital on their own, and they were unwilling to lend the money they did have because they were afraid that no one would pay it back. It's for this reason that the last administration used what they called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, to provide these banks with temporary financial assistance in order to get them lending again.

Now, I understand that TARP is not popular, and I have to say that I don't agree with some of the ways the TARP program was managed, but I do agree with the broader rationale that we must provide banks with the capital and the confidence necessary to start lending again. That's the purpose of the stress tests that will soon tell us how much additional capital will be needed to support lending at our largest banks. Ideally, these needs will be met by private investors who are willing to put in money to these banks. But where that's not possible, and banks require substantial additional resources from the government, then we will hold accountable those who are responsible, we'll force the necessary adjustments, we'll provide the support to clean up those bank balance sheets, and we will assure the continuity of a strong and viable institution that can serve our people and our economy.

Of course, there are some who differ with our approach. On the one hand, there are some who argue that the government should stand back and simply let these banks fail -- especially since in many cases it was their bad decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place. But whether we like it or not, history has shown repeatedly that when nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again, they have crises that last years and years instead of months and months -- years of low growth, years of low job creation, years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more than a course of bold, upfront action.

And although there are a lot of Americans who understandably think that government money would be better spent going directly to families and businesses instead of to banks -- one of my most frequent questions in the letters that I get from constituents is, ""Where's my bailout?"" -- and I understand the sentiment. It makes sense intuitively, and morally it makes sense, but the truth is that a dollar of capital in a bank can actually result in $8 or $10 of loans to families and businesses. So that's a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth. That's why we have to fix the banks.

Now, on the other hand, there have been some who don't dispute that we need to shore up the banking system, but they suggest that we've been too timid in how we go about it. This is essentially the nationalization argument that some of you may have heard. And the argument says that the federal government should have already preemptively stepped in and taken over major financial institutions the way that the FDIC currently intervenes in smaller banks, and that our failure, my administration's failure to do so is yet another example of Washington coddling Wall Street -- ""Why aren't you tougher on the banks?""

So let me be clear: The reason we have not taken this step has nothing to do with any ideological or political judgment we've made about government involvement in banks. It's certainly not because of any concern we have for the management and shareholders whose actions helped to cause this mess. Rather, it's because we believe that preemptive government takeovers are likely to end up costing taxpayers even more in the end, and because it's more likely to undermine than create confidence.

Governments should practice the same principle as doctors: First, do no harm. So rest assured -- we will do whatever is necessary to get credit flowing again, but we will do so in ways that minimize risks to taxpayers and to the broader economy. To that end, in addition to the program to provide capital to the banks, we've launched a plan that will pair government resources with private investment in order to clear away the old loans and securities -- the so-called toxic assets -- that are also preventing our banks from lending money.

Now, what we've also learned during this crisis is that our banks aren't the only institutions affected by these toxic assets that are clogging the financial system. AIG, for example, is not a bank, it's an insurance company, as I mentioned -- and yet because it chose to insure billions of dollars worth of risky assets, essentially creating a hedge fund on top of an insurance company, its failure could threaten the entire financial system and freeze lending even more. And that's why, as frustrating as it is -- and I promise you, nobody is more frustrated than me with AIG -- I promise -- we had to provide support for AIG, because the entire system, as fragile as it is, could be profoundly endangered if AIG went into a liquidation bankruptcy.

It's also why we need new legal authority so that we have the power to intervene in such financial institutions, the same way that bankruptcy courts currently do with businesses that hit hard times but don't pose systemic risks -- and that way we can restructure these businesses in an orderly way that doesn't induce panic in the financial system -- and, by the way, will allow us to restructure inappropriate bonus contracts without creating a perception the government can just change compensation rules on a whim.

This is also why we're moving aggressively to unfreeze markets and jumpstart lending outside the banking system, where more than half of all lending in America actually takes place. To do this, we've started a program that will increase guarantees for small business loans and unlock the market for auto loans and student loans. And to stabilize the housing market, we've launched a plan that will save up to four million responsible homeowners from foreclosure and help many millions more to refinance their homes.

In a few weeks, we will also reassess the state of Chrysler and General Motors, two companies with an important place in our history and a large footprint in our economy -- but two companies that have also fallen on hard times.

Late last year, the companies were given transitional loans by the previous administration to tide them over as they worked to develop viable business plans. Unfortunately, the plans they developed fell short, so we've given them some additional time to work these complex issues through. And by the way, we owed that not to the executives whose bad bets contributed to the weakening of their companies, but to the hundreds of thousands of workers whose livelihoods hang in the balance -- entire towns, entire communities, entire states are profoundly impacted by what happens in the auto industry.

Now, it is our fervent hope that in the coming weeks, Chrysler will find a viable partner and GM will develop a business plan that will put it on a path to profitability without endless support from American taxpayer. In the meantime, we're taking steps to spur demand for American cars and provide relief for autoworkers and their communities. And we will continue to reaffirm this nation's commitment to a 21st-century American auto industry that creates new jobs and builds the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward a clean-energy future.

Finally, to coordinate a global response to this global recession, I went to the meeting of the G20 nations in London the other week. Each nation has undertaken significant stimulus to spur demand. All agreed to pursue tougher regulatory reforms. We also agreed to triple the lending capacity of the International Monetary Fund -- which, as many of you know, is an international financial institution supported by all the major economies -- so that they can provide direct assistance to developing nations and vulnerable populations. That's not just charity; because America's success depends on whether other nations have the ability to buy what we sell, it's important that we pay attention to these emerging markets.

We pledged to avoid the trade barriers and protectionism that hurts us all in the end. And we decided to meet again in the fall to gauge our progress and take additional steps if necessary.

So that's where we've been, that's what we've done in the last three months. All of these actions -- the Recovery Act, the bank capitalization program, the housing plan, the strengthening of the non-bank credit market, the auto plan, and our work at the G20 -- all have been necessary pieces of the recovery puzzle. They've been designed to increase aggregate demand to get credit flowing again to families and businesses and to help families and businesses ride out the storm. And taken together, these actions are starting to generate signs of economic progress.

Because of our recovery plan, schools and police departments have cancelled planned layoffs; clean energy companies and construction companies are re-hiring workers to build everything from energy-efficient windows to new roads and highways. Our housing plan has helped lead to a spike in the number of homeowners who are taking advantage of historically-low mortgage rates by refinancing, which is like putting a $2,000 tax cut in your pocket. Our program to support the market for auto loans and student loans has started to unfreeze this market and securitize more of this lending in the last few weeks. And small businesses are seeing a jump in loan activity for the first time in months.

Now, this is all welcome and encouraging news. It does not mean the hard times are over; 2009 will continue to be a difficult year for America's economy, and obviously, most difficult for those who've lost their jobs. The severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more foreclosures, and more pain before it ends. The market will continue to rise and fall. Credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it should. The process for restructuring AIG and the auto companies will involve difficult and sometimes unpopular choices; we are not finished yet on that front. And all of this means that there's much more work to be done. But all of this also means that you can continue to expect an unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort from this administration to fight for economic recovery on all fronts.

But even as we continue to clear away the wreckage and address the immediate crisis, it is my firm belief that our next task, beginning now, is to make sure such a crisis never happens again. Even as we clean up balance sheets and get credit flowing again, even as people start spending and businesses start hiring -- all that's going to happen -- we have to realize that we cannot go back to the bubble-and-bust economy that led us to this point.

It is simply not sustainable to have a 21st-century financial system that is governed by 20th-century rules and regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the entire economy. It is not sustainable to have an economy where in one year, 40 percent of our corporate profits came from a financial sector that was based on inflated home prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks and overvalued assets. It's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while the typical working household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2,000. That's just not a sustainable model for long-term prosperity.

For even as too many were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits over the last decade, we continued to neglect the long-term threats to our prosperity: the crushing burden that the rising cost of health care is placing on families and businesses; the failure of our education system to prepare our workers for a new age; the progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries and technologies while we -- we remain addicted to foreign oil; the growing debt that we're passing on to our children. Even after we emerge from the current recession, these challenges will still represent major obstacles that stand in the way of our success in the 21st century. So we've got a lot of work to do.

Now, there's a parable at the end of the Sermon on the Mount that tells the story of two men. The first built his house on a pile of sand, and it was soon destroyed when a storm hit. But the second is known as the wise man, for when ""the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.""

It was founded upon a rock. We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand. We must build our house upon a rock. We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest; where we consume less at home and send more exports abroad.

It's a foundation built upon five pillars that will grow our economy and make this new century another American century: Number one, new rules for Wall Street that will reward drive and innovation, not reckless risk-taking; number two, new investments in education that will make our workforce more skilled and competitive; number three, new investments in renewable energy and technology that will create new jobs and new industries; number four, new investments in health care that will cut costs for families and businesses; and number five, new savings in our federal budget that will bring down the debt for future generations.

That's the new foundation we must build. That's our house built upon a rock. That must be our future -- and my administration's policies are designed to achieve that future.

Let me talk about each of these steps in turn. The first step we will take to build this foundation is to reform the outdated rules and regulations that allowed this crisis to happen in the first place. It is time to lay down tough new rules of the road for Wall Street to ensure that we never find ourselves here again. Just as after the Great Depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation that helped to create the depression, so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules: create rules that punish shortcuts and abuse; rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance --- a novel concept; rules that protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k). So we've already begun to work with Congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatory framework -- and I expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is out.

The second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our workers for a 21st century economy. You know, in the 20th century, the G.I. Bill helped send a generation to college. For decades we led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence we led the world in economic growth. But in this new economy, we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educational achievement, in the production of scientists and engineers. That's why we have set a goal that will greatly enhance our ability to compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century: By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. That is the goal that we have set and we intend to do.

To meet that goal, we have to start early. So we've already dramatically expanded early childhood education. We are investing in innovative programs that have proven to help schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps. We're creating new rewards that tie teachers' performance and new pathways for advancement. And I've asked every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training, and we have provided tax credits to make a college education more affordable for every American, even those who attend Georgetown.

And, by the way, one of the changes that I would like to see -- and I'm going to be talking about this in weeks to come -- is once again seeing our best and our brightest commit themselves to making things -- engineers, scientists, innovators. For so long, we have placed at the top of our pinnacle folks who can manipulate numbers and engage in complex financial calculations. And that's good, we need some of that. But you know what we can really use is some more scientists and some more engineers, who are building and making things that we can export to other countries.

Now, the third pillar of this new foundation is to harness the renewable energy that can create millions of new jobs and new industries. We all know that the country that harnesses this new energy source will lead the 21st century. Yet we've allowed other countries to outpace us on this race to the future. I don't know about you, but I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders. I think it's time for America to lead again.

So the investments we made in the Recovery Act will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in the next three years. And we are putting Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions on our energy bills and grow our economy at the same time.

Now, the only though that we can truly spark the transformation that's need is through a gradual, market-based cap on carbon pollution, so that clean energy is the profitable kind of energy.

There are those who've argued that we shouldn't attempt, we shouldn't even be thinking, we shouldn't even be talking about such a transition until the economy recovers. And they are right that we have to take into account the costs of transition. Transitioning to a clean energy economy will not be easy. But we can no longer delay putting a framework for a clean energy economy in place. That needs to be done now.

If businesses and entrepreneurs know today that we are closing this carbon pollution loophole, they'll start investing in clean energy now. And pretty soon, we'll see more companies constructing solar panels, and workers building wind turbines, and car companies manufacturing fuel-efficient cars. Investors will put some money into a new energy technology, and a small business will open to start selling it. That's how we can grow this economy, enhance our security, and protect our planet at the same time.

Now, the fourth pillar of our new foundation is a 21st century health care system where families, businesses and government budgets aren't dragged down by skyrocketing insurance premiums. One and a half million Americans could lose their homes this year just because of a medical crisis. Major American corporations are struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts. Small businesses are closing their doors. We can't allow the cost of health care to continue strangling our economy.

And that's why our Recovery Act will invest in electronic health records with strict privacy standards that can save money and lives and reduce medical error. That's why we've made the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep costs under control. And included in the budgets that just passed Congress is an historic commitment to reform that will finally make quality health care affordable for every American. So I'm looking forward in the next few months to working with both parties in Congress to make this reform a reality. We can get this done -- and we have to get it done.

Now, fixing our health care system will -- will require resources; it's not going to be free. But in my budget we've made a commitment to fully pay for reform without increasing the deficit, and we've identified specific savings that will make the health care system more efficient and reduce costs for us all.

In fact, we've undertaken an unprecedented effort to find this kind of savings in every corner of the budget, because the final pillar in building our new foundation is restoring fiscal discipline once this economy recovers.

Already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade. We need to do more, but we've already done that. We've announced procurement reform that will greatly reduce no-bid contracts and save the government $40 billion. We need to do more, but that's an important start. Secretary Gates recently announced a courageous set of reforms that go right at the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and cost overruns that have bloated our defense budget without making America safer. We need to do more, but that proposal by Secretary Gates is right on target. We will end education programs that don't work, we will root out waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program.

Altogether, this budget will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share of the economy by more than 10 percent over the next decade to the lowest level we've seen since we began keeping records nearly half a century ago. And as we continue to go through the federal budget line by line, we will be announcing additional savings, secured by eliminating and consolidating programs that we don't need so we can make room for the things that we do need.

That's what we're doing now. Of course, I realize that for some, this isn't enough. I know there's a criticism out there that my administration has been spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agenda while mortgaging our children's future. You've heard the argument.

Well, let me make three points. First, as I said earlier, the worst thing that we could do in a recession this severe is to try to cut government spending at the same time as families and businesses around the world are cutting back on their spending. So as serious as our deficit and debt problems are -- and they are very serious -- major efforts to deal with them have to focus on the medium and long-term budget picture, not on the short-term. And that's exactly what we've done.

Second, in tackling the deficit issue, we simply cannot sacrifice the long-term investments that we so desperately need to generate long-term prosperity. That's the argument that some critics have made: Well, you're proposing health care reform, you shouldn't be doing that; you're proposing education investments, you shouldn't be doing that, that adds to the deficit.

Look, just as a cash-strapped family may cut back on all kinds of luxuries, but will still insist on spending money to get their children through college, will refuse to have their kids drop out of college and go to work in some fast-food place, even though that might bring in some income in the short-term, because they're thinking about the long term -- so we as a country have to make current choices with an eye for the future.

If we don't invest now in renewable energy, if we don't invest now in a skilled workforce, if we don't invest now in a more affordable health care system, this economy simply won't grow at the pace it needs to in two or five or 10 years down the road. If we don't lay this new foundation now, it won't be long before we're right back where we are today. And I can assure you that chronically slow growth will not help our long-term budget situation. That's the second point.

Third point, the problem with our deficit and debt is not new. It has been building dramatically over the past eight years, largely because big tax cuts combined with increased spending on two wars and the increased costs of government health care programs have pushed it ever upwards. This structural gap in our budget, between the amount of money that's coming in and the amount of money that's going out, will only get worse as the baby boomers age, and will in fact lead us down an unsustainable path.

But let's not kid ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a few earmarks or cutting the budget for the National Endowment for the Arts. That's just not true. Along with defense and interest on the national debt, the biggest cost drivers in our budget are entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security -- all of which get more and more expensive every year. So if we want to get serious about fiscal discipline, and I do, then we're going to not only have to trim waste out of our discretionary budget -- which we've already begun -- we will also have to get serious about entitlement reform.

Now, nothing will be more important to this goal than passing health care reform that brings down costs across the system, including in Medicare and Medicaid. So make no mistake, health care reform is entitlement reform. That's not just my opinion -- that was the conclusion of a wide range of participants at the Fiscal Responsibility Summit that we held at the White House in February. And that's one of the reasons why I firmly believe we need to get health care reform done this year.

Once we tackle rising health care costs, we must also work to put Social Security on firmer footing. It's time for both parties to come together and find a way to keep the promise of a sound retirement for future generations. And we should restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code including by shutting down corporate loopholes and ensuring that everyone pays what they owe.

All of these efforts will require tough choices. All these efforts will require compromise. But the difficulties can't serve as an excuse for inaction -- not anymore -- which brings me to one final point I'd like to make today. I've talked a lot about the fundamental weakness in our economy that led us to this day of reckoning. But we also arrived here because of a fundamental weakness in our political system.

For too long, too many in Washington put off hard decisions for some other time on some other day. There's been a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve real problems.

There's also an impatience that characterizes this town -- an attention span that has only grown shorter with the 24-hour news cycle that insists on instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher poll numbers. When a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from shock to trance, with everyone responding to the tempest of the moment until the furor has died down, the media coverage has moved on to something else, instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way.

This can't be one of those times. The challenges are too great. The stakes are too high. I know how difficult it is for members of Congress in both parties to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now. I'd love if these problems were coming at us one at a time instead of five or six at a time. It's more than most Congresses and most Presidents have to deal with in a lifetime.

But we have been called to govern in extraordinary times. And that requires an extraordinary sense of responsibility -- to ourselves, to the men and women who sent us here, to the many generations whose lives will be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here.

There is no doubt that times are still tough. By no means are we out of the woods just yet. But from where we stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to see glimmers of hope. And beyond that, way off in the distance, we can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than our troubled economic past. It's an America teeming with new industry and commerce, humming with new energy and discoveries that light the world once more -- a place where anyone from anywhere with a good idea or the will to work can live the dream they've heard so much about.

That is the house upon the rock -- proud, sturdy, unwavering in the face of the greatest storms. And we will not finish it in one year. We will not finish it in many. But if we use this moment to lay that new foundation, if we come together and begin the hard work of rebuilding, if we persist and persevere against the disappointments and setbacks that will surely lie ahead, then I have no doubt that this house will stand and the dream of our founders will live on in our time.

Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama warned of tough months to come for the economy while noting some ""signs of economic progress,"" from rising home refinances, increases in consumer and small-business lending, and new hiring for economic stimulus projects.

In a broad, 45-minute speech at Georgetown University here, Mr. Obama sounded a note of cautious optimism as he made his most extensive effort to weave together the many strands of his economic policies. He described it as a two-stage process -- to first lift the economy out of recession, then build what he portrayed as a foundation for long-term growth.

Recounting a Biblical parable, the president declared: ""We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand. We must build our house upon a rock. We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest; where we consume less at home and send more exports abroad.""

For weeks now, even some of Mr. Obama's economic supporters have said the president has failed to explain how all of his initiatives -- from bank and auto-industry bailouts to a surge of stimulus spending on health care, energy and education -- fit into a cohesive program. The efforts have often seemed ad hoc and reactive, when in fact they tie together into a long-standing economic agenda, said Robert Reich, a former labor secretary and Obama campaign adviser.

""The public can't tell the difference between a bank bailout and 10-year budget designed to invest in our future productivity,"" Mr. Reich said. ""The narrative is there. It has the virtue of being truthful. It's important to state it.""

The president laid out five ""pillars"" to build a lasting recovery on: new regulations for Wall Street; education spending focused on strengthening the work force; renewable energy investments to create jobs and lessen the nation's dependence on imported oil; health-care cost containment; and long-term deficit reduction based on controlling the growth of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

The speech broke no new policy ground, and some of his pillars seem elusive, especially his vows of fiscal rectitude. Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R, Ohio), noted that even under the most optimistic scenario, Mr. Obama's budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would double the national debt over five years and triple it over 10.

But in making the speech, the president acknowledged his failure to articulate a larger economic vision, saying, ""many Americans are simply wondering how all of our different programs and policies fit together.""

He also offered some rays of hope amid continuing bad economic news. Schools and police departments have canceled planned layoffs because of the $787 billion stimulus plan. Some industries, like infrastructure construction firms, renewable-energy companies and energy-efficient window makers, have begun to hire in anticipation of federally funded projects. New programs to unclog credit markets are beginning to have an impact on auto, small-business and student loans.

""The severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more foreclosures, and more pain before it ends. The market will continue to rise and fall. Credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it should,"" he warned.

He said he wouldn't jettison major elements of his program, such as his national health plan, to satisfy demands for ""instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher poll numbers.""

Outside advisers say the president hasn't done enough so far to put his proposals in one broader framework. He rolled out the push for national health-insurance coverage, a plan to cap carbon emissions and develop renewable-energy resources and an unprecedented expansion of federal education support as separate initiatives, inviting criticism that he isn't sufficiently focusing on the recession.


","AS he spoke about the economy on Tuesday, President Obama invoked the parable in the Sermon on the Mount about two houses, one built on sand only to be blown away in a storm and another built on rock impervious to the swirling winds.

Mr. Obama was trying to explain why he wants not only to revive the sagging economy but to virtually reinvent it with sweeping changes in health care, energy and education. Without deeper reform, he argued, the economy would only topple again later.

But as he confronted critics in a wide-ranging hourlong speech to students and faculty members at Georgetown University, he also sought to shift his expansive economic program off the political sands onto a firmer foundation.

As Mr. Obama acknowledged, many Americans think he is taking on too much at once, or, conversely, not doing enough at all, or just wondering how all the pieces of his agenda fit together. A flurry of government action has yet to reverse the nation's economic calamity, and while Mr. Obama said again that he detects ""glimmers of hope,"" he pleaded for patience from an instant-gratification society that usually responds to crisis with ""a lurch from shock to trance.""

""It's more than most Congresses and most presidents have to deal with in a lifetime,"" Mr. Obama said. ""But we have been called to govern in extraordinary times. And that requires an extraordinary sense of responsibility to ourselves, to the men and women who sent us here, to the many generations whose lives will be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here.""

Mr. Obama chose to give what aides described as a ""major speech"" shortly before leaving Thursday for Trinidad and Mexico, his second foreign trip of the month. It served as a reminder to his domestic audience that he remains focused on the economy and an effort to frame the debate before Congress returns from its spring recess next week.

Skeptics, including some in his own party, have questioned whether it makes sense for Mr. Obama to focus on expanding health care coverage, curbing greenhouse gases and other priorities when jobs continue to disappear at a dizzying rate, the banking sector remains in limbo, the auto industry is hanging over the precipice and the federal budget deficit is soaring.

Mr. Obama used the address to link those disparate issues and present an integrated vision for the future of American capitalism when the recession eventually ends. He defended himself against those who accuse him of bankrupting the nation and those who argue that he should be more aggressive about taking over banks and spending even more money.

""I know there's a criticism out there that my administration has been spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agenda while mortgaging our children's future,"" Mr. Obama said. But he rejected that characterization and said it was time to make difficult decisions. ""There's been a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve real problems.""

He chided critics of his spending plans and recommitted himself to addressing the entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid that consume so much of the budget.

""Let's not kid ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a few earmarks or cutting the budget for the National Endowment for the Arts,"" he said. ""If we want to get serious about fiscal discipline, and I do,"" then the country's leaders must ""get serious about entitlement reform.""

That drew a rebuke from Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, who accused the president of not being serious himself about entitlements or deficits.

""Talk is cheap in Washington,"" Mr. Boehner's office said in a statement, ""so the question to the administration continues to be: what's the plan, and if we should 'get serious' about it, why did you choose to ignore entitlement reform in your budget?""

In defending his commitment to fiscal restraint, Mr. Obama continued to cite a statistic widely scorned by budget specialists. He again claimed that ""we've identified $2 trillion in deficit reductions over the next decade.""

Three-quarters of those ""reductions,"" however, reflect assumptions that the nation would have had as many troops in Iraq in 10 years as it does now, even though President George W. Bush signed an agreement with Baghdad before leaving office that would result in the withdrawal of all American forces within three years.

Even as he skirmished with critics on the right, Mr. Obama pushed back at critics on the left who accuse him of being too timid, and ask, as he described their grievance, "" 'Why aren't you tougher on the banks?' "" He said he had not embraced pre-emptive government takeovers because in the end such a move would cost taxpayers more and undermine confidence. ""Government should practice the same principle as doctors,"" he said. ""First, do no harm.""

In listing his priorities, Mr. Obama again insisted that health care be overhauled by the end of the year, and he embraced the ""courageous set of reforms"" proposed by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to cancel costly weapons programs.

He was less precise about his timing for a market-based cap on carbon emissions, which are blamed for climate change. Democrats in Congress left a cap out of the budget outline passed in separate form by the House and Senate. Critics have said a cap would hurt industry and cost energy consumers during a recession.

Democratic lawmakers are pushing such cap-and-trade legislation, but appear uncertain that it could pass this year. Mr. Obama agreed that ""we have to take into account the costs of transition"" to a new system. But he added: ""We can no longer delay putting a framework for a clean energy economy in place. That needs to be done now.""

Such initiatives, he argued, are every bit as necessary as solving the banking or housing crises. ""If we don't lay this new foundation now,"" he said, ""it won't be long before we're right back where we are today.""

7,7,2009-05-22-NationalSecurity.txt,"Let me just acknowledge the presence of some of my outstanding Cabinet members and advisors.  We've got our Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.  We have our CIA Director Leon Panetta.  We have our Secretary of Defense William Gates; Secretary Napolitano of Department of Homeland Security; Attorney General Eric Holder; my National Security Advisor Jim Jones.  And I want to especially thank our Acting Archivist of the United States, Adrienne Thomas.

I also want to acknowledge several members of the House who have great interest in intelligence matters.  I want to thank Congressman Reyes, Congressman Hoekstra, Congressman King, as well as Congressman Thompson, for being here today.  Thank you so much.

These are extraordinary times for our country.  We're confronting a historic economic crisis.  We're fighting two wars.  We face a range of challenges that will define the way that Americans will live in the 21st century.  So there's no shortage of work to be done, or responsibilities to bear.

And we've begun to make progress.  Just this week, we've taken steps to protect American consumers and homeowners, and to reform our system of government contracting so that we better protect our people while spending our money more wisely.  The -- it's a good bill.  The engines of our economy are slowly beginning to turn, and we're working towards historic reform on health care and on energy.  I want to say to the members of Congress, I welcome all the extraordinary work that has been done over these last four months on these and other issues.

In the midst of all these challenges, however, my single most important responsibility as President is to keep the American people safe.  It's the first thing that I think about when I wake up in the morning.  It's the last thing that I think about when I go to sleep at night.

And this responsibility is only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our people, and technology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do us great harm.  We are less than eight years removed from the deadliest attack on American soil in our history.  We know that al Qaeda is actively planning to attack us again.  We know that this threat will be with us for a long time, and that we must use all elements of our power to defeat it.

Already, we've taken several steps to achieve that goal.  For the first time since 2002, we're providing the necessary resources and strategic direction to take the fight to the extremists who attacked us on 9/11 in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  We're investing in the 21st century military and intelligence capabilities that will allow us to stay one step ahead of a nimble enemy.  We have re-energized a global non-proliferation regime to deny the world's most dangerous people access to the world's deadliest weapons.  And we've launched an effort to secure all loose nuclear materials within four years.  We're better protecting our border, and increasing our preparedness for any future attack or natural disaster.  We're building new partnerships around the world to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates.  And we have renewed American diplomacy so that we once again have the strength and standing to truly lead the world.

These steps are all critical to keeping America secure.  But I believe with every fiber of my being that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values.  The documents that we hold in this very hall -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights -- these are not simply words written into aging parchment.  They are the foundation of liberty and justice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity around the world.

I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents.  My father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered.  My mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when I lived as a child in a foreign land.  My own American journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words -- ""to form a more perfect union.""  I've studied the Constitution as a student, I've taught it as a teacher, I've been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator.  I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution as Commander-in-Chief, and as a citizen, I know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake.

I make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism.  We uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it keeps us safe.  Time and again, our values have been our best national security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of upheaval.

Fidelity to our values is the reason why the United States of America grew from a small string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world.

It's the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatment from America's Armed Forces than from their own government.

It's the reason why America has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn a sharp, moral contrast with our adversaries.

It's the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free peoples everywhere in the common cause and common effort of liberty.

From Europe to the Pacific, we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law.  That is who we are.  And where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, America must demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than a hateful ideology.

After 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era -- that enemies who did not abide by any law of war would present new challenges to our application of the law; that our government would need new tools to protect the American people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply prosecuting those who try to carry them out.

Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions.  I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people.  But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.  Instead of strategically applying our power and our principles, too often we set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford.  And during this season of fear, too many of us -- Democrats and Republicans, politicians, journalists, and citizens -- fell silent.

In other words, we went off course.  And this is not my assessment alone.  It was an assessment that was shared by the American people who nominated candidates for President from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a new approach -- one that rejected torture and one that recognized the imperative of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.

Now let me be clear:  We are indeed at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates.  We do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat.  But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability.  For reasons that I will explain, the decisions that were made over the last eight years established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable -- a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions and time-tested institutions, and that failed to use our values as a compass.  And that's why I took several steps upon taking office to better protect the American people.

First, I banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States of America.

I know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe.  I could not disagree more.  As Commander-in-Chief, I see the intelligence.  I bear the responsibility for keeping this country safe.  And I categorically reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation.  What's more, they undermine the rule of law.  They alienate us in the world.  They serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America.  They risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that Americans will be mistreated if they are captured.  In short, they did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them, and that is why I ended them once and for all.

Now, I should add, the arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration.  As Senator McCain once said, torture ""serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us.""  And even under President Bush, there was recognition among members of his own administration -- including a Secretary of State, other senior officials, and many in the military and intelligence community -- that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, and the wrong side of history.  That's why we must leave these methods where they belong -- in the past.  They are not who we are, and they are not America.

The second decision that I made was to order the closing of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.

For over seven years, we have detained hundreds of people at Guantanamo.  During that time, the system of military commissions that were in place at Guantanamo succeeded in convicting a grand total of three suspected terrorists.  Let me repeat that:  three convictions in over seven years.  Instead of bringing terrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setback after setback, cases lingered on, and in 2006 the Supreme Court invalidated the entire system.  Meanwhile, over 525 detainees were released from Guantanamo under not my administration, under the previous administration.  Let me repeat that:  Two-thirds of the detainees were released before I took office and ordered the closure of Guantanamo.

There is also no question that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America's strongest currency in the world.  Instead of building a durable framework for the struggle against al Qaeda that drew upon our deeply held values and traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the rule of law.  In fact, part of the rationale for establishing Guantanamo in the first place was the misplaced notion that a prison there would be beyond the law -- a proposition that the Supreme Court soundly rejected.  Meanwhile, instead of serving as a tool to counter terrorism, Guantanamo became a symbol that helped al Qaeda recruit terrorists to its cause.  Indeed, the existence of Guantanamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained.

So the record is clear:  Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security.  It is a rallying cry for our enemies.  It sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries.  By any measure, the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it.  That's why I argued that it should be closed throughout my campaign, and that is why I ordered it closed within one year.

The third decision that I made was to order a review of all pending cases at Guantanamo.  I knew when I ordered Guantanamo closed that it would be difficult and complex.  There are 240 people there who have now spent years in legal limbo.  In dealing with this situation, we don't have the luxury of starting from scratch.  We're cleaning up something that is, quite simply, a mess -- a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant, almost daily basis, and it consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our country.

Indeed, the legal challenges that have sparked so much debate in recent weeks here in Washington would be taking place whether or not I decided to close Guantanamo.  For example, the court order to release 17 Uighurs -- 17 Uighur detainees took place last fall, when George Bush was President.  The Supreme Court that invalidated the system of prosecution at Guantanamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed by Republican Presidents -- not wild-eyed liberals.  In other words, the problem of what to do with Guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility; the problem exists because of the decision to open Guantanamo in the first place. 

Now let me be blunt.  There are no neat or easy answers here.  I wish there were.  But I can tell you that the wrong answer is to pretend like this problem will go away if we maintain an unsustainable status quo.  As President, I refuse to allow this problem to fester.  I refuse to pass it on to somebody else.  It is my responsibility to solve the problem.  Our security interests will not permit us to delay.  Our courts won't allow it.  And neither should our conscience.

Now, over the last several weeks, we've seen a return of the politicization of these issues that have characterized the last several years.  I'm an elected official; I understand these problems arouse passions and concerns.  They should.  We're confronting some of the most complicated questions that a democracy can face.  But I have no interest in spending all of our time relitigating the policies of the last eight years.  I'll leave that to others.  I want to solve these problems, and I want to solve them together as Americans.

And we will be ill-served by some of the fear-mongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue.  Listening to the recent debate, I've heard words that, frankly, are calculated to scare people rather than educate them; words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country.  So I want to take this opportunity to lay out what we are doing, and how we intend to resolve these outstanding issues.  I will explain how each action that we are taking will help build a framework that protects both the American people and the values that we hold most dear.  And I'll focus on two broad areas:  first, issues relating to Guantanamo and our detention policy; but, second, I also want to discuss issues relating to security and transparency.

Now, let me begin by disposing of one argument as plainly as I can:  We are not going to release anyone if it would endanger our national security, nor will we release detainees within the United States who endanger the American people.  Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders -- namely, highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety. 

As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following face:  Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal, supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists.  As Republican Lindsey Graham said, the idea that we cannot find a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the United States is not rational.

We are currently in the process of reviewing each of the detainee cases at Guantanamo to determine the appropriate policy for dealing with them.  And as we do so, we are acutely aware that under the last administration, detainees were released and, in some cases, returned to the battlefield.  That's why we are doing away with the poorly planned, haphazard approach that let those detainees go in the past.  Instead we are treating these cases with the care and attention that the law requires and that our security demands.

Now, going forward, these cases will fall into five distinct categories.

First, whenever feasible, we will try those who have violated American criminal laws in federal courts -- courts provided for by the United States Constitution.  Some have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trials of terrorists.  They are wrong.  Our courts and our juries, our citizens, are tough enough to convict terrorists.  The record makes that clear.  Ramzi Yousef tried to blow up the World Trade Center.  He was convicted in our courts and is serving a life sentence in U.S. prisons.  Zacarias Moussaoui has been identified as the 20th 9/11 hijacker.  He was convicted in our courts, and he too is serving a life sentence in prison.  If we can try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons, then we can do the same with detainees from Guantanamo.

Recently, we prosecuted and received a guilty plea from a detainee, al-Marri, in federal court after years of legal confusion.  We're preparing to transfer another detainee to the Southern District Court of New York, where he will face trial on charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- bombings that killed over 200 people.  Preventing this detainee from coming to our shores would prevent his trial and conviction.  And after over a decade, it is time to finally see that justice is served, and that is what we intend to do.

The second category of cases involves detainees who violate the laws of war and are therefore best tried through military commissions.  Military commissions have a history in the United States dating back to George Washington and the Revolutionary War.  They are an appropriate venue for trying detainees for violations of the laws of war.  They allow for the protection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering; they allow for the safety and security of participants; and for the presentation of evidence gathered from the battlefield that cannot always be effectively presented in federal courts.

Now, some have suggested that this represents a reversal on my part.  They should look at the record.  In 2006, I did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the Bush administration and passed by the Congress because it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework, with the kind of meaningful due process rights for the accused that could stand up on appeal.

I said at that time, however, that I supported the use of military commissions to try detainees, provided there were several reforms, and in fact there were some bipartisan efforts to achieve those reforms.  Those are the reforms that we are now making.  Instead of using the flawed commissions of the last seven years, my administration is bringing our commissions in line with the rule of law.  We will no longer permit the use of evidence -- as evidence statements that have been obtained using cruel, inhuman, or degrading interrogation methods.  We will no longer place the burden to prove that hearsay is unreliable on the opponent of the hearsay.  And we will give detainees greater latitude in selecting their own counsel, and more protections if they refuse to testify.  These reforms, among others, will make our military commissions a more credible and effective means of administering justice, and I will work with Congress and members of both parties, as well as legal authorities across the political spectrum, on legislation to ensure that these commissions are fair, legitimate, and effective.

The third category of detainees includes those who have been ordered released by the courts.  Now, let me repeat what I said earlier:  This has nothing to do with my decision to close Guantanamo.  It has to do with the rule of law.  The courts have spoken.  They have found that there's no legitimate reason to hold 21 of the people currently held at Guantanamo.  Nineteen of these findings took place before I was sworn into office.  I cannot ignore these rulings because as President, I too am bound by the law.  The United States is a nation of laws and so we must abide by these rulings.

The fourth category of cases involves detainees who we have determined can be transferred safely to another country.  So far, our review team has approved 50 detainees for transfer.  And my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation.

Now, finally, there remains the question of detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the American people.  And I have to be honest here -- this is the toughest single issue that we will face.  We're going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at Guantanamo who pose a danger to our country.  But even when this process is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States.  Examples of that threat include people who've received extensive explosives training at al Qaeda training camps, or commanded Taliban troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans.  These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States.

Let me repeat:  I am not going to release individuals who endanger the American people.  Al Qaeda terrorists and their affiliates are at war with the United States, and those that we capture -- like other prisoners of war -- must be prevented from attacking us again.  Having said that, we must recognize that these detention policies cannot be unbounded.  They can't be based simply on what I or the executive branch decide alone.  That's why my administration has begun to reshape the standards that apply to ensure that they are in line with the rule of law. We must have clear, defensible, and lawful standards for those who fall into this category.  We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes.  We must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified.

I know that creating such a system poses unique challenges. And other countries have grappled with this question; now, so must we.  But I want to be very clear that our goal is to construct a legitimate legal framework for the remaining Guantanamo detainees that cannot be transferred.  Our goal is not to avoid a legitimate legal framework.  In our constitutional system, prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man.  If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight.  And so, going forward, my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our Constitution.

Now, as our efforts to close Guantanamo move forward, I know that the politics in Congress will be difficult.  These are issues that are fodder for 30-second commercials.  You can almost picture the direct mail pieces that emerge from any vote on this issue -- designed to frighten the population.  I get it.  But if we continue to make decisions within a climate of fear, we will make more mistakes.  And if we refuse to deal with these issues today, then I guarantee you that they will be an albatross around our efforts to combat terrorism in the future. 

I have confidence that the American people are more interested in doing what is right to protect this country than in political posturing.  I am not the only person in this city who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution -- so did each and every member of Congress.  And together we have a responsibility to enlist our values in the effort to secure our people, and to leave behind the legacy that makes it easier for future Presidents to keep this country safe.

Now, let me touch on a second set of issues that relate to security and transparency. 

National security requires a delicate balance.  One the one hand, our democracy depends on transparency.  On the other hand, some information must be protected from public disclosure for the sake of our security -- for instance, the movement of our troops, our intelligence-gathering, or the information we have about a terrorist organization and its affiliates.  In these and other cases, lives are at stake.

Now, several weeks ago, as part of an ongoing court case, I released memos issued by the previous administration's Office of Legal Counsel.  I did not do this because I disagreed with the enhanced interrogation techniques that those memos authorized, and I didn't release the documents because I rejected their legal rationales -- although I do on both counts.  I released the memos because the existence of that approach to interrogation was already widely known, the Bush administration had acknowledged its existence, and I had already banned those methods.  The argument that somehow by releasing those memos we are providing terrorists with information about how they will be interrogated makes no sense.  We will not be interrogating terrorists using that approach.  That approach is now prohibited.

In short, I released these memos because there was no overriding reason to protect them.  And the ensuing debate has helped the American people better understand how these interrogation methods came to be authorized and used.

On the other hand, I recently opposed the release of certain photographs that were taken of detainees by U.S. personnel between 2002 and 2004.  Individuals who violated standards of behavior in these photos have been investigated and they have been held accountable.  There was and is no debate as to whether what is reflected in those photos is wrong.  Nothing has been concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes.  However, it was my judgment -- informed by my national security team -- that releasing these photos would inflame anti-American opinion and allow our enemies to paint U.S. troops with a broad, damning, and inaccurate brush, thereby endangering them in theaters of war.

In short, there is a clear and compelling reason to not release these particular photos.  There are nearly 200,000 Americans who are serving in harm's way, and I have a solemn responsibility for their safety as Commander-in-Chief.  Nothing would be gained by the release of these photos that matters more than the lives of our young men and women serving in harm's way.

Now, in the press's mind and in some of the public's mind, these two cases are contradictory.  They are not to me.  In each of these cases, I had to strike the right balance between transparency and national security.  And this balance brings with it a precious responsibility.  There's no doubt that the American people have seen this balance tested over the last several years.  In the images from Abu Ghraib and the brutal interrogation techniques made public long before I was President, the American people learned of actions taken in their name that bear no resemblance to the ideals that generations of Americans have fought for.  And whether it was the run-up to the Iraq war or the revelation of secret programs, Americans often felt like part of the story had been unnecessarily withheld from them.  And that caused suspicion to build up.  And that leads to a thirst for accountability.

I understand that.  I ran for President promising transparency, and I meant what I said.  And that's why, whenever possible, my administration will make all information available to the American people so that they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable.  But I have never argued -- and I never will -- that our most sensitive national security matters should simply be an open book.  I will never abandon -- and will vigorously defend -- the necessity of classification to defend our troops at war, to protect sources and methods, and to safeguard confidential actions that keep the American people safe.  Here's the difference though:  Whenever we cannot release certain information to the public for valid national security reasons, I will insist that there is oversight of my actions -- by Congress or by the courts.

We're currently launching a review of current policies by all those agencies responsible for the classification of documents to determine where reforms are possible, and to assure that the other branches of government will be in a position to review executive branch decisions on these matters.  Because in our system of checks and balances, someone must always watch over the watchers -- especially when it comes to sensitive administration -- information.

Now, along these same lines, my administration is also confronting challenges to what is known as the ""state secrets"" privilege.  This is a doctrine that allows the government to challenge legal cases involving secret programs.  It's been used by many past Presidents -- Republican and Democrat -- for many decades.  And while this principle is absolutely necessary in some circumstances to protect national security, I am concerned that it has been over-used.  It is also currently the subject of a wide range of lawsuits.  So let me lay out some principles here.  We must not protect information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government.  And that's why my administration is nearing completion of a thorough review of this practice.

And we plan to embrace several principles for reform.  We will apply a stricter legal test to material that can be protected under the state secrets privilege.  We will not assert the privilege in court without first following our own formal process, including review by a Justice Department committee and the personal approval of the Attorney General.  And each year we will voluntarily report to Congress when we have invoked the privilege and why because, as I said before, there must be proper oversight over our actions.

On all these matters related to the disclosure of sensitive information, I wish I could say that there was some simple formula out there to be had.  There is not.  These often involve tough calls, involve competing concerns, and they require a surgical approach.  But the common thread that runs through all of my decisions is simple:  We will safeguard what we must to protect the American people, but we will also ensure the accountability and oversight that is the hallmark of our constitutional system.  I will never hide the truth because it's uncomfortable.  I will deal with Congress and the courts as co-equal branches of government.  I will tell the American people what I know and don't know, and when I release something publicly or keep something secret, I will tell you why.

Now, in all the areas that I've discussed today, the policies that I've proposed represent a new direction from the last eight years.  To protect the American people and our values, we've banned enhanced interrogation techniques.  We are closing the prison at Guantanamo.  We are reforming military commissions, and we will pursue a new legal regime to detain terrorists.  We are declassifying more information and embracing more oversight of our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state secrets privilege.  These are dramatic changes that will put our approach to national security on a surer, safer, and more sustainable footing.  Their implementation will take time, but they will get done.

There's a core principle that we will apply to all of our actions.  Even as we clean up the mess at Guantanamo, we will constantly reevaluate our approach, subject our decisions to review from other branches of government, as well as the public.  We seek the strongest and most sustainable legal framework for addressing these issues in the long term -- not to serve immediate politics, but to do what's right over the long term.  By doing that we can leave behind a legacy that outlasts my administration, my presidency, that endures for the next President and the President after that -- a legacy that protects the American people and enjoys a broad legitimacy at home and abroad.

Now, this is what I mean when I say that we need to focus on the future.  I recognize that many still have a strong desire to focus on the past.  When it comes to actions of the last eight years, passions are high.  Some Americans are angry; others want to re-fight debates that have been settled, in some cases debates that they have lost.  I know that these debates lead directly, in some cases, to a call for a fuller accounting, perhaps through an independent commission.

I've opposed the creation of such a commission because I believe that our existing democratic institutions are strong enough to deliver accountability.  The Congress can review abuses of our values, and there are ongoing inquiries by the Congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques.  The Department of Justice and our courts can work through and punish any violations of our laws or miscarriages of justice.

It's no secret there is a tendency in Washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another.  And it's no secret that our media culture feeds the impulse that lead to a good fight and good copy.  But nothing will contribute more than that than a extended relitigation of the last eight years.  Already, we've seen how that kind of effort only leads those in Washington to different sides to laying blame.  It can distract us from focusing our time, our efforts, and our politics on the challenges of the future.

We see that, above all, in the recent debate -- how the recent debate has obscured the truth and sends people into opposite and absolutist ends.  On the one side of the spectrum, there are those who make little allowance for the unique challenges posed by terrorism, and would almost never put national security over transparency.  And on the other end of the spectrum, there are those who embrace a view that can be summarized in two words:  ""Anything goes.""  Their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting terrorism can be used to justify any means, and that the President should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants -- provided it is a President with whom they agree.

Both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right.  The American people are not absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems.  They know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense.  That, after all, is the unique genius of America.  That's the challenge laid down by our Constitution.  That has been the source of our strength through the ages.  That's what makes the United States of America different as a nation.

I can stand here today, as President of the United States, and say without exception or equivocation that we do not torture, and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law.  Make no mistake:  If we fail to turn the page on the approach that was taken over the past several years, then I will not be able to say that as President.  And if we cannot stand for our core values, then we are not keeping faith with the documents that are enshrined in this hall.

The Framers who drafted the Constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded over the last 222 years.  But our Constitution has endured through secession and civil rights, through World War and Cold War, because it provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically; it provides a compass that can help us find our way.  It hasn't always been easy.  We are an imperfect people.  Every now and then, there are those who think that America's safety and success requires us to walk away from the sacred principles enshrined in this building.  And we hear such voices today.  But over the long haul the American people have resisted that temptation.  And though we've made our share of mistakes, required some course corrections, ultimately we have held fast to the principles that have been the source of our strength and a beacon to the world.

Now this generation faces a great test in the specter of terrorism.  And unlike the Civil War or World War II, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.  Right now, in distant training camps and in crowded cities, there are people plotting to take American lives.  That will be the case a year from now, five years from now, and -- in all probability -- 10 years from now.  Neither I nor anyone can stand here today and say that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes American lives.  But I can say with certainty that my administration -- along with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and women who defend our national security -- will do everything in our power to keep the American people safe.  And I do know with certainty that we can defeat al Qaeda.  Because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their ranks and alienate America from our allies, and they will never be able to do that if we stay true to who we are, if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless ideals.  This must be our common purpose.

I ran for President because I believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together.  We will not be safe if we see national security as a wedge that divides America -- it can and must be a cause that unites us as one people and as one nation.  We've done so before in times that were more perilous than ours.  We will do so once again.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama and former Vice President Dick Cheney squared off in contentious, back-to-back addresses over the Bush era's terrorism policies, starkly dramatizing the wide divide on how best to safeguard America while protecting its rights and traditions.

Mr. Obama declared that the nation had gone ""off course"" under former President George W. Bush by endorsing aggressive interrogation tactics and offshore prisons, minutes before Mr. Cheney defended them as ""legal, essential, justified, successful and the right thing to do"" in a speech across town.

The contentious tit for tat riveted Washington, escalating the growing national debate over the president's plans to rewrite the Bush administration's terrorism policies, including closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Those plans have drawn fire from Republicans, stoked doubts among Democrats and put Mr. Obama on the defensive in the biggest political challenge of his young administration. Leading the charge has been Mr. Cheney, who has been unusually aggressive in attacking those policies and trying to rally Republican opposition even as polls show him remaining unpopular with the public.

Mr. Obama, speaking forcefully from the rotunda of the National Archives before the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence, sought to regain the high ground in the debate, arguing that his changes were needed to restore ""the power of our most fundamental values."" He conceded that some key Bush-era policies would remain, from extralegal military commissions to indefinite detentions. But he said he had hoped that by banning interrogation techniques that others have called torture, and by vowing to close Guantanamo Bay in his first week as president, he would move beyond the divisive debates of the past few years, and pivot to his ambitious domestic agenda.

""We went off course,"" the president said. ""And this is not my assessment alone. It was an assessment that was shared by the American people who nominated candidates for president from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a new approach -- one that rejected torture and one that recognized the imperative of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.""

Speaking at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Mr. Cheney responded: ""After the most lethal and devastating terrorist attack ever, seven and a half years without a repeat is not a record to be rebuked or scorned, much less criminalized. It is a record to be continued until the danger has passed.""

Mr. Obama has struggled in recent days to find a way to reframe the debate. Republicans and some Democrats have balked on his plans to close Guantanamo without a clear plan for the prisoners being held there. On Wednesday, the Senate voted 90-6 to strip funding for the closure of Guantanamo from a war spending bill, following a similar vote in the House, underscoring how bipartisan the concerns have become.

Mr. Obama scheduled his speech late last week, after Mr. Cheney's speech already had been publicly scheduled. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the timing ""wasn't based on the fact that anybody else was speaking."" Mr. Cheney delayed the scheduled beginning of his remarks by half an hour to wait for Mr. Obama to finish.

Late Thursday, it wasn't clear whether Mr. Obama had allayed doubts. ""We're all awaiting the details of the plan and the president is going to come up with one,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said after the speech, suggesting that Democrats still needed information before they draw ranks around the Obama policies.

With concerns rising in his own party, the president put out details on his terrorism policies. For the first time, he publicly acknowledged nearly 100 detainees would have to be held indefinitely even though the U.S. would be unable to charge them with war crimes.

Calling it the ""toughest single issue we will face,"" Mr. Obama said many detainees -- some because evidence in their case may have been tainted by civilian legal standards -- would have to be held because they continued to threaten U.S. security.

""These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States,"" he said.

Mr. Obama has promised a more detailed plan for closing Guantanamo in July. While he said that, under his plan, some prisoners would inevitably land in the U.S., he said they would be in ""highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety.""

In his 35-minute address, Mr. Cheney contended the Bush administration methods saved thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of lives, by eliciting crucial information that helped disrupt terrorist attacks.

Mr. Cheney saved some of his toughest criticism for the Obama administration's decision to release memos detailing the interrogation program, including the legal rationale applied by the Bush administration and the specifics about tactics that were applied to individual terrorist suspects. He said the release ""was flatly contrary to the national security interest of the United States,"" adding that it gave terrorists ""a lengthy insert for their training manual.""

Mr. Obama said releasing the memos in no way helped aspiring terrorists train against U.S. tactics, since the interrogation techniques were now banned by the White House.

Thursday's speech included Mr. Obama's most detailed explanation to date of his plans for the 240 detainees. He said the administration will try to bring some of the accused enemy fighters before civilian courts ""wherever feasible,"" while an additional 50 have been deemed safe to transfer to another country.

That leaves the rest to either be tried by military tribunals or held indefinitely in U.S. prisons. Pentagon officials have said about 80 are expected to be charged with war crimes and nearly 100 will remain in legal limbo.

Mr. Obama said he would work with Congress to come up with legal standards for those detainees. He said he was committed there would be judicial and congressional oversight of their detention.

The Obama administration has recently won federal court backing for the notion that laws of war give the government the right to indefinitely detain members of al Qaeda and affiliated groups.

The legal framework needed for such a policy has been debated within the administration. On Wednesday at the White House, the president discussed outlines of a plan with civil-liberties and human-rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union.

These groups led the legal assault that won important court-ordered curbs on the legal underpinnings of the Bush administration's national-security policy. They promised to do the same to Mr. Obama's.
","As President Obama defends his national security strategy, he faces a daunting challenge. He must convince the country that it is in safe hands despite warnings to the contrary from the right, and at the same time persuade the skeptical left that it is enough to amend his predecessor's approach rather than abandon it.

Arguably on the defensive over policy for the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama is gambling that his oratorical powers can reassure the public that bringing terrorism suspects to prisons on American soil will not put the public in danger.

At the same time, he must explain and win support for a nuanced set of positions that fall somewhere between George W. Bush and the American Civil Liberties Union.

Rather than an easily labeled program, Mr. Obama is picking seemingly disparate elements from across the policy continuum -- banning torture and other harsh interrogation techniques but embracing the endless detention of certain terror suspects without trial, closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but retaining the military commissions held there.

""A surgical approach,"" the president called it in his address on Thursday at the National Archives.

But surgical approaches are rarely satisfying to those on either end of the political spectrum who tend to dominate political dialogue in Washington, particularly when it comes to an issue as fraught with emotional resonance and moral implications as the struggle against terrorists.

In the reductionist debate in Washington, either any sacrifice must be made to win a pitiless war against radicals, or terrorism does not justify any compromise with cherished American values.

""Both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right,"" Mr. Obama said. ""The American people are not absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems. They know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense.""

In his rebuttal speech across town, former Vice President Dick Cheney in effect argued that absolutism in the defense of liberty was no vice.

""In the fight against terrorism there is no middle ground, and half measures keep you half-exposed,"" Mr. Cheney said shortly after Mr. Obama's address. ""You cannot keep just some nuclear-armed terrorists out of the United States. Triangulation is a political strategy, not a national security strategy.""

The debates over Mr. Obama's latest decisions -- to establish a legal basis for holding detainees indefinitely without charge and to withhold photographs of past abuse while reauthorizing military tribunals with greater due process -- have become a proxy for a broader struggle that could shape his presidency. With the economy in dire shape, Mr. Obama would prefer to focus on domestic issues and put the polarizing security-versus-liberty argument of the Bush years behind the country, but it stubbornly persists.

With Mr. Cheney accusing the president of endangering the country and liberal allies expressing outrage at what they perceive as his betrayal of progressive principles, the White House concluded that it had no choice but to address the matter head-on.

Mr. Obama has never lacked confidence in his ability to educate and win over people when it comes to complex and combustible issues, as he tried to do on the issue of race in the campaign last year or on abortion in his commencement address on Sunday at the University of Notre Dame.

""The issue skewed off into a lot of different directions in the last couple of weeks,"" David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, said in an interview.

Mr. Axelrod expressed confidence that the public would grasp the new multilayered approach articulated in the speech. ""It was a thoughtful speech that treated the American people like adults,"" he said.

Yet even as the White House argued that Mr. Obama always recognized the complexity of the issues before him, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday acknowledged some surprise at the difficulties involved. Speaking with reporters at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo, he described going through portfolios on ""every single detainee"" at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.

""We knew we were inheriting a system that was not functioning,"" Mr. Biden said. ""We knew we were inheriting a system that was causing us great difficulty around the world."" But he suggested that the administration's approach had been shaped by what it learned after taking office.

""It's like opening Pandora's box here,"" Mr. Biden said. ""We don't know what's inside the box. Now we know a lot more than we did in January.""

Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Cheney used the term ""ad hoc"" to scorn the other party's policy toward terrorism. But the case-by-case approach of the current White House -- officials there describe it as pragmatic -- has generated confusion and disappointment across the political spectrum. While Mr. Obama dismissed concerns among fellow Democrats about ""30-second commercials"" attacking them as weak on terrorism -- ""I get it,"" he said -- the reality is that the debate could replay in harsh fashion in the midterm elections next year.

James Jay Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation, said Mr. Obama risked being left with no supporters on either side for his program.

""The people on the left know there's more in common than not between the Obama policy and the Bush policy,"" he said. ""And the people on the right know there's a credibility problem because there's a gap between what he tells the left and what he's doing.""

Sarah Mendelson, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who led a commission study that urged the closing of Guantanamo, said the fusion of Bush and anti-Bush policies was untenable. ""They're literally trying to combine these paradigms,"" Ms. Mendelson said. ""And that means nobody will be happy.""

8,8,2009-06-15-IranProtests.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody. Today I want to start by addressing three issues, and then I'll take your questions. 
    
First, I'd like to say a few words about the situation in Iran. The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings, and imprisonments of the last few days. I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost.

I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and is not interfering with Iran's affairs. But we must also bear witness to the courage and the dignity of the Iranian people, and to a remarkable opening within Iranian society. And we deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place.

The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future. Some in Iran -- Some in the Iranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the United States and others in the West of instigating protests over the election. These accusations are patently false. They're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking place within Iran's borders. This tired strategy of using old tensions to scapegoat other countries won't work anymore in Iran. This is not about the United States or the West; this is about the people of Iran, and the future that they -- and only they -- will choose. The Iranian people can speak for themselves. That's precisely what's happened in the last few days.

In 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to peaceful protests of justice. Despite the Iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolate itself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phones and computers, and so we've watched what the Iranian people are doing.

This is what we've witnessed.

We've seen the timeless dignity of tens of thousands of Iranians marching in silence. We've seen people of all ages risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that their voices are heard. Above all, we've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality and threats, and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets. While this loss is raw and extraordinarily painful, we also know this: Those who stand up for justice are always on the right side of history.

As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranian people have a universal right to assembly and free speech. If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect those rights and heed the will of its own people. It must govern through consent and not coercion. That's what Iran's own people are calling for, and the Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government.
","Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Sunday defended his weekend election victory while security forces cracked down on opposition leaders and demonstrators, who staged a second day of violent protests across the capital and in other Iranian cities.

The standoffs represent the biggest domestic unrest since authorities put down student riots at Tehran University a decade ago.

In some parts of town, black smoke, ash and shattered glass covered the main roads and sidewalks. Along several roads in both uptown and downtown Tehran, many banks -- all government-owned -- had been attacked the previous night, and their glass windows and doors smashed. Public property such as bus stops and street signs were vandalized. At Mohseni Square in north Tehran, three buildings were burned completely.

Mr. Ahmadinejad's defeated challenger, Mir Hossein Mousavi, said in a statement he was under house arrest and banned from appearing in public. Neither statement has been confirmed by the government. In a post on his Web site, Mr. Mousavi called for a peaceful demonstration on Monday afternoon and asked the police to issue him a permit.

The Obama administration and its European allies openly questioned the results of Iran's presidential vote but also reaffirmed their commitment to pursue direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, irrespective of the electoral outcome.

Vice President Joe Biden said early Sunday he had doubts about whether the election was free and fair. But speaking on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" he said the U.S. and other countries need more time to analyze the vote and said the U.S. must accept ""for the time being"" Tehran's claim that Mr. Ahmadinejad won the contest.

The election result was ""a matter for the Iranian authorities to address,"" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Saturday. ""Our priority is that Iran engages with the concerns of the world community, above all on the issue of nuclear proliferation.""

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier condemned the Iranian government crackdown on opposition protesters as ""unacceptable.""

Across the Arab world and in Israel, reaction was mixed. The results dealt a blow to some Arab officials, who have grown increasingly alarmed by Iran's regional ambitions and hoped Mr. Ahmadinejad's ouster might rein in Tehran.

But others in the region said it could also speed up a key goal: international consensus for tough action against Iran's nuclear program.

""You're not going to waste months and months trying to understand where the new guy is coming from,"" said one Arab official.

Israeli analysts said that the messy vote validates Israel's perceived threat from Iran and increases Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leverage with Washington. Mr. Netanyahu argues that Iran, not Israel-Arab peace talks, should be the focus of American Mideast policy.

Mr. Mousavi was considered by Western leaders as easier to negotiate with. He had a more pragmatic, moderate approach than Mr. Ahmadinejad and had said he would open Iran to foreign investments, reform the economy and pursue peaceful relations with the West and the U.S. Mr. Ahmadinejad hails from the ultraconservative camp, favoring populist economic policies and taking a more defiant stance abroad.

Even if security forces are able to contain protests in coming days, the chaotic election fallout still poses a significant challenge for the clerical establishment that rules the Islamic Republic.

Mr. Mousavi's allegations of widespread vote rigging are raising legitimacy questions at home and abroad, and threaten to haunt Mr. Ahmadinejad's next four years in office.

At his news conference Sunday, Mr. Ahmadinejad called his re-election ""real and free.""

Rajanews, a Web site affiliated with Mr. Ahmadinejad's campaign, carried a number of congratulatory articles and called the election ""the victory of honesty over deception.""

Iran's Interior Ministry, in a televised news conference late Saturday afternoon, said Mr. Ahmadinejad had won about 63% of the votes cast, to Mr. Mousavi's 34%, according to ministry figures. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorsed the results.

With few other details released about the results and no independent monitors at polling stations, it's difficult to gauge the allegations of fraud.

Preliminary results started rolling in just hours after polls closed, raising immediate skepticism because results don't legally have to be announced for 12 hours.

Mr. Mousavi said nearly five million voters were told stations had run out of ballots and couldn't vote. He also said thousands of his election-day monitors weren't given credentials by the Interior Ministry and were banned from entering polling stations.

Late Sunday, Mr. Mousavi released a copy of a letter he wrote to the Guardian Council -- an appointed body of clerics who supervise the government -- asking them to nullify the election results. Mohsen Rezaie, a conservative candidate, wrote a letter to the Interior Ministry demanding it release the breakdown of votes in each polling station across the country.

As of Sunday, the Guardian Council had yet to reply and it wasn't clear whether the Interior Ministry would comply with Mr. Rezaie's request.

Mr. Mousavi's supporters say they plan to fight until Mr. Ahmadinejad's government is toppled and new elections are called. The new administration is set to take office Aug. 11.

Mehdi Karroubi, another candidate and cleric reformist, took off his cleric's robe in protest of the results, according to one of his advisers. Removing one's robe was considered a highly political move by clerics during the revolution. In a statement, Mr. Karroubi told the public to keep protesting peacefully.

At Tehran University Sunday afternoon, following a celebratory rally and news conference by Mr. Ahmadinejad, protesters pelted riot police with stones.

Students were barricaded inside the campus screaming ""death to the dictator,"" as special-forces units on motorcycles threw tear-gas canisters over the fence, and students threw big rocks back at the police. Gunshots were fired into the air.

Students dragged pieces of wood, desks and piles of paper from buildings and set them on fire. Students and protesters outside the campus clashed with antiriot police and paramilitary Basiji forces, trained volunteers in plainclothes who are unleashed during civil protests.

One 29-year-old, interviewed at the scene, rushed from his office nearby to look for his younger sister, a student at Tehran University. As he approached the fence, he said, a Basiji held a canister of pepper spray to his face and sprayed him directly in the eye.

""They have no shame, they have no dignity. How dare they do this to the people?"" the man yelled.

""My shoulders are numb, they hit me with the electric baton,"" said another young man. As students exchanged stories, a group of policemen holding batons ran down the sidewalk toward them.

""They're coming, they're coming,"" some of the students shouted and ran up the road. A few stood there defiantly until the police caught up to them. They threw one man to the ground and began beating him as he screamed.

Less than a block away from the clashes at Tehran University, Mr. Ahmadinejad held a victory rally and spoke to supporters, who waved Iranian flags.

""We love him because he supports justice and Islam,"" said Zahra, a 23-year-old woman who had come from downtown Tehran with her husband to cheer the president. She called the protesters ""sore losers"" and said it was justified for the government to crack down on them.

At his news conference, Mr. Ahmadinejad defended the security services' response, comparing it to police fining rowdy soccer fans for rioting after a match.

""Someone is mad [about the results of the game] and crosses a red line,"" he said, adding: ""I am not happy when people cross a red line and get fined. If only they hadn't crossed it.""

Iranian security forces, deployed heavily across the city, have so far appeared to be capable of containing the flare-ups, often using a heavy hand. By late Sunday, there were no reports of fatalities, but sporadic phone and Internet service made passing information difficult.

Mobile-phone service was suspended by authorities on Saturday and Sunday night. SMS texting, a cheap and reliable way of communicating across Iran, was also out.

Meanwhile, the government appeared to intensify a broad crackdown on opposition leaders. Security forces on Saturday arrested up to 100 prominent reformists in a late-night raid on the headquarters of the country's main reformist political party.

The members had called an emergency meeting late at night. Authorities told the detainees they were being arrested for provoking and orchestrating civil disobedience and unrest in the country.

Mohammad Reza Khatami, brother of former President Mohammad Khatami, was also arrested near his house, according to a person familiar with the situation. He was questioned and released a few hours later.

Iranian universities -- in the middle of final exams -- suspended classes for a week as of Saturday, students said, while many shops remained closed.

It was Mother's Day in Iran Sunday, but the flower shops that were open said their sales were far less than what they normally sold. One florist in central Tehran, at a cross section where both sides clashed, said he had sheltered more protesters than catered to customers. He had had only six orders of bouquets and planned to close shop early.
","The streets of Iranâs capital erupted in the most intense protests in a decade on Saturday, with riot police officers using batons and tear gas against opposition demonstrators who claimed that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had stolen the presidential election.

Witnesses reported that at least one person had been shot dead in clashes with the police in Vanak Square in Tehran. Smoke from burning vehicles and tires hung over the city late Saturday.

The Interior Ministry said Saturday afternoon that Mr. Ahmadinejad had won 62.6 percent of the vote, with Mir Hussein Moussavi, the top challenger, taking just under 34 percent. Turnout was a record 85 percent.

Mr. Moussavi, a former prime minister who had promised to reverse Mr. Ahmadinejadâs hard-line policies, declared himself the winner by a wide margin Friday night, charged widespread election irregularities and called on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iranâs supreme leader, to intervene.

The landslide victory for Mr. Ahmadinejad, an intensely divisive figure here and abroad, came as a powerful shock to opposition supporters, who had cited polls showing that Mr. Moussavi had a strong lead in the final days of the campaign.

Interior Minister Sadegh Mahsouli said Saturday that such a lead was a misimpression based on Mr. Moussaviâs higher levels of support in the capital, and that he had less backing elsewhere.

Mr. Moussavi made clear in statements on Saturday that he rejected the results and called on supporters and fellow clerics to fight them. But there were no reports of any public appearances by him through the day, leading to rumors that he might have been arrested.

In a statement posted on his campaign Web site, Mr. Moussavi said: âToday the peopleâs will has been faced with an amazing incident of lies, hypocrisy and fraud. I call on my Iranian compatriots to remain calm and patient.â

But Ayatollah Khamenei closed the door to any appeals for intervention in a statement issued on state television on Saturday afternoon, congratulating Mr. Ahmadinejad on his victory and pointedly urging the other candidates to support him.

In a televised address to the nation Saturday night, Mr. Ahmadinejad called on the public to respect the results, and he denounced foreign diplomatic and journalistic criticism.

âAll political and propaganda machines abroad and sections inside the country have been mobilized against the nation,â he said.

Mr. Moussaviâs defiance seemed to fuel street resistance by his supporters a coalition including women, young people, intellectuals and members of the moderate clerical establishment who had united in opposition to Mr. Ahmadinejadâs erratic economic stewardship, confrontational foreign policy and crackdown on social freedoms.

âDeath to the coup dâÃ©tat!â chanted a surging crowd of several thousand protesters, many of whom wore Mr. Moussaviâs signature bright green campaign colors, as they marched in central Tehran on Saturday afternoon. âDeath to the dictator!â

Farther down the street, clusters of young men hurled rocks at a phalanx of riot police officers, and the police used their batons to beat back protesters. There were reports of demonstrations in other major Iranian cities as well.

The authorities closed universities in Tehran, blocked cellphone transmissions and access to Facebook and some other Web sites, and for a second day shut down text-messaging services.

As night settled in, the streets in northern Tehran that recently had been the scene of pre-election euphoria were lit by the flames of trash fires and blocked by tipped trash bins and at least one charred bus. Young men ran through the streets throwing paving stones at shop windows, and the police pursued them.

Earlier in the day, hurried meetings were reported among Iranâs leading political figures and clerics; some were said to be trying to influence Ayatollah Khamenei to intervene in a situation that could stain public confidence in the integrity of Iranâs elections.

But Saeed Leylaz, an economist and political analyst, said he believed that Ayatollah Khameneiâs statement would bring a resolution, even if demonstrations persisted for a few days. âThis has put an end to political negotiations from above,â Mr. Leylaz said.

For the moment, Ayatollah Khameneiâs admonition did nothing to calm the oppositionâs rage.

âThe results of the 10th presidential election are so ridiculous and so unbelievable that one cannot write or talk about it in a statement,â said Mehdi Karroubi, a reformist cleric and candidate.

Mr. Karroubi came in last with 300,000 votes far fewer than analysts had predicted. âIt is amazing that the peopleâs vote has turned into an instrument for the government to stabilize itself,â he said.

The other candidate, Mohsen Rezai, got 680,000 votes, Interior Ministry officials said.

In 2005, when Mr. Karroubi was also a candidate for president, he accused the government of rigging the vote in Mr. Ahmadinejadâs favor. In that election, the government announced when polls closed that there would probably be a runoff between two of three candidates, a reform candidate and a former police chief.

But by 7 a.m. the next day, a spokesman for the Guardian Council, a clerical oversight panel that is not supposed to be involved in vote counting, announced that Mr. Ahmadinejad was in first place. Mr. Karroubiâs charges were never investigated.

The turmoil on Saturday followed an extraordinary night in which the Iranian state news agency announced that Mr. Ahmadinejad had won by a vast margin just two hours after the polls closed. The timing alone provoked deep suspicion here, because the authorities have never before announced election results until the following morning. Mr. Moussavi also announced Friday night that he believed he had won by a wide margin.

Mr. Moussavi also complained about irregularities and unfairness in the election, saying there had been a lack of ballots in many areas and that some of his campaign offices had been attacked and his Web sites shut down.

The official results prompted further skepticism, in part because Mr. Ahmadinejad was said to have won by large margins even in his opponentsâ hometowns. Mr. Rezaiâs hometown, for example, gave him less than a tenth of Mr. Ahmadinejadâs total there, the Interior Ministry said.

The issue of vote-rigging has often been raised in Iranian elections, but analysts have generally said the authorities can manipulate the results by only a few percentage points, leaving room for genuine democratic movements.

Iranâs clerical leaders often point to past reformist victories as proof of the Islamic Republicâs democratic legitimacy. Many reformists have boycotted votes in the past to avoid giving the clerics that satisfaction. Those reformists voted in large numbers this time, inspired by a vast popular movement that rose up to support Mr. Moussavi.

Their bitterness on Saturday at the unexpected results was correspondingly severe.

âWe are not disposable things to be thrown away,â said Mahshid, 20, a student who declined to give her last name because she feared repercussions from the authorities. âFrom now on, we wonât vote. They have insulted our feelings of patriotism.â

Meanwhile, the working-class areas of southern Tehran where Mr. Ahmadinejad is popular were largely quiet, despite rumors of wild victory celebrations.

âThere might be some manipulation in what the government has done,â said Maliheh Afrouz, 55, a supporter of Mr. Ahmadinejad clad in a black chador. âBut the other side is exaggerating, making it seem worse than it really is.â

Hello, Michigan! Thank you.  Thank you so much.  First of all, give Joe a big round of applause for the wonderful introduction. We've got some special guests here -- now, if everybody has chairs, go ahead and use them. Feel free.  We've got some special guests here today that I just want to acknowledge.  All of you are special, but these folks I want to make sure that you have a chance to see them.

First of all, one of the best governors in the country, please give Jennifer Granholm a big round of applause. Lieutenant Governor John Cherry -- give John a big round of applause.  One of my favorite people, a former colleague of mine, still just a fighter on behalf of working families each and every day -- Senator Debbie Stabenow.  We've got Speaker of the House, Andy Dillon, in the house.  We've got a lot of other local elected officials, and I just want to thank them.

A couple of people who are missing:  Carl Levin, who is doing great work.  He's in the Senate right now fighting on behalf of a bill to make sure that we're not loading up a bunch of necessary defense spending with unnecessary defense spending.  So he's the point person on it.  The only reason he's not here is because he is working alongside the administration to get this bill done.  Please give him a big round of applause.  Congressman Sandy Levin, also working hard on your behalf each and every day, but is not here today.  I want to go ahead and acknowledge the new mayor, since he's the new mayor -- Mayor Dave Bing, great ball player. My game is a little like Dave Bing's -- except I don't have the jump shot or the speed or the ball handling skills -- or the endurance.  Also don't have the afro.  Don't think I forgot that, Dave.  I remember. I remember that.

I also want to acknowledge that we've got the Executive Director of the White House Council on Auto Communities and Workers, who's working hard, has a direct line to me each and every day.  He's traveling constantly back here -- Ed Montgomery.  Please give Ed a big round of applause.

And the Chairman of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indian Tribe, Derek Bailey is here.  Please give Derek a big round of applause.

And finally, the president of the college where we are here, Jim Jacobs.  Give Jim Jacobs a big round of applause.

And those of you who I've missed, you know how grateful I am that you're here.  And thank you all.  It is wonderful to be back at Macomb.  It was terrific visiting this campus as a candidate, but I have to admit, it's even better visiting as a President.

Now, this is a place where anyone -- anyone with a desire to learn and to grow, to take their career to a new level or start a new career altogether -- has the opportunity to pursue their dream, right here in Macomb.  This is a place where people of all ages and all backgrounds -- even in the face of obstacles, even in the face of very difficult personal challenges -- can take a chance on a brighter future for themselves and their families.

There are folks like Joe, who just told us his story.  When Joe lost his job, he decided to take advantage of assistance for displaced workers.  He earned his associate degree here at Macomb, and with a pretty impressive GPA, I might add.  And with the help of that degree, Joe found a new job, working for the new Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital as a maintenance mechanic, using the skills he learned here and the talents that he brought to make a fresh start.

There are workers like Kellie Kulman, who is here today. Where's Kellie?  Raise your hand, Kellie.  Where are you?  There you are.  There's Kellie right there.  Kellie is a UAW worker at a Ford plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan.  She used to drive a fork lift, right?  But then she decided to train here at Macomb for a job that required new skills, and now she's an apprentice pipe fitter.  It's a telling example:  Even as this painful restructuring takes place in our auto industry, workers are seeking out training for new auto jobs.  And Joe and Kellie's story make clear what all of you know:  Community colleges are an essential part of our recovery in the present -- and our prosperity in the future.  This place can make the future better, not just for these individuals but for America.

Now, since this recession began 20 months ago, 6.5 million Americans have lost their jobs, and I don't have to tell you Michigan in particular has been hard-hit.  Now, I -- the statistics are daunting.  The whole country now, the unemployment rate is approaching 10 percent.  Here in Michigan, it's about five points higher.  And new jobs of course are going to be coming out and we're going to see continuing job loss even as the economy is beginning to stabilize.

Now, that's not just abstractions.  Those just aren't numbers on a page.  Those are extraordinary hardships, tough times, for families and individuals who've worked hard all their lives and have done the right things all their lives.  If you haven't lost a job, chances are you know somebody who has:  a family member, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker.  And you know that as difficult as the financial struggle can be, the sense of loss is about more than just a paycheck, because most of us define ourselves by the work we do.  That's part of what it means to be an American.  We take pride in work -- that sense that you're contributing, supporting your family, meeting your responsibilities.  People need work not just for income, but because it makes you part of that fabric of a community that's so important.  And so when you lose your job, and when entire communities are losing thousands of jobs, that's a heavy burden, that's a heavy weight.

Now, my administration has a job to do, as well, and that job is to get this economy back on its feet.  That's my job. And it's a job I gladly accept.  I love these folks who helped get us in this mess and then suddenly say, well, this is Obama's economy.  That's fine.  Give it to me.  My job is to solve problems, not to stand on the sidelines and harp and gripe.

So I welcome the job.  I want the responsibility.  And I know that -- let's just take an example.  Many questioned our efforts to help save GM and Chrysler from collapse earlier this year.  Their feeling was these companies were driven to the brink by poor management decisions over a long period of time, and like any business they should be held accountable for those decisions.  I agree that they should be held accountable.  But I also recognize the historic significance and economic prominence of these companies in communities all across Michigan and all across the country.

I thought about the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose livelihoods are still connected to the American auto industry, and the impact on an already struggling economy, especially right here in Michigan.  So I said that if Chrysler and GM were willing to fundamentally restructure their businesses and make the hard choices necessary to become competitive now and in the future, it was a process worth supporting.

Now today, after a painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice, both GM and Chrysler have emerged from bankruptcy.  Remember, folks said there was no way they could do it?  They've gotten it done already, in record time -- far faster than anybody thought possible.  They've got a leaner structure, they've got new management, and a viable vision of how to compete and win in the 21st century.  Those sacrifices were shared among all the stakeholders:  workers and management; creditors and shareholders; retirees and communities.  And together, they've made the rebirth of Chrysler and GM possible.

It was the right thing to do.

But even with this positive news, the hard truth is, is that some of the jobs that have been lost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back.  They're the casualties of a changing economy.  In some cases, just increased productivity in the plants themselves means that some jobs aren't going to return.  And that only underscores the importance of generating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones that we've lost, and of preparing our workers to fill the jobs they create.  For even before this recession hit, we were faced with an economy that was simply not creating or sustaining enough new, well-paying jobs.

So now is the time to change all that.  What we face is far more than a passing crisis.  This is a transformative moment.  And in this moment we must do what other generations have done.  It's not the time to shrink from the challenges we face or put off tough decisions.  That's what Washington has done for decades, and it's exactly why I ran for President -- to change that mindset.  Now is the time to build a firmer, stronger foundation for growth that will not only withstand future economic storms, but that will help us thrive and compete in a global economy.  To build that foundation, we have to slow the growth of health care costs that are driving us into debt.  We're going to have to do that, and there's going to be a major debate over the next three weeks.  And don't be fooled by folks trying to scare you, saying we can't change the health care system.  We have no choice but to change the health care system, because right now it's broken for too many Americans.

We're going to have to make tough choices necessary to bring down deficits.  But don't let folks fool you -- the best way to start bringing down deficits is to get control of our health care costs, which is why we need reform.

Now is the time to create the jobs of the future by growing industries, including a new clean energy economy.  And Jennifer Granholm has been all on top of this as the governor of Michigan.  She is bring cleaning [sic] energy jobs right here to Michigan, and we've got to support her in that effort.

I want Michigan to build windmills and wind turbines and solar panels and biofuel plants and energy-efficient light bulbs and weatherize all our -- because, Michigan, you know bad weather.  So you can be all on top of weatherizing.  You need to weatherize.  I know about that in Chicago too.

But we also have to ensure that we're educating and preparing our people for the new jobs of the 21st century.  We've got to prepare our people with the skills they need to compete in this global economy. Time and again, when we placed our bet for the future on education, we have prospered as a result -- by tapping the incredible innovative and generative potential of a skilled American workforce.  That's what happened when President Lincoln signed into law legislation creating the land grant colleges, which not only transformed higher education, but also our entire economy.  That's what took place when President Roosevelt signed the GI Bill which helped educate a generation, and ushered in an era of unprecedented prosperity.  That was the foundation for the American middle class.

And that's why, at the start of my administration I set a goal for America:  By 2020, this nation will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.  We used to have that.  We're going to have it again. And we've begun to take historic steps to achieve this goal.  Already we've increased Pell grants by $500. We've created a $2,500 tax credit for four years of college tuition. We've simplified student aid applications and ensured that aid is not based on the income of a job that you just lost. A new GI Bill of Rights for the 21st century is beginning to help soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan to begin a new life -- in a new economy.  And the recovery plan has helped close state budget shortfalls -- which put enormous pressure on public universities and community colleges -- at the same time making historic investments in school libraries and classrooms and facilities all across America.  So we've already taken some steps that are building the foundation for a 21st century education system here in America, one that will allow us to compete with China and India and everybody else all around the world.

But today I'm announcing the most significant down payment yet on reaching the goal of having the highest college graduation rate of any nation in the world.  We're going to achieve this in the next 10 years.  And it's called the American Graduation Initiative.  It will reform and strengthen community colleges like this one from coast to coast so they get the resources that students and schools need -- and the results workers and businesses demand.  Through this plan, we seek to help an additional 5 million Americans earn degrees and certificates in the next decade -- 5 million.

Not since the passage of the original GI Bill and the work of President Truman's Commission on Higher Education -- which helped to double the number of community colleges and increase by seven-fold enrollment in those colleges -- have we taken such a historic step on behalf of community colleges in America.  And let me be clear:  We pay for this plan -- this isn't adding to the deficit; we're paying for this plan -- by ending the wasteful subsidies we currently provide to banks and private lenders for student loans.  That will save tens of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.  Instead of lining the pockets of special interests, it's time this money went towards the interests of higher education in America.  That's what my administration is committed to doing.

Now, I know that for a long time there have been politicians who have spoken of training as a silver bullet and college as a cure-all.  It's not, and we know that.  I can't tell you how many workers who've been laid off, you talk to them about training and they say, ""Training for what?""  So I understand the frustrations that a lot of people have, especially if the training is not well designed for the specific jobs that are being created out there.

But we know that in the coming years, jobs requiring at least an associate degree are projected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college experience.  We will not fill those jobs -- or even keep those jobs here in America -- without the training offered by community colleges.  That's why I want to applaud Governor Granholm for the No Worker Left Behind program.  It's providing up to two years' worth of free tuition at community colleges and universities across the state.  The rest of the country should learn from the effort.

This is training to become a medical technician, or a health IT worker, or a lab specialist, or a nurse.  In fact, 59 percent of all new nurses come from community colleges.  This is training to install solar panels and build those wind turbines we were talking about and develop a smarter electricity grid.  And this is the kind of education that more and more Americans are using to improve their skills and broaden their horizons.  Many young people are saving money by spending two years at community college before heading to a four-year college.  And more workers who have lost their jobs -- or fear losing a job -- are seeking an edge at schools like this one.

At the same time, community colleges are under increasing pressure to cap enrollments and scrap courses and cut costs as states and municipalities face budget shortfalls.  And this is in addition to the challenges you face in the best of times, as these schools receive far less funding per student than typical four-year colleges and universities.  So community colleges are an undervalued asset in our country.  Not only is that not right, it's not smart.  That's why I've asked Dr. Jill Biden -- who happens to be a relation of the Vice President, Joe Biden, but who is also a community college educator for more than 16 years -- to promote community colleges and help us make community colleges stronger.  And that's why we're putting in place this American Graduation Initiative.

Let me describe for you the specifics of what we're going to do.  Number one, we will offer competitive grants, challenging community colleges to pursue innovative, results-oriented strategies in exchange for federal funding.  We'll fund programs that connect students looking for jobs with businesses that are looking to hire.  We'll challenge these schools to find new and better ways to help students catch up on the basics, like math and science, that are essential to our competitiveness.  We'll put colleges and employers together to create programs that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom.

These are all kinds of -- there are all kinds of examples of what's possible.  We've seen Cisco, for example, working with community colleges to prepare students and workers for jobs ranging from work in broadband to health IT.  We know that the most successful community colleges are those that partner with the private sector.  So we want to encourage more companies to work with schools to build these type of relationships.  That way, when somebody goes through a training program, they know that there's a job at the end of that training.

We'll also create a new research center with a simple mission:  to measure what works and what doesn't.  All too often, we don't know what happens when somebody walks out of a classroom and onto the factory floor or into the library or -- the laboratory or the office.  And that means businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth.  And schools themselves don't have the facts to make informed choices about which programs receive -- achieve results and which programs don't.  And this is important, not just for businesses and colleges, but for students and workers, as well.  If a parent is going to spend time in the classroom and away from his or her family -- especially after a long day at work -- that degree really has to mean something.  They have to know that when they get that degree, this is going to help advance their goals.  If a worker is going to spend two years training to enter into a whole new profession, that certificate has to mean that he or she is ready, and that businesses are ready to hire.

In addition, we want to propose new funding for innovative strategies that promote not just enrollment in a community college program, but completion of that program.  See, more than half -- more than half of all students who enter community college to earn an associate degree, or transfer to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail to reach their goal.  That's not just a waste of a valuable resource, that's a tragedy for these students.  Oftentimes they've taken out debt and they don't get the degree, but they still have to pay back the debt.  And it's a disaster for our economy.

So we'll fund programs that track student progress inside and outside the classroom.  Let's figure out what's keeping students from crossing that finish line, and then put in place reforms that will remove those barriers.  Maybe it becomes too difficult for a parent to be away from home, or too expensive for a waiter or a nurse to miss a shift.  Maybe a young student just isn't sure if her education will lead to employment.  The point is, we need to figure out solutions for these kinds of challenges -- because facing these impediments shouldn't prevent you from reaching your potential.

All right, so that's a big chunk of this first part of this initiative.  The second part:  We're going to back $10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild college classrooms and buildings all across the country. All too often, community colleges are treated like the stepchild of the higher education system; they're an afterthought, if they're thought of at all.  And that means schools are often years behind in the facilities they provide, which means, in a 21st century economy, they're years behind in the education they can offer.  That's a mistake and it's one that we'll help to correct.  Through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a more affordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on the funds in the recovery plan that are already helping to renovate schools, including community colleges all across the country.  And by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training that they're providing, guess what?  You also have to hire some workers and some tradesmen and women to do the work on those schools.  So it means it's putting people to work in Michigan right here right now.

Number three:  Even as we repair bricks and mortar, we have an opportunity to build a new virtual infrastructure to complement the education and training community colleges can offer.  So we're going to support the creation of a new online, open-source clearinghouse of courses so that community colleges across the country can offer more classes without building more classrooms.  And this will make a big difference especially for rural campuses that a lot of times have struggled -- attract -- have to struggle to attract students and faculty.  And this will make it possible for a professor to complement his lecture with an online exercise, or for a student who can't be away from her family to still keep up with her coursework.  We don't know where this kind of experiment will lead, but that's exactly why we ought to try it because I think there's a possibility that online education can provide especially for people who are already in the workforce and want to retrain the chance to upgrade their skills without having to quit their job.

So let me say this more:  The road to recovery, the road to prosperity, is going to be hard.  It was never going to be easy.  When I was sworn in, we were seeing 700 [thousand] jobs lost that month.  Then we had the same amount lost for two more consecutive months.  Now we've got an average of about 400,000 jobs lost -- but we're still losing too many jobs.  We will get to the point where we're not losing jobs, but then we've got to start getting to the point where we're actually creating jobs.

And it's going to take time.  There are going to be false starts and there are going to be setbacks.  But I am confident that we can meet the challenges we face, because that's what we've always done.  That's what America does.  We hit some challenges, we fuss and argue about it, and then we go ahead and go about the business of solving our problems.  That's what we see on display right here at Macomb Community College.  That's what I've seen at colleges and universities all across this country.  At every juncture in our history when we've been challenged, we have summoned the resilience and the industriousness -- that can-do American spirit -- that has allowed us to succeed in the face of even the toughest odds.

That's what we can and must do now, not just to overcome this crisis, but to leave something better behind, to lay a foundation on which our children and our grandchildren can prosper and take responsibility for their future -- just as the students at this school, at this difficult moment, are taking responsibility for theirs.

I am absolutely confident that if I've got your help, that we can make it happen, and we are going to see a stronger, more prosperous Michigan in the years to come.

Thank you very much, Warren.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.
","Obama Unveils Initiative

To Boost Community Colleges

President Barack Obama announced a 10-year, $12 billion community-college initiative designed to boost graduation rates, improve facilities and develop new technology.

Speaking in Warren, Mich., a blue-collar Detroit suburb, Mr. Obama framed the initiative as an opportunity to change the face of Rust Belt states that have traditionally relied heavily on unskilled labor.

The effort marks an increase in direct federal spending on community colleges. A report by the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank, estimated the federal government provides community colleges with $2 billion a year in direct support, a tenth of what it spends on public-four year schools. Administration officials said they plan to fund the initiative with savings from proposed changes in the student-loan program.

Democratic Rep. George Miller, chairman of the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee, is expected to introduce legislation Wednesday backing Mr. Obama's proposal to eliminate private lenders from the federal loan program and make the government the sole provider of such loans.
","The Obama administration's proposal to provide $12 billion to community colleges is widely seen by educators as explicit recognition of the two-year colleges' importance to the economy.

""For years, the Washington conversation about public education has all been about k-12, and increasing access to college,"" said Andy Van Kleunen, executive director of The Workforce Alliance, a national group of employers, unions, and education and training providers. ""This changes the whole game.""

President Obama's goal of five million more community college graduates by 2020 would require nearly doubling graduation rates at most community colleges.

According to the American Association of Community Colleges, more than six million students a year enroll for credit at the nation's 1,200 community colleges, but only about 555,000 a year earn a two-year degree, and another 295,000 a year earn a vocational certificate.

""This is the higher education equivalent of the moon shot,"" said Jamie Merisotis, president of the Lumina Foundation, which supports community-college initiatives. ""The president is putting a bet on one sector to get a lot more graduates. They want to have a measurable impact on work force development.""

Even before the announcement Tuesday, the Obama administration had put unprecedented emphasis on two-year institutions. Martha J. Kanter, the former chancellor of the Foothill-De Anza Community College district in California, was tapped for the second-highest job in the Education Department.

Secretary of Education Arne Duncan chose a Miami community college for his first official visit to an institution of higher education, and last month Mr. Duncan announced a $7 million grant program for community colleges to train laid-off auto workers and other displaced workers. And it has not hurt that Jill Biden, the vice president's wife, teaches at a community college.

Historically, the mission of community colleges has been to provide postsecondary schooling -- usually through open admissions -- for low-income students who have few other options. Most community-college students are employed adults who attend classes part-time; according to some studies, more than half need remedial courses before they can tackle college-level work.

The Obama proposal would require stronger efforts to retain students until graduation, and encourage partnerships between community colleges and employers to offer work force training.

""Higher retention rates certainly wouldn't be possible without the funding, when most community colleges are facing large enrollment increases just as states are cutting their budgets,"" said Debra Bragg, co-director of the Forum on the Future of Public Education at the University of Illinois.

Ms. Bragg predicted that most new graduates produced under the Obama proposal would not get two-year degrees. Instead, she said, they would complete certificate programs, usually lasting six months to a year, offering specific credentials for what are known as middle-skill jobs that require more than a high school diploma, but less than a four-year degree.

""There's all kinds of jobs in health care, information technology, in some regions, manufacturing or transportation logistics,"" Ms. Bragg said.

10,10,2009-09-24-UNSpeech.txt,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen:

It is my honor to address you for the first time as the 44th President of the United States.  I -- I come before you humbled by the responsibility that the American people have placed upon me, mindful of the enormous challenges of our moment in history, and determined to act boldly and collectively on behalf of justice and prosperity at home and abroad.

I have been in office for just nine months -- though some days it seems a lot longer.  I am well aware of the expectations that accompany my presidency around the world.  These expectations are not about me.  Rather, they are rooted, I believe, in a discontent with a status quo that has allowed us to be increasingly defined by our differences, and outpaced by our problems.  But they are also rooted in hope -- the hope that real change is possible, and the hope that America will be a leader in bringing about such change.

I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust.  Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country.  Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others.  And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.

Now, like all of you, my responsibility is to act in the interest of my nation and my people, and I will never apologize for defending those interests.  But it is my deeply held belief that in the year 2009 -- more than at any point in human history -- the interests of nations and peoples are shared.  The religious convictions that we hold in our hearts can forge new bonds among people, or they can tear us apart.  The technology we harness can light the path to peace, or forever darken it.  The energy we use can sustain our planet, or destroy it.  What happens to the hope of a single child -- anywhere -- can enrich our world, or impoverish it.

In this hall, we come from many places, but we share a common future.  No longer do we have the luxury of indulging our differences to the exclusion of the work that we must do together.  I have carried this message from London to Ankara; from Port of Spain to Moscow; from Accra to Cairo; and it is what I will speak about today -- because the time has come for the world to move in a new direction.  We must embrace a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and our work must begin now.

We know the future will be forged by deeds and not simply words.  Speeches alone will not solve our problems -- it will take persistent action.  For those who question the character and cause of my nation, I ask you to look at the concrete actions we have taken in just nine months.

On my first day in office, I prohibited -- without exception or equivocation -- the use of torture by the United States of America.  I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed, and we are doing the hard work of forging a framework to combat extremism within the rule of law.  Every nation must know: America will live its values, and we will lead by example.

We have set a clear and focused goal:  to work with all members of this body to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies -- a network that has killed thousands of people of many faiths and nations, and that plotted to blow up this very building.  In Afghanistan and Pakistan, we and many nations here are helping these governments develop the capacity to take the lead in this effort, while working to advance opportunity and security for their people.

In Iraq, we are responsibly ending a war.  We have removed American combat brigades from Iraqi cities, and set a deadline of next August to remove all our combat brigades from Iraqi territory.  And I have made clear that we will help Iraqis transition to full responsibility for their future, and keep our commitment to remove all American troops by the end of 2011.

I have outlined a comprehensive agenda to seek the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.  In Moscow, the United States and Russia announced that we would pursue substantial reductions in our strategic warheads and launchers.  At the Conference on Disarmament, we agreed on a work plan to negotiate an end to the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons.  And this week, my Secretary of State will become the first senior American representative to the annual Members Conference of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

Upon taking office, I appointed a Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, and America has worked steadily and aggressively to advance the cause of two states -- Israel and Palestine -- in which peace and security take root, and the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians are respected. 
 
To confront climate change, we have invested $80 billion in clean energy.  We have substantially increased our fuel-efficiency standards.  We have provided new incentives for conservation, launched an energy partnership across the Americas, and moved from a bystander to a leader in international climate negotiations.

To overcome an economic crisis that touches every corner of the world, we worked with the G20 nations to forge a coordinated international response of over $2 trillion in stimulus to bring the global economy back from the brink.  We mobilized resources that helped prevent the crisis from spreading further to developing countries.  And we joined with others to launch a $20 billion global food security initiative that will lend a hand to those who need it most, and help them build their own capacity.
 
We've also re-engaged the United Nations.  We have paid our bills.  We have joined the Human Rights Council.  We have signed the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We have fully embraced the Millennium Development Goals.  And we address our priorities here, in this institution  -- for instance, through the Security Council meeting that I will chair tomorrow on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and through the issues that I will discuss today.

This is what we have already done.  But this is just a beginning.  Some of our actions have yielded progress.  Some have laid the groundwork for progress in the future.  But make no mistake:  This cannot solely be America's endeavor.  Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone.  We have sought -- in word and deed -- a new era of engagement with the world.  And now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges.

Now, if we are honest with ourselves, we need to admit that we are not living up to that responsibility.  Consider the course that we're on if we fail to confront the status quo:  Extremists sowing terror in pockets of the world; protracted conflicts that grind on and on; genocide; mass atrocities; more nations with nuclear weapons; melting ice caps and ravaged populations; persistent poverty and pandemic disease.  I say this not to sow fear, but to state a fact:  The magnitude of our challenges has yet to be met by the measure of our actions.

This body was founded on the belief that the nations of the world could solve their problems together.  Franklin Roosevelt, who died before he could see his vision for this institution become a reality, put it this way -- and I quote:  ""The structure of world peace cannot be the work of one man, or one party, or one nationâ¦.  It cannot be a peace of large nations -- or of small nations.  It must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort of the whole world.""

The cooperative effort of the whole world.  Those words ring even more true today, when it is not simply peace, but our very health and prosperity that we hold in common.  Yet we also know that this body is made up of sovereign states.  And sadly, but not surprisingly, this body has often become a forum for sowing discord instead of forging common ground; a venue for playing politics and exploiting grievances rather than solving problems. After all, it is easy to walk up to this podium and point figures -- point fingers and stoke divisions.  Nothing is easier than blaming others for our troubles, and absolving ourselves of responsibility for our choices and our actions.  Anybody can do that.  Responsibility and leadership in the 21st century demand more. 

In an era when our destiny is shared, power is no longer a zero-sum game.  No one nation can or should try to dominate another nation.  No world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will succeed.  No balance of power among nations will hold.  The traditional divisions between nations of the South and the North make no sense in an interconnected world; nor do alignments of nations rooted in the cleavages of a long-gone Cold War.

The time has come to realize that the old habits, the old arguments, are irrelevant to the challenges faced by our people. They lead nations to act in opposition to the very goals that they claim to pursue -- and to vote, often in this body, against the interests of their own people.  They build up walls between us and the future that our people seek, and the time has come for those walls to come down.  Together, we must build new coalitions that bridge old divides -- coalitions of different faiths and creeds; of north and south, east, west, black, white, and brown.

The choice is ours.  We can be remembered as a generation that chose to drag the arguments of the 20th century into the 21st; that put off hard choices, refused to look ahead, failed to keep pace because we defined ourselves by what we were against instead of what we were for.  Or we can be a generation that chooses to see the shoreline beyond the rough waters ahead; that comes together to serve the common interests of human beings, and finally gives meaning to the promise embedded in the name given to this institution:  the United Nations.

That is the future America wants -- a future of peace and prosperity that we can only reach if we recognize that all nations have rights, but all nations have responsibilities as well.  That is the bargain that makes this work.  That must be the guiding principle of international cooperation.

Today, let me put forward four pillars that I believe are fundamental to the future that we want for our children:  non-proliferation and disarmament; the promotion of peace and security; the preservation of our planet; and a global economy that advances opportunity for all people.

First, we must stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and seek the goal of a world without them.

This institution was founded at the dawn of the atomic age, in part because man's capacity to kill had to be contained.  For decades, we averted disaster, even under the shadow of a superpower stand-off.  But today, the threat of proliferation is growing in scope and complexity.  If we fail to act, we will invite nuclear arms races in every region, and the prospect of wars and acts of terror on a scale that we can hardly imagine.

A fragile consensus stands in the way of this frightening outcome, and that is the basic bargain that shapes the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  It says that all nations have the right to peaceful nuclear energy; that nations with nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move toward disarmament; and those without them have the responsibility to forsake them.  The next 12 months could be pivotal in determining whether this compact will be strengthened or will slowly dissolve.

America intends to keep our end of the bargain.  We will pursue a new agreement with Russia to substantially reduce our strategic warheads and launchers.  We will move forward with ratification of the Test Ban Treaty, and work with others to bring the treaty into force so that nuclear testing is permanently prohibited.  We will complete a Nuclear Posture Review that opens the door to deeper cuts and reduces the role of nuclear weapons.  And we will call upon countries to begin negotiations in January on a treaty to end the production of fissile material for weapons.

I will also host a summit next April that reaffirms each nation's responsibility to secure nuclear material on its territory, and to help those who can't -- because we must never allow a single nuclear device to fall into the hands of a violent extremist.  And we will work to strengthen the institutions and initiatives that combat nuclear smuggling and theft.

All of this must support efforts to strengthen the NPT.  Those nations that refuse to live up to their obligations must face consequences.  Let me be clear, this is not about singling out individual nations -- it is about standing up for the rights of all nations that do live up to their responsibilities.  Because a world in which IAEA inspections are avoided and the United Nation's demands are ignored will leave all people less safe, and all nations less secure.

In their actions to date, the governments of North Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous slope.  We respect their rights as members of the community of nations.  I've said before and I will repeat, I am committed to diplomacy that opens a path to greater prosperity and more secure peace for both nations if they live up to their obligations.

But if the governments of Iran and North Korea choose to ignore international standards; if they put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the security and opportunity of their own people; if they are oblivious to the dangers of escalating nuclear arms races in both East Asia and the Middle East -- then they must be held accountable.  The world must stand together to demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise, and that treaties will be enforced.  We must insist that the future does not belong to fear.

That brings me to the second pillar for our future:  the pursuit of peace.

The United Nations was born of the belief that the people of the world can live their lives, raise their families, and resolve their differences peacefully.  And yet we know that in too many parts of the world, this ideal remains an abstraction -- a distant dream.  We can either accept that outcome as inevitable, and tolerate constant and crippling conflict, or we can recognize that the yearning for peace is universal, and reassert our resolve to end conflicts around the world.

That effort must begin with an unshakeable determination that the murder of innocent men, women and children will never be tolerated.  On this, no one can be -- there can be no dispute.  The violent extremists who promote conflict by distorting faith have discredited and isolated themselves.  They offer nothing but hatred and destruction.  In confronting them, America will forge lasting partnerships to target terrorists, share intelligence, and coordinate law enforcement and protect our people.  We will permit no safe haven for al Qaeda to launch attacks from Afghanistan or any other nation.  We will stand by our friends on the front lines, as we and many nations will do in pledging support for the Pakistani people tomorrow.  And we will pursue positive engagement that builds bridges among faiths, and new partnerships for opportunity.

Our efforts to promote peace, however, cannot be limited to defeating violent extremists.  For the most powerful weapon in our arsenal is the hope of human beings -- the belief that the future belongs to those who would build and not destroy; the confidence that conflicts can end and a new day can begin.

And that is why we will support -- we will strengthen our support for effective peacekeeping, while energizing our efforts to prevent conflicts before they take hold.  We will pursue a lasting peace in Sudan through support for the people of Darfur and the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, so that we secure the peace that the Sudanese people deserve. And in countries ravaged by violence -- from Haiti to Congo to East Timor -- we will work with the U.N. and other partners to support an enduring peace.

I will also continue to seek a just and lasting peace between Israel, Palestine, and the Arab world.  We will continue to work on that issue.  Yesterday, I had a constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.  We have made some progress.  Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security.  Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the Palestinians.  As a result of these efforts on both sides, the economy in the West Bank has begun to grow.  But more progress is needed.  We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel, and we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. 

The time has come -- the time has come to re-launch negotiations without preconditions that address the permanent status issues:  security for Israelis and Palestinians, borders, refugees, and Jerusalem.  And the goal is clear:  Two states living side by side in peace and security -- a Jewish state of Israel, with true security for all Israelis; and a viable, independent Palestinian state with contiguous territory that ends the occupation that began in 1967, and realizes the potential of the Palestinian people. 

As we pursue this goal, we will also pursue peace between Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Syria, and a broader peace between Israel and its many neighbors.  In pursuit of that goal, we will develop regional initiatives with multilateral participation, alongside bilateral negotiations. 
         
Now, I am not naÃ¯ve.  I know this will be difficult.  But all of us -- not just the Israelis and the Palestinians, but all of us -- must decide whether we are serious about peace, or whether we will only lend it lip service.  To break the old patterns, to break the cycle of insecurity and despair, all of us must say publicly what we would acknowledge in private.  The United States does Israel no favors when we fail to couple an unwavering commitment to its security with an insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims and rights of the Palestinians. And -- And nations within this body do the Palestinians no favors when they choose vitriolic attacks against Israel over constructive willingness to recognize Israel's legitimacy and its right to exist in peace and security.

We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us.  It's not paid by politicians.  It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night.  It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own.  These are all God's children.  And after all the politics and all the posturing, this is about the right of every human being to live with dignity and security.  That is a lesson embedded in the three great faiths that call one small slice of Earth the Holy Land.  And that is why, even though there will be setbacks and false starts and tough days, I will not waver in my pursuit of peace. 

Third, we must recognize that in the 21st century, there will be no peace unless we take responsibility for the preservation of our planet.  And I thank the Secretary General for hosting the subject of climate change yesterday.

The danger posed by climate change cannot be denied.  Our responsibility to meet it must not be deferred.  If we continue down our current course, every member of this Assembly will see irreversible changes within their borders.  Our efforts to end conflicts will be eclipsed by wars over refugees and resources.  Development will be devastated by drought and famine.  Land that human beings have lived on for millennia will disappear.  Future generations will look back and wonder why we refused to act; why we failed to pass on -- why we failed to pass on an environment that was worthy of our inheritance.

And that is why the days when America dragged its feet on this issue are over.  We will move forward with investments to transform our energy economy, while providing incentives to make clean energy the profitable kind of energy.  We will press ahead with deep cuts in emissions to reach the goals that we set for 2020, and eventually 2050.  We will continue to promote renewable energy and efficiency, and share new technologies with countries around the world.  And we will seize every opportunity for progress to address this threat in a cooperative effort with the entire world. 

And those wealthy nations that did so much damage to the environment in the 20th century must accept our obligation to lead.  But responsibility does not end there.  While we must acknowledge the need for differentiated responses, any effort to curb carbon emissions must include the fast-growing carbon emitters who can do more to reduce their air pollution without inhibiting growth.  And any effort that fails to help the poorest nations both adapt to the problems that climate change have already wrought and help them travel a path of clean development simply will not work.

It's hard to change something as fundamental as how we use energy.  I know that.  It's even harder to do so in the midst of a global recession.  Certainly, it will be tempting to sit back and wait for others to move first.  But we cannot make this journey unless we all move forward together.  As we head into Copenhagen, let us resolve to focus on what each of us can do for the sake of our common future.

And this leads me to the final pillar that must fortify our future:  a global economy that advances opportunity for all people.

The world is still recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  In America, we see the engine of growth beginning to churn, and yet many still struggle to find a job or pay their bills.  Across the globe, we find promising signs, but little certainty about what lies ahead.  And far too many people in far too many places live through the daily crises that challenge our humanity -- the despair of an empty stomach; the thirst brought on by dwindling water supplies; the injustice of a child dying from a treatable disease; or a mother losing her life as she gives birth.

In Pittsburgh, we will work with the world's largest economies to chart a course for growth that is balanced and sustained.  That means vigilance to ensure that we do not let up until our people are back to work.  That means taking steps to rekindle demand so that global recovery can be sustained.  And that means setting new rules of the road and strengthening regulation for all financial centers, so that we put an end to the greed and the excess and the abuse that led us into this disaster, and prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again.

At a time of such interdependence, we have a moral and pragmatic interest, however, in broader questions of development -- the questions of development that existed even before this crisis happened.  And so America will continue our historic effort to help people feed themselves.  We have set aside $63 billion to carry forward the fight against HIV/AIDS, to end deaths from tuberculosis and malaria, to eradicate polio, and to strengthen public health systems.  We are joining with other countries to contribute H1N1 vaccines to the World Health Organization.  We will integrate more economies into a system of global trade.  We will support the Millennium Development Goals, and approach next year's summit with a global plan to make them a reality.  And we will set our sights on the eradication of extreme poverty in our time.

Now is the time for all of us to do our part.  Growth will not be sustained or shared unless all nations embrace their responsibilities.  And that means that wealthy nations must open their markets to more goods and extend a hand to those with less, while reforming international institutions to give more nations a greater voice.  And developing nations must root out the corruption that is an obstacle to progress -- for opportunity cannot thrive where individuals are oppressed and business have to pay bribes.  That is why we support honest police and independent judges; civil society and a vibrant private sector.  Our goal is simple:  a global economy in which growth is sustained, and opportunity is available to all.

Now, the changes that I've spoken about today will not be easy to make.  And they will not be realized simply by leaders like us coming together in forums like this, as useful as that may be.  For as in any assembly of members, real change can only come through the people we represent.  That is why we must do the hard work to lay the groundwork for progress in our own capitals. That's where we will build the consensus to end conflicts and to harness technology for peaceful purposes, to change the way we use energy, and to promote growth that can be sustained and shared.

I believe that the people of the world want this future for their children.  And that is why we must champion those principles which ensure that governments reflect the will of the people.  These principles cannot be afterthoughts -- democracy and human rights are essential to achieving each of the goals that I've discussed today, because governments of the people and by the people are more likely to act in the broader interests of their own people, rather than narrow interests of those in power.

The test of our leadership will not be the degree to which we feed the fears and old hatreds of our people.  True leadership will not be measured by the ability to muzzle dissent, or to intimidate and harass political opponents at home.  The people of the world want change.  They will not long tolerate those who are on the wrong side of history.

This Assembly's Charter commits each of us -- and I quote -- ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women.""  Among those rights is the freedom to speak your mind and worship as you please; the promise of equality of the races, and the opportunity for women and girls to pursue their own potential; the ability of citizens to have a say in how you are governed, and to have confidence in the administration of justice.  For just as no nation should be forced to accept the tyranny of another nation, no individual should be forced to accept the tyranny of their own people. 

As an African American, I will never forget that I would not be here today without the steady pursuit of a more perfect union in my country.  And that guides my belief that no matter how dark the day may seem, transformative change can be forged by those who choose to side with justice.  And I pledge that America will always stand with those who stand up for their dignity and their rights -- for the student who seeks to learn; the voter who demands to be heard; the innocent who longs to be free; the oppressed who yearns to be equal.

Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation from the outside. Each society must search for its own path, and no path is perfect.  Each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its people and in its past traditions.  And I admit that America has too often been selective in its promotion of democracy.  But that does not weaken our commitment; it only reinforces it.  There are basic principles that are universal; there are certain truths which are self-evident -- and the United States of America will never waver in our efforts to stand up for the right of people everywhere to determine their own destiny. 

Sixty-five years ago, a weary Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the American people in his fourth and final inaugural address. After years of war, he sought to sum up the lessons that could be drawn from the terrible suffering, the enormous sacrifice that had taken place.  ""We have learned,"" he said, ""to be citizens of the world, members of the human community.""

The United Nations was built by men and women like Roosevelt from every corner of the world -- from Africa and Asia, from Europe to the Americas.  These architects of international cooperation had an idealism that was anything but naÃ¯ve -- it was rooted in the hard-earned lessons of war; rooted in the wisdom that nations could advance their interests by acting together instead of splitting apart.

Now it falls to us -- for this institution will be what we make of it.  The United Nations does extraordinary good around the world -- feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, mending  places that have been broken.  But it also struggles to enforce its will, and to live up to the ideals of its founding.

I believe that those imperfections are not a reason to walk away from this institution -- they are a calling to redouble our efforts.  The United Nations can either be a place where we bicker about outdated grievances, or forge common ground; a place where we focus on what drives us apart, or what brings us together; a place where we indulge tyranny, or a source of moral authority.  In short, the United Nations can be an institution that is disconnected from what matters in the lives of our citizens, or it can be an indispensable factor in advancing the interests of the people we serve. 

We have reached a pivotal moment.  The United States stands ready to begin a new chapter of international cooperation -- one that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of all nations.  And so, with confidence in our cause, and with a commitment to our values, we call on all nations to join us in building the future that our people so richly deserve.

Thank you very much, everybody.
","The difficulty of President Barack Obama's efforts to contain Iran's nuclear program came into sharp relief at the U.N. General Assembly, as the U.S. both pushed ahead with its engagement overtures toward Iran even while American diplomats walked out of a speech given by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

President Obama scored a potential victory in his diplomatic engagement with Iran by gaining what appeared to be a commitment from Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to exact economic sanctions against Tehran if it doesn't compromise on its rapidly expanding nuclear program. The severity of sanctions Russia would agree to remained unclear, however.

U.S. officials and members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, held discussions Wednesday to forge a united approach toward Iran ahead of a crucial Oct. 1 meeting with Iran in Geneva. It will be the first direct engagement between the Obama administration and Mr. Ahmadinejad's government on the nuclear issue.

The U.S. and its allies have decided to present Iran once more with a version of an offer they have made previously: They would halt efforts to enact new economic sanctions against Tehran in exchange for it freezing its production of nuclear fuel at current levels, said senior U.S. and European officials.

Russian support for sanctions is viewed as crucial in pressuring Tehran to relent. ""The Russian position is simple. . . . Sanctions rarely lead to productive results. But in some cases sanctions are inevitable,"" Mr. Medvedev said following a meeting with Mr. Obama on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.

Earlier this month, Mr. Obama announced he was scrapping a U.S. plan to base missile interceptors and radar in Poland and the Czech Republic. The move was widely viewed as a concession to Moscow aimed at gaining its support for a tougher line on Tehran. Just last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested his government was taking the sanctions card off the table.

Mr. Ahmadinejad illustrated during his speech to the U.N. General Assembly some of the difficulties the Obama administration could have negotiating with Tehran.

The Iranian leader blasted the West and Israel for corrupting the global economy and called for a wholesale restructuring of the international order. He also barely mentioned his own government's nuclear activities while calling for a moratorium on the world's atomic weapons.

""The engine of unbridled capitalism with its unfair system of thought has reached the end of the road and is unable to move,"" he said, in prepared remarks. He continued, ""By the grace of God, Marxism is gone. It is now history. The expansionist capitalism will certainly have the same fate.""

Mr. Ahmadinejad complained that a ""small minority"" controls politics, economics and culture across much of the world. Mr. Ahamdinejad's rant led the U.S. and Canadian delegations attending the event to walk out of the hall. ""It is disappointing that Mr. Ahmadinejad has once again chosen to espouse hateful, offensive and anti-Semitic rhetoric,"" Mark Kornblau, spokesman for the U.S. mission to the U.N., said in a statement.

In one sign of potential compromise, however, Iran's president said: ""Our nation is prepared to warmly shake all those hands which are honestly extended to us. No nation can claim to be free from the need to change and reform in this journey towards perfectness.""

The U.S. and its negotiating partners, meanwhile, worked to fine-tune their negotiating position toward Tehran ahead the Oct. 1 meeting.

British Foreign Secretary David Miliband announced alongside Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the international community's negotiating framework with Iran will largely be based on a freeze-for-freeze proposal it submitted to Iran in June. That offer specifically seeks Iran's freezing of its uranium-enrichment activities at current levels for six weeks, in return for the international community not exacting any new economic sanctions.

The initial freeze could then form the basis of a more expansive negotiation based on the international community offering economic sanctions to Tehran in exchange for its permanently suspending its industrial-scale production of nuclear fuel. ""We reaffirm our proposal of June 2008,"" Mr. Miliband said. President George W. Bush's administration and European nations sought to kick-start dialogue with Tehran using the freeze-for-freeze formula but were regularly rebuffed by President Ahmadinejad. His predecessor, the reformist cleric, Mohammad Khatami, agreed in 2003 to freeze Tehran's uranium-enrichment work. But he restarted the program in 2005 as negotiations stalled.

U.S. and European officials said they are guarded about the willingness of Mr. Ahmadinejad's government to agree to a nuclear freeze. In recent weeks, Iranian officials have publicly ruled out bargaining away its enrichment activities. U.S. and European officials are increasingly describing the Oct. 1 meeting in Geneva as a make-or-break point in their efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue diplomatically.

Many officials are now citing the end of the year as the deadline for President Obama's and the West's overtures to Tehran; Mr. Obama had originally set the deadline as this month.

Should Iran rebuff the offer of the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany in Geneva, the following three months would be used to formalize an economic sanctions regime against Tehran.

Speaking to French television Wednesday, President Nicolas Sarkozy said after December his country is fully prepared to enact new sanctions on Tehran, either unilaterally or as part of a multilateral agreement. ""It's always necessary to talk,"" Mr. Sarkozy said from the U.N., where he also spoke to the assembly. ""But why oppose dialogue and sanctions in the case dialogue does not prosper. There will be a deadline and, in my mind, it's December.""
","President Obama, in his first visit to the opening of the United NationsGeneral Assembly, made progress Wednesday on two key issues, wringing a concession from Russia to consider tough new sanctions against Iran and securing support from Moscow and Beijing for a Security Council resolution to curb nuclear weapons.

The successes came as Mr. Obama told leaders that the United States intended to begin a new era of engagement with the world, in a sweeping address to the General Assembly in which he sought to clearly delineate differences between himself and the administration of President George W. Bush.

One of the fruits of those differences -- although White House officials were loath to acknowledge any quid pro quo publicly -- emerged during Mr. Obama's meeting on Wednesday afternoon with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, the first between the two since Mr. Obama decided to replace Mr. Bush's missile defense program in Eastern Europe with a version less threatening to Moscow.

With a beaming Mr. Obama standing next to him, Mr. Medvedev signaled for the first time that Russia would be amenable to longstanding American requests to toughen sanctions against Iran significantly if, as expected, nuclear talks scheduled for next month failed to make progress.

""I told His Excellency Mr. President that we believe we need to help Iran to take a right decision,"" Mr. Medvedev said, adding that ""sanctions rarely lead to productive results, but in some cases, sanctions are inevitable.""

White House officials could barely hide their glee. ""I couldn't have said it any better myself,"" a delighted Michael McFaul, Mr. Obama's senior adviser for democracy and Russia, told reporters after the meeting. He insisted nonetheless that the administration had not tried to buy Russia's cooperation with its decision to scrap the missile shield in Europe in favor of a reconfigured system.

Privately, several administration officials did acknowledge that missile defense might have had something to do with Moscow's newfound verbal cooperation on the Iran sanctions issue.

Whether Mr. Medvedev's words translate into strong action once the issue moves back to the Security Council remains to be seen. American officials have been disappointed before by Moscow's distaste for tough sanctions, and Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin seemed to cast doubt on the need for stronger sanctions just last week. But Mr. Obama also got another boost from Russia, as well as from China, when they agreed to support strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in a Security Council session scheduled for Thursday.

In an effort to lay the groundwork for toughening the treaty, the Obama administration circulated drafts of a resolution that ""urges"" countries to put conditions on their nuclear exports, so that international inspectors would be authorized to continue monitoring the use of some nuclear materials even if a country withdrew from the nonproliferation pact. That is a rare occurrence, but North Korea declared it was withdrawing in 2003, and inspectors were thrown out.

The Obama administration hailed the pending resolution as a significant step forward. But it would not be binding, and would become so only if the Security Council required countries to make their nuclear exports subject to such restrictions. Many countries balked at that requirement, an indication of how difficult it may prove to toughen the treaty itself when it is up for review next year.

Mr. Obama will preside over the Security Council meeting on Thursday, and is expected to call for a vote on the draft resolution. White House officials said they expected the measure to pass unanimously.

During his address to the General Assembly, Mr. Obama sought to present a kinder, gentler America willing to make nice with the world. He suggested that the United States would no longer follow the go-it-alone policies that many United Nations members complained isolated the Bush administration from the organization.

""We have re-engaged the United Nations,"" Mr. Obama said, to cheers from world leaders and delegates in the cavernous hall. ""We have paid our bills"" -- a direct reference to the former administration's practice of withholding some payment due the world body while it pressed for changes there.

But even as Mr. Obama sought to signal a different tone, it was clear that old, entrenched issues would remain, including Iran's nuclear ambitions and a Middle East peace process. And while much of his language was different and more conciliatory, the backbone of American policy on some issues remained similar to the Bush administration's.

As Mr. Bush used to do before him, for instance, Mr. Obama singled out Iran and North Korea, which he said ""threaten to take us down this dangerous slope.""

""I am committed to diplomacy that opens a path to greater prosperity and a more secure peace for both nations if they live up to their obligations,"" Mr. Obama said.

But, he added, ""if the governments of Iran and North Korea choose to ignore international standards; if they put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the security and opportunity of their own people; if they are oblivious to the dangers of escalating nuclear arms races in both East Asia and the Middle East -- then they must be held accountable.""

As he spoke, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran sat in the fifth row, showing no reaction.

But a glittering array of world leaders sat in the hall for Mr. Obama's speech, which was often interrupted by applause and the flashes of cameras, including from some delegates.

Mr. Obama said he planned to work toward a comprehensive peace deal between Israel and its Arab neighbors. He indicated again that he was impatient with the slow pace of work on interim measures like a settlement freeze. He called on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to address the tough ""final status"" issues that had bedeviled peace negotiators since 1979.

""The goal is clear,"" he said, ""two states living side by side in peace and security.""

But the difficulty of achieving that goal was also on full display on Wednesday, one day after Mr. Obama held meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and admonished them to meet in person and negotiate a peace deal. The two Middle Eastern leaders and their spokesmen spent much of the day Wednesday explaining why that could not happen soon.

In an interview on NBC, Mr. Netanyahu called Israeli settlements ""bedroom suburbs"" of Jerusalem and suggested Israel would not withdraw from all the territory it occupied after the 1967 Middle East war. Meanwhile, the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, told The Associated Press that the two sides will ""continue dealing with the Americans until we reach the agreement that will enable us to relaunch the negotiations.""

11,11,2009-10-09-NobelPeacePrize.txt,"Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, citizens of America, and citizens of the world:
 
I receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility. It's an award that speaks to our highest aspirations -- that for all the cruelty and hardship of our world, we are not mere prisoners of fate. Our actions matter, and can bend history in the direction of justice.
 
And yet, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated. In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage. Compared to some of the giants of history who've received this prize -- Schweitzer and King, Marshall and Mandela -- my accomplishments are slight. And then there are the men and women around the world who've been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice; those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering; the unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened cynics. I cannot argue with those who find these men and women -- some known, some obscure to all but those they help -- to be far more deserving of this honor than I.
 
But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars. One of these wars is winding down. The other is a conflict that America did not seek, one in which we are joined by 42 other countries -- including Norway -- in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks.
 
Still, we are at war. And I am responsible1 for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land. Some will kill; and some will be killed. And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict -- filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace, and our effort to replace one with the other.

Now these questions are not new. War, in one form or another, appeared with the first man. At the dawn of history, its morality was not questioned; it was simply a fact, like drought or disease -- the manner in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their differences.

And over time, as codes of law sought to control violence within groups, so did philosophers and clerics and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war. The concept of a ""just war"" emerged, suggesting that war is justified only when certain conditions were met: if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense; if the force used is proportional; and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence.
 
Of course, we know that for most of history, this concept of ""just war"" was rarely observed. The capacity of human beings to think up new ways to kill one another proved inexhaustible, as did our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God. Wars between armies gave way to wars between nations -- total wars in which the distinction between combatant and civilian became blurred. In the span of 30 years, such carnage would twice engulf this continent. And while it's hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the Third Reich and the Axis powers, World War II was a conflict in which the total number of civilians who died exceeded the number of soldiers who perished.
 
In the wake of such destruction, and with the advent of the nuclear age, it became clear to victor and vanquished alike that the world needed institutions to prevent another world war. And so a quarter century after the United States Senate rejected the League of Nations -- an idea for which Woodrow Wilson received this prize -- America led the world in constructing an architecture to keep the peace: a Marshall Plan, and a United Nations; mechanisms to govern the waging of war, treaties to protect human rights, prevent genocide, restrict the most dangerous weapons.
 
In many ways, these efforts succeeded. Yes, terrible wars have been fought, and atrocities committed. But there has been no Third World War. The Cold War ended with jubilant crowds dismantling a wall. Commerce has stitched much of the world together. Billions have been lifted from poverty. The ideals of liberty and self-determination, equality, and the rule of law have haltingly advanced. We are the heirs of the fortitude and foresight of generations past, and it is a legacy for which my own country is rightfully proud.

And yet, a decade into a new century, this old architecture is buckling under the weight of new threats. The world may no longer shudder at the prospect of war between two nuclear superpowers, but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe. Terrorism has long been a tactic, but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale.
 
Moreover, wars between nations have increasingly given way to wars within nations. The resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflicts; the growth of secessionist movements, insurgencies, and failed states -- all these things have increasingly trapped civilians in unending chaos. In today's wars, many more civilians are killed than soldiers; the seeds of future conflict are sown, economies are wrecked, civil societies torn asunder, refugees amassed, children scarred.
 
I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war. What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision, hard work, and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago. And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of ""just war"" and the imperatives of a just peace.
 
We must begin by acknowledging a hard truth: We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes. There will be times when nations, acting individually or in concert, will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.
 
I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago: ""Violence never brings permanent peace. It solves no social problem. It merely creates new and more complicated ones."" As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King's life work, I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence. I know there's nothing weak, nothing passive, nothing naÃ¯ve in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King.
 
But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation, I cannot be guided by their examples alone. I face the world as it is and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people. For make no mistake: Evil does exist in the world. A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler's armies. Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms. To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism. It is a recognition of history, the imperfections of man, and the limits of reason.
 
I raise this point, I begin with this point because in many countries there is a deep ambivalence about military action today -- no matter what the cause. And at times, this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of America, the world's sole military superpower.

Yet, the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions -- not just treaties and declarations -- that brought stability to a post-World War II world. Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms.  The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.
 
So yes, the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace. And yet this truth must coexist with another: that no matter how justified, war promises human tragedy. The soldier's courage and sacrifice is full of glory -- expressing devotion to country, to cause, to comrades in arms. But war itself is never glorious; and we must never trumpet it as such.
 
So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly irreconcilable truths: that war is sometimes necessary; and war at some level is an expression of human folly. Concretely, we must direct our effort to the task that President Kennedy called for long ago. ""Let us focus,"" he said, ""on a more practical, more attainable peace, based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions."" 

A gradual evolution of human institutions.

    What might this evolution look like?

        What might these practical steps be?

To begin with, I believe that all nations, strong and weak alike, must adhere to standards that govern the use of force. I, like any head of state, reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation. Nevertheless, I am convinced that adhering to standards, international standards, strengthens those who do and isolates and weakens those who don't.

The world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan, because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self-defense. Likewise, the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait -- a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression.
 
Furthermore, America -- in fact, no nation -- can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves. For when we don't, our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions, no matter how justified.

And this becomes particularly important when the purpose of military action extends beyond self-defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor. More and more, we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government, or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region.
 
I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war. Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later. That's why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace.
 
America's commitment to global security will never waver. But in a world in which threats are more diffuse and missions more complex America cannot act alone. America alone cannot secure the peace. This is true in Afghanistan. This is true in failed states like Somalia, where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering. And sadly, it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come.

The leaders and soldiers of NATO countries, and other friends and allies, demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they've shown in Afghanistan. But in many countries, there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public. I understand why war is not popular, but I also know this: The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it.

Peace requires responsibility.

Peace entails sacrifice.

That's why NATO continues to be indispensable. That's why we must strengthen U.N. and regional peacekeeping, and not leave the task to a few countries. That's why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome, to Ottawa and Sydney, to Dhaka and Kigali. We honor them not as makers of war, but as -- of wagers -- but as wagers of peace.


 
Let me make one final point about the use of force. Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war, we must also think clearly about how we fight it. The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant -- the founder of the Red Cross, and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions.

Where force is necessary, we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct. And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules, I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war. That is what makes us different from those whom we fight. That is a source of our strength. That is why I prohibited torture. That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed. And that is why I have reaffirmed America's commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions. We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend. And we honor -- we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it's easy, but when it is hard.

I've spoken at some length to the question that must weigh on our minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war. But let me now turn to our effort to avoid such tragic choices, and speak of three ways that we can build a just and lasting peace.

First, in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws, I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior. For if we want a lasting peace, then the words of the international community must mean something. Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable. Sanctions must exact a real price.  Intransigence must be met with increased pressure -- and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one.
 
One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to seek a world without them. In the middle of the last century, nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear: All will have access to peaceful nuclear power; those without nuclear weapons will forsake them; and those with nuclear weapons will work towards disarmament. I am committed to upholding this treaty. It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy. And I'm working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russia's nuclear stockpiles.
 
But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system. Those who claim to respect international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted. Those who care for their own security cannot ignore the danger of an arms race in the Middle East or East Asia. Those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war.

The same principle applies to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own people. When there is genocide in Darfur, systematic rape in Congo, repression in Burma -- there must be consequences. Yes, there will be engagement. Yes, there will be diplomacy. But there must be consequences when those things fail. And the closer we stand together, the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression.
 
This brings me to a second point: the nature of the peace that we seek. For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict. Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting. It was this insight that drove drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after the Second World War. In the wake of devastation, they recognized that if human rights are not protected, peace is a hollow promise.

And yet, too often these words are ignored. For some countries, the failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that these are somehow Western principles, foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation's development. And within America, there's long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists -- a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world.
 
I reject these choices. I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please; choose their own leaders or assemble without fear.  Pent-up grievances fester, and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence. We also know that the opposite is true. Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace. America has never fought a war against a democracy, and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens. No matter how callously defined, neither America's interests -- nor the world's -- are served by the denial of human aspirations.

So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries, America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal. We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like Aung Sang Suu Kyi, to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings, to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran. It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation. And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear that these movements -- these movements of hope and history -- they have us on their side.
 
Let me also say this: The promotion of human rights cannot be about exhortation alone. At times, it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy. I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation. But I also know that sanctions without outreach -- condemnation without discussion -- can carry forward only a crippling status quo. No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door.
 
In light of the Cultural Revolution's horrors, Nixon's meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable -- and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies. Pope John Paul's engagement with Poland created space not just for the Catholic Church, but for labor leaders like Lech Walesa. Ronald Reagan's efforts on arms control and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet Union, but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe. There's no simple formula here.  But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement, pressure and incentives, so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time.
 
Third, a just peace includes not only civil and political rights -- it must encompass economic security and opportunity. For true -- true peace is not just freedom from fear, but freedom from want. It is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without security; it is also true that security does not exist where human beings do not have access to enough food, or clean water, or the medicine and shelter they need to survive. It does not exist where children can't aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a family. The absence of hope can rot a society from within.
 
And that's why helping farmers feed their own people, or nations educate their children and care for the sick, is not mere charity. It's also why the world must come together to confront climate change. There is little scientific dispute that if we do nothing, we will face more drought, more famine, more mass displacement -- all of which will fuel more conflict for decades. For this reason, it is not merely scientists and environmental activists who call for swift and forceful action. It's military leaders in my own country and others who understand our common security hangs in the balance.
 
Agreements among nations. Strong institutions. Support for human rights. Investments in development. All these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about. And yet, I do not believe that we will have the will, the determination, the staying power, to complete this work without something more; and that's the continued expansion of our moral imagination -- an insistence that there's something irreducible that we all share.
 
As the world grows smaller, you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are -- to understand that we're all basically seeking the same things, that we all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families.
 
And yet, somehow, given the dizzying pace of globalization, the cultural leveling of modernity, it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities -- their -- their race, their tribe, and perhaps most powerfully their religion. In some places, this fear has led to conflict. At times, it even feels like we're moving backwards. We see it in the Middle East, as the conflict between Arabs and Jews seems to harden. We see it in nations that are torn asunder by tribal lines.

And most dangerously, we see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam, and who attacked my country from Afghanistan. These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of God. The cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded. But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war. For if you truly believe that you are carrying out divine will, then there is no need for restraint -- no need to spare the pregnant mother, or the medic, or the Red Cross worker, or even a person of one own's [sic] faith.

Such a warped view of religion is not just incompatible with the concept of peace, but I believe it's incompatible with the very purpose of faith: For the one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Adhering to this law of love has always been the core struggle of human nature. For we are fallible. We make mistakes, and fall victim to the temptations of pride, and power, and sometimes evil. Even those of us with the best of intentions will at time[s] fail to right the wrongs before us.

But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected. We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place. The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance, but the love that they preached -- their fundamental faith in human progress -- that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey.
 
For if we lose that faith -- if we dismiss it as silly or naÃ¯ve; if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace -- then we lose what's best about humanity. We lose our sense of possibility. We lose our moral compass.
 
Like generations have before us, we must reject that future. As Dr. King said at this occasion so many years ago, ""I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history. I refuse to accept the idea that the 'isness' of man's present condition makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal 'oughtness' that forever confronts him."" Let us reach for the world that ought to be -- that spark of the divine that still st[i]rs within each of our souls.

Somewhere today, in the here and now, in the world as it is, a soldier sees he's outgunned, but stands firm to keep the peace. Somewhere today, in this world, a young protestor awaits the brutality of her government, but has the courage to march on. Somewhere today, a mother facing punishing poverty still takes the time to teach her child, scrapes together what few coins she has to send that child to school -- because she believes that a cruel world still has a place for that child's dreams.

Let us live by their example. We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us, and still strive for justice. We can admit the intractability of depravation, and still strive for dignity. Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace. We can do that -- for that is the story of human progress; that's the hope of all the world; and at this moment of challenge, that must be our work here on Earth.

Thank you very much.
","The Nobel committee provoked surprise, delight, and indignation around the globe Friday by awarding its Peace Prize to President Barack Obama -- with the recipient himself calling it less a recognition of his accomplishments than a ""call to action.""

The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited the 48-year-old president's creation of a ""new climate in international politics"" and his work on nuclear disarmament. ""His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world's population,"" the committee said.

The award to Mr. Obama just 37 weeks into his presidency stunned much of official Washington, and drew a range of reactions world-wide. ""So soon? Too early,"" said former Polish President Lech Walesa, who won the peace prize in 1983. ""He has no contribution so far. He is only beginning to act.""

Said John Bolton, who served as ambassador to the United Nations under former President George W. Bush: ""It is indicative of the politicization of the Nobel Peace Prize process. This just carries it to the n-th degree.""

Supporters said the award affirmed the vision the president brought to office, one that is popular overseas. Former President Jimmy Carter, who won the 2002 Peace Prize, called it ""a bold statement of international support for his vision and commitment.""

The prize also inspired heated debate about whether it would give Mr. Obama a boost at a difficult political moment or be a liability for a president whom opponents have criticized for having more ""star power"" than substance. At home, the administration is grappling with challenges ranging from high unemployment to a soaring federal deficit, while public support for the president has dropped to nearly 50% in polls. Abroad, the White House is rethinking its military strategy in Afghanistan, including the prospect of a big troop increase, while trying to build support for action to stem Iran's nuclear program.

Obama aides said the White House had no time to discuss the ramifications of the prize, good or bad, or how it might alter his presidency or his standing. ""There wasn't a lot of time to contemplate the magnitude of this,"" said senior White House adviser David Axelrod. Mr. Axelrod said he knew nothing of the president's candidacy; it wasn't clear Friday who had nominated him.

Speaking in the Rose Garden, Mr. Obama said he was ""deeply humbled"" and didn't feel he deserved to be among ""so many of the transformative figures who've been honored"" by the prize. But he would accept the prize, he said, ""as an affirmation of American leadership.""

White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, who called Mr. Obama at around 6 a.m. to break the news, said the president never considered declining the award, as some critics -- on the left and the right -- began suggesting he do almost immediately.

White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said Mr. Obama had nothing to fear from raised expectations or possible attacks from critics that the prize outstrips his accomplishments, ""because this is associated with the content of his work.""

The commitee's decision made Mr. Obama the third sitting U.S. president to win the prize, after Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. It came 45 years after the prize went to Martin Luther King Jr., the last African-American to win.

The committee that chose President Obama is comprised of five Norwegians, mostly former lawmakers and politicians, who are elected to six-year terms by Norway's parliament. The committee received 205 nominations for the peace prize this year, more than ever before.

All nominations had to be submitted by Feb. 1, just 12 days after the president took office. Members of the committee selected him after holding seven meetings and eliminating nominated candidates at each one.

Agot Valle, a Norwegian politician and member of the committee, said in a phone interview that the choice of Mr. Obama was primarily related to his stance on nuclear disarmament. Ms. Valle said the committee last met on Oct. 5, and that the decision to choose him was unanimous. She said his recent work at the United Nations in late September to pass a resolution calling for a strengthened Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty helped his candidacy.

""There is a criticism about the war in Afghanistan, and I understand that,"" said Ms. Valle. ""But this was primarily an award on his work on, and commitment to, nuclear disarmament -- and his dialogue. Of course there will be criticism, because he hasn't achieved his goals yet. It will take time, but this is a support.""

It is possible Mr. Obama was nominated by the committee itself, or at least its Social Democrat members. The committee accepts nominations from former peace prize winners; current and former members; members of national governments and parliaments; professors of law, theology, social sciences, history and philosophy; leaders of peace research and foreign affairs institutes; and members of international courts of law.

Committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland has been an enthusiastic Obama supporter in Norway. He was recently elected to the post of Secretary General of the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human-rights watchdog, and would like the Nobel committee to play a more political role.

In the handicapping before the announcement, there was no clear favorite, though Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai was seen as a potentially strong candidate. Other names included the Vietnamese Buddhist monk and democracy advocate Thich Quang Do.

Mr. Obama's win includes a cash award equal to $1.4 million. The White House said he plans to give the money to charity.
","PARIS The choice of Barack Obama on Friday as the recipient of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, less than nine months into his eventful presidency, was an unexpected honor that elicited praise and puzzlement around the globe.

Normally the prize has been presented, even controversially, for accomplishment. This prize, to a 48-year-old freshman president, for âextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,â seemed a kind of prayer and encouragement by the Nobel committee for future endeavor and more consensual American leadership.

But the prize quickly loomed as a potential political liability perhaps more burden than glory for Mr. Obama. Republicans contended that he had won more for his star power and oratorical skills than for his actual achievements, and even some Democrats privately questioned whether he deserved it.

The Nobel committeeâs embrace of Mr. Obama was viewed as a rejection of the unpopular tenure, in Europe especially, of his predecessor, George W. Bush.

But the committee, based in Norway, stressed that it made its decision based on Mr. Obamaâs actual efforts toward nuclear disarmament as well as American engagement with the world relying more on diplomacy and dialogue.

âThe question we have to ask is who has done the most in the previous year to enhance peace in the world,â the Nobel committee chairman, Thorbjorn Jagland, said in Oslo after the announcement. âAnd who has done more than Barack Obama?â

Still, Mr. Obama, who was described as âvery surprisedâ when he received the news, said he himself was not quite convinced, adding that the award âdeeply humbledâ him.

âTo be honest,â the president said in the Rose Garden, âI do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who have been honored by this prize, men and women whoâve inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace.â

He said, though, that he would âaccept this award as a call to action, a call for all nations to confront the challenges of the 21st century.â Mr. Obama plans to travel to Oslo to accept the award on Dec. 10. He will donate the prize money of $1.4 million to charity, the White House said.

Mr. Obama, only the third sitting American president to win the award, is suddenly put in the company of world leaders like Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who won for helping end the cold war, and Nelson Mandela, who sought an end to apartheid.

But less prominent figures have also won the award.

The reaction inside the administration was one of restraint, perhaps reflecting the awkwardness of winning a major prize amid a worldwide debate about whether it was deserved.

Republicans in Washington, reacting in disbelief, sought to portray Mr. Obama as unworthy. In an official statement, Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said, âThe real question Americans are asking is, âWhat has President Obama actually accomplished?â â

But there was much praise as well, even if Mr. Obamaâs allies worried that the prize might be a liability and even if much of the praise came from Europe, giving ammunition to conservatives who say Mr. Obama cares too much about opinion there.

President Nicolas Sarkozy of France said the award marked âAmericaâs return to the hearts of the worldâs peoples,â while Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said it was an âincentive to the president and to us allâ to do more for peace.

âIn a short time he has been able to set a new tone throughout the world and to create a readiness for dialogue,â she said.

For a world that at times felt pushed around by a more unilateralist Bush administration, the prize for Mr. Obama seemed wrapped in gratitude for his willingness to listen and negotiate, as well as for his positions on climate change and nuclear disarmament.

Last yearâs laureate, former President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, saw the award as an endorsement of Mr. Obamaâs goal of achieving Middle East peace.

âOf course, this puts pressure on Obama,â he said. âThe world expects that he will also achieve something.â

The prize, announced as official Washington including the president was asleep, caught the White House off guard.

The first word of it came in the form of an e-mail message to the White House staff from the White House Situation Room, which monitors events worldwide around the clock, at 5:09 a.m. It carried the subject line âitem of interest.â

Shortly before 6 a.m., the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, telephoned Mr. Obama, awakening him to share the news.

âThere has been no discussion, nothing at all,â said the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel.

The award comes at a time of considerable challenges for the president, with few sweeping achievements so far.

On the domestic front, he is pressing Congress to overhaul the nationâs health care system. In foreign affairs, he is wrestling with his advisers over how to chart a new course in Afghanistan and has been working, with little movement, to restart peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.

The Rose Garden appearance was an example of Mr. Obamaâs heavy workload; it was squeezed into a day that already included his regular intelligence and economic briefings, a private meeting with a senator, lunch with the vice president, a major speech outlining plans for a new consumer protection agency and a strategy session on Afghanistan with his national security team.

Announcing the award, the Nobel committee cited Mr. Obama âfor his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoplesâ and said that he had âcreated a new climate in international politics.â

In a four-paragraph statement, it praised Mr. Obama for his tone, his preference for negotiation and multilateral diplomacy and his vision of a cooperative world of shared values, shorn of nuclear weapons.

âOnly very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the worldâs attention and given its people hope for a better future,â the committee said. âHis diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the worldâs population.â

The other sitting American presidents to be given the award were Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, for negotiating an end to a war between Russia and Japan, and Woodrow Wilson in 1919, for the Treaty of Versailles.

Former President Jimmy Carter won in 2002 for his efforts over decades to spread peace and development. Mr. Carter called the award to Mr. Obama âa bold statement of international support for his vision and commitment.â

Former Vice President Al Gore won in 2007, sharing the prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for his work on climate change. Mr. Gore called Mr. Obamaâs award âwell deservedâ on Friday.

Mr. Obama has generated considerable goodwill overseas, with polls showing him hugely popular, and he has made a series of speeches with arching ambition. He has vowed to pursue a world without nuclear weapons; reached out to the Muslim world, delivering a major speech in Cairo in June; and sought to restart peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, at the expense of offending some of his Jewish supporters.

But he has had to devote a great deal of his time to the economic crisis and other domestic issues, and many of his policy efforts are only beginning.

In addition to the challenges in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the situation in Iraq is extremely fragile; North Korea has staged missile tests; Iran continues to enrich uranium in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions, though it recently agreed to restart nuclear talks; Israel has resisted a settlement freeze; and Saudi Arabia has refused to make new gestures toward the Israelis.

Ahmed Youssef, a Hamas spokesman, congratulated Mr. Obama but said the prize was based only on good intentions. Muhammad al-Sharif, a politically independent Gazan, was incredulous. âHas Israel stopped building the settlements?â he asked. âHas Obama achieved a Palestinian state yet?â

The Nobel committee did not tell Mr. Obama in advance of the announcement, said its chairman, Mr. Jagland. âWaking up a president in the middle of the night,â he said, âthis isnât really something you do.â

12,12,2009-11-05-FortHoodShooting.txt,"To the Fort Hood community; to Admiral Mullen, General Casey, General Cone, Secretary McHugh, Secretary Gates; most importantly, to family, friends, and members of our Armed Forces: We come together filled with sorrow for the 13 Americans that we have lost, with gratitude for the lives that they led, and with a determination to honor them through the work we carry on.

This is a time of war, yet these Americans did not die on a foreign field of battle. They were killed here, on American soil, in the heart of this great State and the heart of this great American community. This is the fact that makes the tragedy even more painful, even more incomprehensible.

For those families who have lost a loved one, no words can fill the void that's been left. We knew these men and women as soldiers and caregivers. You knew them as mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, sisters and brothers.

But here is what you must also know: Your loved ones endure through the life of our Nation. Their memory will be honored in the places they lived and by the people they touched. Their life's work is our security and the freedom that we all too often take for granted. Every evening that the sun sets on a tranquil town; every dawn that a flag is unfurled; every moment that an American enjoys life, liberty, and the pursuit of happinessâthat is their legacy. Neither this country, nor the values upon which we were founded, could exist without men and women like these 13 Americans. And that is why we must pay tribute to their stories.

Chief Warrant Officer Michael Cahill had served in the National Guard and worked as a physician's assistant for decades. A husband and father of three, he was so committed to his patients that on the day he died, he was back at work just weeks after having had a heart attack.

Major Libardo Eduardo Caraveo spoke little English when he came to America as a teenager. But he put himself through college, earned a Ph.D., and was helping combat units cope with the stress of deployment. He's survived by his wife, sons, and step-daughters.

Staff Sergeant Justin DeCrow joined the Army right after high school, married his high school sweetheart, and had served as a light wheeled mechanic and satellite communications operator. He was known as an optimist, a mentor, and a loving husband and father.

After retiring from the Army as a major, John Gaffaney cared for society's most vulnerable during two decades as a psychiatric nurse. He spent 3 years trying to return to active duty in this time of war, and he was preparing to deploy to Iraq as a captain. He leaves behind a wife and son.

Specialist Frederick Greene was a Tennessean who wanted to join the Army for a long time, and did so in 2008, with the support of his family. As a combat engineer, he was a natural leader, and he is survived by his wife and two daughters.

Specialist Jason Hunt was also recently married, with three children to care for. He joined the Army after high school and did a tour in Iraq. And it was there that he reenlisted for six more years on his 21st birthday so that he could continue to serve.

Staff Sergeant Amy Krueger was an athlete in high school and joined the Army shortly after 9/11 and had since returned home to speak to students about her experience. When her mother told her she couldn't take on Usama bin Laden by herself, Amy replied, ""Watch me.""

Private First Class Aaron Nemelka was an Eagle Scout who just recently signed up to do one of the most dangerous jobs in the service, diffuse bombs, so that he could help save lives. He was proudly carrying on a tradition of military service that runs deep within his family.

Private First Class Michael Pearson loved his family and loved his music, and his goal was to be a music teacher. He excelled at playing the guitar and could create songs on the spot and show others how to play. He joined the military a year ago and was preparing for his first deployment.

Captain Russell Seager worked as a nurse for the VA, helping veterans with posttraumatic stress. He had extraordinary respect for the military and signed up to serve so that he could help soldiers cope with the stress of combat and return to civilian life. He leaves behind a wife and son.

Private Francheska Velez, daughter of a father from Colombia and a Puerto Rican mother, had recently served in Korea and in Iraq and was pursuing a career in the Army. When she was killed, she was pregnant with her first child and was excited about becoming a mother.

Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman was the daughter and granddaughter of Army veterans. She was a single mom who put herself through college and graduate school and served as a nurse practitioner while raising her two daughters. She also left behind a loving husband.

Private First Class Kham Xiong came to America from Thailand as a small child. He was a husband and father who followed his brother into the military because his family had a strong history of service. He was preparing for his first deployment to Afghanistan.

These men and women came from all parts of the country. Some had long careers in the military. Some had signed up to serve in the shadow of 9/11. Some had known intense combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and some cared for those who did. Their lives speak to the strength, the dignity, the decency of those who serve, and that's how they will be remembered.

For that same spirit is embodied in the community here at Fort Hood and in the many wounded who are still recovering. As was already mentioned, in those terrible minutes during the attack, soldiers made makeshift tourniquets out of their clothes. They braved gunfire to reach the wounded and ferried them back to safety in the backs of cars and a pickup truck.

One young soldier, Amber Bahr, was so intent on helping others, she did not realize for some time that she herself had been shot in the back. Two police officers, Mark Todd and Kim Munley, saved countless lives by risking their own. One medic, Francisco de la Serna, treated both Officer Munley and the gunman who shot her.

It may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy. But this much we do know: No faith justifies these murderous and craven acts; no just and loving God looks upon them with favor. For what he has done, we know that the killer will be met with justice in this world and the next.

These are trying times for our country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the same extremists who killed nearly 3,000 Americans continue to endanger America, our allies, and innocent Afghans and Pakistanis. In Iraq, we're working to bring a war to a successful end, as there are still those who would deny the Iraqi people the future that Americans and Iraqis have sacrificed so much for.

As we face these challenges, the stories of those at Fort Hood reaffirm the core values that we are fighting for and the strength that we must draw upon. Theirs are the tales of American men and women answering an extraordinary call, the call to serve their comrades, their communities, and their country. In an age of selfishness, they embody responsibility. In an era of division, they call upon us to come together. In a time of cynicism, they remind us of who we are as Americans.

We are a nation that endures because of the courage of those who defend it. We saw that valor in those who braved bullets here at Fort Hood, just as surely as we see it in those who signed up knowing they would serve in harm's way.

We are a nation of laws whose commitment to justice is so enduring that we would treat a gunman and give him due process, just as surely as we will see that he pays for his crimes.

We're a nation that guarantees the freedom to worship as one chooses. And instead of claiming God for our side, we remember Lincoln's words, and always pray to be on the side of God.

We're a nation that is dedicated to the proposition that all men and women are created equal. We live that truth within our military and see it in the varied backgrounds of those we lay to rest today. We defend that truth at home and abroad, and we know that Americans will always be found on the side of liberty and equality. That's who we are as a people.

Tomorrow is Veterans Day. It's a chance to pause and to pay tribute: for students to learn the struggles that preceded them; for families to honor the service of parents and grandparents; for citizens to reflect upon the sacrifices that have been made in pursuit of a more perfect union.

For history is filled with heroes. You may remember the stories of a grandfather who marched across Europe, an uncle who fought in Vietnam, a sister who served in the gulf. But as we honor the many generations who have served, all of usâevery single Americanâmust acknowledge that this generation has more than proved itself the equal of those who've come before.

We need not look to the past for greatness, because it is before our very eyes. This generation of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen have volunteered in the time of certain danger. They are part of the finest fighting force that the world has ever known. They have served tour after tour of duty in distant, different, and difficult places. They have stood watch in blinding deserts and on snowy mountains. They have extended the opportunity of self-government to peoples that have suffered tyranny and war. They are men and women, White, Black, and Brown, of all faiths and all stations, all Americans, serving together to protect our people, while giving others half a world away the chance to lead a better life.

In today's wars, there's not always a simple ceremony that signals our troops' success, no surrender papers to be signed or capital to be claimed. But the measure of the impact of these young men and women is no less great. In a world of threats that know no borders, their legacy will be marked in the safety of our cities and towns and the security and opportunity that's extended abroad. It will serve as testimony to the character of those who served and the example that all of you in uniform set for America and for the world.

Here at Fort Hood, we pay tribute to 13 men and women who were not able to escape the horror of war, even in the comfort of home. And later today, at Fort Lewis, one community will gather to remember so many in one Stryker Brigade who have fallen in Afghanistan.

Long after they are laid to restâwhen the fighting has finished, and our Nation has endured; when today's service men and women are veterans, and their children have grownâit will be said that this generation believed under the most trying of tests; believed in perseverance, not just when it was easy, but when it was hard; that they paid the price and bore the burden to secure this Nation, and stood up for the values that live in the hearts of all free peoples.

So we say goodbye to those who now belong to eternity. We press ahead in pursuit of the peace that guided their service. May God bless the memory of those that we have lost. And may God bless the United States of America.
","A U.S. Army major allegedly opened fire Thursday on fellow troops in the heart of the giant army base here, killing 12 people and wounding at least 31 in one of the worst incidents of soldier-on-soldier violence in U.S. military history.

The shooting rampage by Maj. Malik Nadal Hasan was halted by a female civilian police officer who shot him, said Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, the top military commander on the base. The woman is expected to recover from wounds sustained in the gun battle, he said.

Maj. Hasan, 39 years old, also was hospitalized after the shooting, Lt. Gen. Cone said, and ""his death is not imminent."" Names of the victims were not released.

The alleged shooter is a psychiatrist, originally from Virginia, who had been recently promoted to major and transferred to Fort Hood from the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington. His professional specialties include post-traumatic stress disorder, combat stress and other emotional issues common to the troops implicated in earlier incidents of military fratricide.

Maj. Hasan was slated to serve for the first time in Iraq in coming weeks, military officials said. An official at the Pentagon added there were indications that Maj. Hasan was deeply upset about the pending assignment.

Maj. Hasan's cousin, Nader Hasan, told Fox News that his cousin was deeply traumatized about seeing wartime service.

""We've known for the last five years that that was probably his worst nightmare,"" Nader Hasan said. ""He would tell us how he hears horrific things . . . that was probably affecting him psychologically.""

The cousin said Maj. Hasan had joined the military out of high school against the wishes of his parents. He added that Maj. Hasan, a Muslim, hired a military lawyer and had been trying since September to avoid deployment to Iraq and leave the Army.

The shooting began about 1:30 p.m. local time in two small buildings, adjacent to a processing center where soldiers receive medical checkups as they prepare to deploy overseas, officials said.

Lt. Gen. Cone said the victims, mostly soldiers, were waiting for treatment. Soldiers at the base do not routinely carry weapons and, therefore, would have been unarmed at the time of the attack. Maj. Hasan used two handguns, he said, including a semiautomatic weapon.

The injuries of the wounded varied significantly, he said.

Quick quick action by base personnel protected about 600 people who were in a nearby theater to attend college graduation ceremonies for 138 soldiers, Lt. Gen. Cone said.

Although base officials originally said Maj. Hasan had been killed, Lt. Gen. Cone said late Thursday that the military report was mistaken, and the major was in stable condition. He had been airlifted to a hospital with four gunshot wounds; doctors were not immediately aware he was the alleged gunman, base officials said. He is not speaking with authorities and remains under guard.

With a dozen dead, Thursday's attack was one of the Army's worst single-day losses of life since the start of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

President Barack Obama said in a nationally televised address that the attack on soldiers in the U.S. was particularly unsettling.

""It's difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans in battles overseas,"" he said. ""It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil.""

Fort Hood, is the largest U.S. military facility in the world. It houses the 1st Cavalry Division and the First Army Division West, as well as an array of smaller aviation, logistics, and military police units.

More than 45,000 soldiers are assigned to the base, with many deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq at any one time. About 9,000 civilians also work at Fort Hood, and thousands of families live on the base and in nearby Killeen -- about 160 miles southwest of Dallas.

The shooting rattled service members at Fort Hood. ""It's heavy on the hearts of soldiers,"" said Dionte Turner, a 29-year-old military police officer stationed who has been deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan. Killings ""can happen anywhere,"" he said, ""but you don't expect it to happen in your backyard.""
","An Army psychiatrist facing deployment to one of Americaâs war zones killed 13 people and wounded 30 others on Thursday in a shooting rampage with two handguns at the sprawling Fort Hood Army post in central Texas, military officials said.

It was one of the worst mass shootings ever at a military base in the United States.

The gunman, who was still alive after being shot four times, was identified by law enforcement authorities as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, 39, who had been in the service since 1995. Major Hasan was about to be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas.

Clad in a military uniform and firing an automatic pistol and another weapon, Major Hasan, a balding, chubby-faced man with heavy eyebrows, sprayed bullets inside a crowded medical processing center for soldiers returning from or about to be sent overseas, military officials said.

The victims, nearly all military personnel but including two civilians, were cut down in clusters, the officials said. Witnesses told military investigators that medics working at the center tore open the clothing of the dead and wounded to get at the wounds and administer first aid.

As the shooting unfolded, military police and civilian officers of the Department of the Army responded and returned the gunmanâs fire, officials said, adding that Major Hasan was shot by a first-responder, who was herself wounded in the exchange.

In the confusion of a day of wild and misleading reports, the major and the officer who shot him were both reported killed in the gun battle, but both reports were erroneous.

Eight hours after the shootings, Lt. Gen. Robert W. Cone, a base spokesmen, said Major Hasan, whom he described as the sole gunman, had been shot four times, but was hospitalized off the base, under around-the-clock guard, in stable condition and was not in imminent danger of dying.

Another military spokesman listed the majorâs condition as critical. The condition of the officer who shot the gunman was not given.

Major Hasan was not speaking to investigators, and much about his background and his motives were unknown.

General Cone said that terrorism was not being ruled out, but that preliminary evidence did not suggest that the rampage had been an act of terrorism. Fox News quoted a retired Army colonel, Terry Lee, as saying that Major Hasan, with whom he worked, had voiced hope that President Obama would pull American troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan, had argued with military colleagues who supported the wars and had tried to prevent his own deployment.

As a parade of ambulances wailed to the scene of the shootings, officials said the extent of injuries to the wounded varied significantly, with some in critical condition and others lightly wounded. General Cone praised the first-responders and the medics who acted quickly to administer first aid at the scene.

âHorrible as this was, I think it could have been much worse,â the general said.

The rampage recalled other mass shootings in the United States, including 13 killed at a center for immigrants in upstate New York last April, the deaths of 10 during a gunmanâs rampage in Alabama in March and 32 people killed at Virginia Tech in 2007, the deadliest shooting in modern American history.

As a widespread investigation by the military, the F.B.I., and other agencies began, much about the assault in Texas remained unclear. Department of Homeland Security officials said the Army would take the lead in the investigation.

A federal law enforcement official said the F.B.I. was sending more agents to join the inquiry. On Thursday night, F.B.I. agents were interviewing residents of a townhouse complex in the Washington suburb of Kensington, Md., where Major Hasan had lived before moving to Texas.

Mr. Obama called the shootings âa horrific outburst of violenceâ and urged Americans to pray for those who were killed and wounded.

âIt is difficult enough when we lose these men and women in battles overseas,â he said. âIt is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil.â

The president pledged âto get answers to every single question about this horrible incident.â

Military records indicated that Major Hasan was single, had been born in Virginia, had never served abroad and listed âno religious preferenceâ on his personnel records. Three other soldiers, their roles unclear, were taken into custody in connection with the rampage. The office of Representative John Carter, Republican of Texas, said they were later released, but a Fort Hood spokesman could not confirm that. General Cone said that more than 100 people had been questioned during the day.

Fort Hood, near Killeen and 100 miles south of Dallas-Fort Worth, is the largest active duty military post in the United States, 340 square miles of training and support facilities and homes, a virtual city for more than 50,000 military personnel and some 150,000 family members and civilian support personnel. It has been a major center for troops being deployed to or returning from service in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The base went into lockdown shortly after the shootings. Gates were closed and barriers put up at all entrance and exit checkpoints, and the military police turned away all but essential personnel. Schools on the base were closed, playgrounds were deserted and sidewalks were empty. Sirens wailed across the base through the afternoon, a warning to military personnel and their families to remain indoors.

Military commanders were instructed to account for all personnel on the base.

âThe immediate concern is to make sure that all of our soldiers and family members are safe, and thatâs what commanders have been instructed to do,â said Jay Adams of the First Army, Division West, at Ford Hood.

General Cone said the shooting took place about 1:30 p.m., inside a complex of buildings that he called a Soldier Readiness Processing Center. The type of weapons used was unclear, and it was not known whether the gunman had reloaded, although it seemed likely, given that 43 people were shot, perhaps more than once.

All the victims were gunned down âin the same area,â General Cone said.

As the shootings ended, scores of emergency vehicles rushed to the scene, which is in the center of the fort, and dozens of ambulances carried the shooting victims to hospitals in the region.

Both of the handguns used by Major Hasan were recovered at the scene, officials said. Investigators said the majorâs computers, cellphones and papers would be examined, his past investigated and his friends, relatives and military acquaintances would be interviewed in an effort to develop a profile of him and try to learn what had motivated his deadly outburst.

Major Hasan was assigned to the Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood.

The weapons used in the attack were described as âcivilianâ handguns. Security experts said the fact that two handguns had been used suggested premeditation, as opposed to a spontaneous act.

Rifles and assault weapons are conspicuous and not ordinarily seen on the streets of a military post, and medical personnel would have no reason to carry any weapon, they said. Moreover, security experts noted, it took a lot of ammunition to shoot 43 people, another indication of premeditation.

It appeared certain that the shootings would generate a whole new look at questions of security on military posts of all the armed forces in the United States. Expressions of dismay were voiced by public officials across the country.

The Muslim Public Affairs Council, speaking for many American Muslims, condemned the shootings as a âheinous incidentâ and said, âWe share the sentiment of our president.â

The council added, âOur entire organization extends its heartfelt condolences to the families of those killed as well as those wounded and their loved ones.â

General Cone said Fort Hood was âabsolutely devastated.â

News of the shooting set off panic among families and friends of the base personnel. Alyssa Marie Seaceâs husband, Pfc. Ray Seace Jr., sent her a text message just before 2 p.m. saying that someone had âshot up the S.R.P. building,â referring to the Soldier Readiness Processing Center. He told her he was âhiding.â

Ms. Seace, 18, who lives about five minutes from the base and had not been watching the news, reacted with alarm. She texted him back but got no response. She called her father in Connecticut, who told her not to call her husband because it might reveal his hiding place.

Finally, 45 minutes later, her husband, a mechanic who is scheduled to deploy to Iraq in February, texted back to say that three people from his unit had been hit and that a dozen people in all were dead.

By late afternoon, the sirens at Fort Hood had fallen silent. In Killeen, state troopers were parked on ridges overlooking the two main highways through town. In residential areas, the only signs of life were cars moving through the streets. In the business districts, people went about their business.

In 1991, Killeen was the scene of one of the worst mass killings in American history. A gunman drove his pickup truck through the window of a cafeteria, fatally shot 22 people with a handgun, then killed himself.

Fort Hood, opened in September 1942 as America geared up for World War II, was named for Gen. John Bell Hood of the Confederacy. It has been used continuously for armor training and is charged with maintaining readiness for combat missions.

It is a place that feels, on ordinary days, like one of the safest in the world, surrounded by those who protect the nation with their lives. It is home to nine schools seven elementary schools and two middle schools, for the children of personnel. But on Thursday, the streets were lined with emergency vehicles, their lights flashing and sirens piercing the air as Texas Rangers and state troopers took up posts at the gates to seal the base.

Shortly after 7 p.m., the sirens sounded again and over the loudspeakers a womanâs voice that could be heard all over the base announced in a clipped military fashion: âDeclared emergency no longer exists.â

The gates reopened, and a stream of cars and trucks that had been bottled up for hours began to move out.

13,13,2009-12-19-CopenhagenClimateConf.txt,"Good morning. It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nations around the world. We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave and growing danger to our people. All of you would not be here unless you -- like me -- were convinced that this danger is real. This is not fiction, it is science. Unchecked, climate change will pose unacceptable risks to our security, our economies, and our planet. This much we know.

The question, then, before us is no longer the nature of the challenge. The question is our capacity to meet it. For while the reality of climate change is not in doubt, I have to be honest, as the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt right now, and it hangs in the balance.

I believe we can act boldly, and decisively, in the face of a common threat. That's why I come here today -- not to talk, but to act.

Now, as the world's largest economy and as the world's second largest emitter, America bears our responsibility to address climate change, and we intend to meet that responsibility. That's why we've renewed our leadership within international climate change negotiations. That's why we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. That's why we've taken bold action at home -- by making historic investments in renewable energy; by putting our people to work increasing efficiency in our homes and buildings; and by pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform to a clean energy economy.

These mitigation actions are ambitious, and we are taking them not simply to meet global responsibilities. We are convinced, as some of you may be convinced, that changing the way we produce and use energy is essential to America's economic future -- that it will create millions of new jobs, power new industries, keep us competitive, and spark new innovation. We're convinced, for our own self-interest, that the way we use energy, changing it to a more efficient fashion, is essential to our national security, because it helps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and helps us deal with some of the dangers posed by climate change.

So I want this plenary session to understand, America is going to continue on this course of action to mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy economy, no matter what happens here in Copenhagen. We think it is good for us, as well as good for the world. But we also believe that we will all be stronger, all be safer, all be more secure if we act together. That's why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agree to certain steps, and to hold each other accountable to certain commitments.

After months of talk, after two weeks of negotiations, after innumerable side meetings, bilateral meetings, endless hours of discussion among negotiators, I believe that the pieces of that accord should now be clear.

First, all major economies must put forward decisive national actions that will reduce their emissions, and begin to turn the corner on climate change. I'm pleased that many of us have already done so. Almost all the major economies have put forward legitimate targets, significant targets, ambitious targets. And I'm confident that America will fulfill the commitments that we have made: cutting our emissions in the range of 17 percent by 2020, and by more than 80 percent by 2050 in line with final legislation.

Second, we must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments, and exchange this information in a transparent manner. These measures need not be intrusive, or infringe upon sovereignty. They must, however, ensure that an accord is credible, and that we're living up to our obligations. Without such accountability, any agreement would be empty words on a page.

I don't know how you have an international agreement where we all are not sharing information and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments. That doesn't make sense. It would be a hollow victory.

Number three, we must have financing that helps developing countries adapt, particularly the least developed and most vulnerable countries to climate change. America will be a part of fast-start funding that will ramp up to $10 billion by 2012. And yesterday, Secretary Hillary Clinton, my Secretary of State, made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize $100 billion in financing by 2020, if -- and only if -- it is part of a broader accord that I have just described.

Mitigation. Transparency. Financing. It's a clear formula -- one that embraces the principle of common but differentiated responses and respective capabilities. And it adds up to a significant accord -- one that takes us farther than we have ever gone before as an international community.

I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time. And at this point, the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart, whether we prefer posturing to action. I'm sure that many consider this an imperfect framework that I just described. No country will get everything that it wants. There are those developing countries that want aid with no strings attached, and no obligations with respect to transparency. They think that the most advanced nations should pay a higher price. I understand that. There are those advanced nations who think that developing countries either cannot absorb this assistance, or that will not be held accountable effectively, and that the world's fastest-growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden.

We know the fault lines because we've been imprisoned by them for years. These international discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades, and we have very little to show for it other than an increased acceleration of the climate change phenomenon. The time for talk is over. This is the bottom line: We can embrace this accord, take a substantial step forward, continue to refine it and build upon its foundation. We can do that, and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic endeavor -- one that makes life better for our children and our grandchildren.

Or we can choose delay, falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way of action for years. And we will be back having the same stale arguments month after month, year after year, perhaps decade after decade, all while the danger of climate change grows until it is irreversible.

Ladies and gentlemen, there is no time to waste. America has made our choice. We have charted our course. We have made our commitments. We will do what we say. Now I believe it's the time for the nations and the people of the world to come together behind a common purpose.

We are ready to get this done today -- but there has to be movement on all sides to recognize that it is better for us to act than to talk; itâs better for us to choose action over inaction; the future over the past -- and with courage and faith, I believe that we can meet our responsibility to our people, and the future of our planet.

Thank you very much.
","President Obama announced here on Friday night that five major nations, including the United States, had together forged a climate deal. He called it ""an unprecedented breakthrough"" but acknowledged that it still fell short of what was required to combat global warming.

The agreement addresses many of the issues that leaders came here to settle. But it has left many of the participants in the climate talks unhappy, from the Europeans, who now have the only binding carbon control regime in the world, to the delegates from the poorest nations, who objected to being left out of the critical negotiations.

By the early hours of Saturday, representatives of the 193 countries who have negotiated here for nearly two weeks had not yet approved the deal and there were signs they might not. But Mr. Obama, who left before the conference considered the accord because of a major storm descending on Washington, noted that the agreement was merely a political statement and not a legally binding treaty and might not need ratification by the entire conference.

The three-page accord that Mr. Obama negotiated with the leaders of China, India, Brazil and South Africa and then presented to the conference did not meet even the modest expectations that leaders set for this meeting, notably by failing to set a 2010 goal for reaching a binding international treaty to seal the provisions of the accord.

Nor does the plan firmly commit the industrialized nations or the developing nations to firm targets for midterm or long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The accord is nonetheless significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming.

""For the first time in history,"" Mr. Obama said, ""all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change.""

The accord provides a system for monitoring and reporting progress toward those national pollution-reduction goals, a compromise on an issue over which China bargained hard. It calls for hundreds of billions of dollars to flow from wealthy nations to those countries most vulnerable to a changing climate. And it sets a goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2050, implying deep cuts in climate-altering emissions over the next four decades.

But it was an equivocal agreement that was, to many, a disappointing conclusion to a two-year process that had the goal of producing a comprehensive and enforceable action plan for addressing dangerous changes to the global climate. The messy compromise mirrored the chaotic nature of the conference, which virtually all participants said had been badly organized and run.

In a news conference, Mr. Obama said the accord was only a tentative start down a long road.

""This progress did not come easily,"" he said, ""and we know that this progress alone is not enough.""

The accord sets no goal for concluding a binding international treaty, which leaves the implementation of its provisions uncertain. It is likely to undergo many months, perhaps years, of additional negotiations before it emerges in any internationally enforceable form.

Mr. Obama said before he left Copenhagen that he was confident that a final accord would be reached here. He looked weary and his eyes were bloodshot as he left the conference center for his motorcade to the airport.

Some environmental groups gave a cautious nod of approval to the agreement as a good start.

""The world's nations have come together and concluded a historic -- if incomplete -- agreement to begin tackling global warming,"" said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. ""Tonight's announcement is but a first step and much work remains to be done in the days and months ahead in order to seal a final international climate deal that is fair, binding and ambitious. It is imperative that negotiations resume as soon as possible.""

Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and lead author of the Senate's climate change bill, said the accord would drive the Congress to pass climate change legislation early next year.

""This can be a catalyzing moment,"" he said. ""President Obama's hands-on engagement broke through the bickering and sets the stage for a final deal and for Senate passage this spring of major legislation at home.""

But there were serious rumblings of discontent that could yet scuttle the deal.

Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, a Sudanese diplomat who has been representing the Group of 77 developing countries, denounced the accord.

""The developed countries have decided that damage to developing countries is acceptable,"" he told reporters, saying that the 2-degree target would ""result in massive devastation to Africa and small island states."" He and many other representatives of the most vulnerable countries wanted a target of 1.5 degrees.

""Today's events, which really are a continuation of the history of the negotiations for the last two years, represent the worst development in climate change negotiations in history,"" Mr. Di-Aping said.

Mr. Obama's announcement came late in a day that began with his 11-minute address to world leaders shortly after noon, and that was filled with brinksmanship and 11th-hour negotiations. Mr. Obama, whose speech included remarks that appeared pointed at China's resistance to mechanisms for monitoring emissions reductions, met privately with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao afterward. But Mr. Wen did not attend two smaller, impromptu meetings during the day that Mr. Obama and United States officials conducted with the leaders of other world powers, an apparent snub that infuriated administration officials and their European counterparts.

The deal eventually came together after a dramatic moment in which Mr. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton burst into a meeting of the Chinese, Indian and Brazilian leaders, according to senior administration officials. Mr. Obama said he did not want them negotiating in secret.

The intrusion led to new talks that cemented central terms of the deal, American officials said.

Sergio Serra, Brazil's senior climate negotiator here, confirmed that Mr. Obama had joined a meeting of Brazilian, Indian, Chinese and other officials, although he did not say that Mr. Obama walked in uninvited.

""After several discussions had taken place, they were joined by President Barack Obama,"" Mr. Serra said. ""Several important decisions were taken -- not a few due to Brazilian mediation -- that we hope will bring a result, if not what we expected, that may be a way of salvaging something and pave the way to another meeting or series of meetings to get the full result of this proceeding.""

Jian Xiaoyan, a press officer with the Chinese government, said there was no one available to comment Friday night.

The agreement apparently grew out of a document that was being edited by high-ranking officials from some two dozen countries throughout the day. But many specifics that were included in earlier versions were excised in the document left on the table when Mr. Obama made his announcement, and many parties considered it at best a work in progress. The agreement contains several enumerated points asserting a general commitment to the idea that ""climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time"" and asserts that ""deep cuts"" in global emissions were required.

In at least one earlier version, the deal included a collective agreement among nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050 -- with developed nations pledging as a bloc to reduce emissions by 80 percent over the same period. Those numbers were no longer in the version circulated after Mr. Obama's announcement.

Also dropped from earlier drafts was language calling for a binding accord ""as soon as possible,"" and no later than at the next meeting of the parties, in Mexico City next November. The deal presented Friday evening said only that the agreement should be reviewed and put in place by 2015.

The document does lay out a framework for verification of emissions commitments by developing countries and for establishing a ""high-level panel"" to assess financial contributions by rich nations to help poor countries adapt to climate change and limit their emissions.

Many of the specifics remained to be negotiated, however.

Mr. Serra, the Brazilian diplomat, said that the process left many alienated, particularly the smaller countries that have little influence in a major international negotiation. Many involved in the process here suggested this would be the last time that 193 nations would gather in this way to negotiate such a complex accord.

""Certain groups like G-77 are not happy when a few people make decisions,"" Mr. Serra said. ""It's not an inclusive exercise. Perhaps it can't be.""
","Just two years ago, a United Nations panel that synthesizes the work of hundreds of climatologists around the world called the evidence for global warming âunequivocal.â

But as representatives of about 200 nations converge in Copenhagen on Monday to begin talks on a new international climate accord, they do so against a background of renewed attacks on the basic science of climate change.

The debate, set off by the circulation of several thousand files and e-mail messages stolen from one of the worldâs foremost climate research institutes, has led some who oppose limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and at least one influential country, Saudi Arabia, to question the scientific basis for the Copenhagen talks.

The uproar has threatened to complicate a multiyear diplomatic effort already ensnared in difficult political, technical and financial disputes that have caused leaders to abandon hopes of hammering out a binding international climate treaty this year.

In recent days, an array of scientists and policy makers have said that nothing so far disclosed the correspondence and documents include references by prominent climate scientists to deleting potentially embarrassing e-mail messages, keeping papers by competing scientists from publication and making adjustments in research data undercuts decades of peer-reviewed science.

Yet the intensity of the response highlights that skepticism about global warming persists, even as many scientists thought the battle over the reality of human-driven climate change was finally behind them.

On dozens of Web sites and blogs, skeptics and foes of greenhouse gas restrictions take daily aim at the scientific arguments for human-driven climate change. The stolen material was quickly seized upon for the questions it raised about the accessibility of raw data to outsiders and whether some data had been manipulated.

An investigation into the stolen files is being conducted by the University of East Anglia, in England, where the computer breach occurred. Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has also said he will look into the matter. At the same time, polls in the United States and Britain suggest that the number of people who doubt that global warming is dangerous or caused by humans has grown in recent years.

Politics, ideology and economic interests interlace the debate, and the stakes on both sides are high. If scientific predictions about global warmingâs effects are correct, inaction will lead at best to rising social, economic and environmental disruption, at worst to a calamity far more severe. If the forecasts are wrong, nations could divert hundreds of billions of dollars to curb greenhouse gas emissions at a time when they are struggling to recover from a global recession.

Yet the case for human-driven warming, many scientists say, is far clearer now than a decade ago, when the skeptics included many people who now are convinced that climate change is a real and serious threat.

Even some who remain skeptical about the extent or pace of global warming say that the premise underlying the Copenhagen talks is solid: that warming is to some extent driven by greenhouse gases spewing into the atmosphere from human activities like the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.

Roger A. Pielke Sr., for example, a climate scientist at the University of Colorado who has been highly critical of the United Nations climate panel and who once branded many of the scientists now embroiled in the e-mail controversy part of a climate âoligarchy,â said that so many independent measures existed to show unusual warming taking place that there was no real dispute about it. Moreover, he said, âThe role of added carbon dioxide as a major contributor in climate change has been firmly established.â

The Copenhagen conference itself reflects increasing acceptance of the scientific arguments: the negotiations leading to the talks were conducted by high-ranking officials of the worldâs governments rather than the scientists and environment ministers who largely shaped the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Late last week, President Obama changed the date of his visit to Copenhagen to Dec. 18, the last day of the talks.

For many, a 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was a marker of a shift in the global warming debate. In it, the panel -- a volunteer network of hundreds of scientists from many disciplines who meet periodically to review climate studies and translate the results into language useful to policy makers -- concluded that no doubt remained that the earth was warming. Recent warming was ""very likely"" driven by human actions, the report said, and if unabated, posed rising risks to people and ecosystems.

Over the last several decades, other reviews, by the National Academy of Sciences and other institutions, have largely echoed the panelâs findings and said the remaining uncertainties should not be an excuse for inaction.

The panelâs report was built on two decades of intensive scientific study of climate patterns.

Greenhouse gases warm the planet by letting in sunlight and blocking the escape of some of the resulting heat. âThe physics of the greenhouse effect is so basic that instead of asking whether it would happen, it makes more sense to ask what on earth could make it not happen,â said Spencer Weart, a physicist and historian. âSo far, nobody has been able to come up with anything plausible in that line.â

The atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases released by humans has risen rapidly in the last century, along with industrialization and electricity use. Carbon dioxide from burning of coal, oil and natural gas is the most potent of the greenhouse gases because it can persist in the atmosphere for a century or more.

Methane from landfills, livestock and leaking pipes, tanks and wells has recently been found to be a close second. And these gases not only have a heating effect, but also cause evaporation of water from sea and soil, producing water vapor, another powerful heat-trapping gas.

In reaching its conclusion, the climate panel relied only partly on temperature data like that collected by the scientists at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, whose circulated e-mail correspondence set off the current uproar. It also considered a wide range of data from other sources, including measurements showing the retreat of glaciers in mountain ranges around the world, changes in the length and character of the seasons, heating of the oceans and marked retreats of sea ice in the Arctic.

Since 1979, satellites have provided another check on surface temperature measurements. Strong disagreements about how to interpret the satellite data were largely resolved after the Bush administration began a review in which competing research groups worked out some of their differences.

Science is about probability, not certainty. And the persisting uncertainties in climate science leave room for argument. What is a realistic estimate of how much temperatures will rise? How severe will the effects be? Are there tipping points beyond which the changes are uncontrollable?

Even climate scientists disagree on many of these questions. But skeptics have been critical of the data assembled to show that warming is occurring and the analytic methods that climate scientists use, including mathematical models used to demonstrate a human cause for warming and project future trends.

Both sides also have at times been criticized for overstatement in characterizing the scientific evidence. The contents of the stolen e-mail messages and documents have given fresh ammunition to the skepticsâ camp.

The Climatic Research Unitâs role as a central aggregator of temperature and other climate data has also made it a target. One widely discussed file extracted from the unitâs computers, presumed to be the log of a researcher named Ian Harris, recorded his years of frustration in trying to make sense of disparate data and described procedures or âfudge factors,â as he called them used by scientists to eliminate known sources of error.

The research in question concerned attempts to chart past temperature changes by studying direct measurements of temperature. An influential study that drew in part on the British data was challenged in 2003. In 2006, a review by the National Academy of Sciences concluded, with some reservations, that âan array of evidenceâ supported the broad thrust of the research.

To skeptics, the purloined files suggest a conspiracy to foist an expensive policy agenda on the nations of the world and to keep inconsistent data from the public.

âIf we were arguing about archaeology then people could hoard their data,â said Stephen McIntyre, a blogger and retired Canadian mining consultant who since 2003 has investigated climate data, sometimes finding errors. âBut I donât think the public has any time for thatâ in the climate debate.

Many scientists, however, deny that any important data was held back and say that the e-mail messages and documents will in the end prove merely another manufactured controversy.

âThere will remain after the dust settles in this controversy a very strong scientific consensus on key characteristics of the problem,â John Holdren, President Obamaâs science adviser, told a Congressional hearing last week. âGlobal climate is changing in highly unusual ways compared to long experienced and expected natural variations.â

Whichever view prevails, the questions will undoubtedly linger well after the negotiators who are trying to work out the complex issues that still stand in the way of an international climate treaty leave Copenhagen.

14,14,2009-12-25-UnderwearBomber.txt,"Good morning, everybody. I want to take just a few minutes to update the American people on the attempted terrorist attack that occurred on Christmas Day and the steps we're taking to ensure the safety and security of the country.

The investigation's ongoing. And I spoke again this morning with Attorney General Eric Holder, the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, and my counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, John Brennan. I asked them to keep -- continue monitoring the situation to keep the American people and members of Congress informed.

Now, here's what we know so far: On Christmas Day, Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was en route from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit. As the plane made its final approach to Detroit Metropolitan Airport, a passenger allegedly tried to ignite an explosive device on his body, setting off a fire. Thanks to the quick and heroic actions of passengers and crew, the suspect was immediately subdued, the fire was put out, and the plane landed safely. The suspect is now in custody and has been charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft. And a full investigation has been launched into this attempted act of terrorism, and we will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable.

Now, this was a serious reminder of the dangers that we face and the nature of those who threaten our homeland. Had the suspect succeeded in bringing down that plane, it could have killed nearly 300 passengers and crew, innocent civilians preparing to celebrate the holidays with their families and friends. The American people should be assured that we are doing everything in our power to keep you and your family safe and secure during this busy holiday season.

Since I was first notified of this incident, I've ordered the following actions to be taken to protect the American people and to secure air travel.

First, I directed that we take immediate steps to ensure the safety of the traveling public. We made sure that all flights still in the air were secure and could land safely. We immediately enhanced screening and security procedures for all flights, domestic and international. We added federal air marshals to flights entering and leaving the United States. And we're working closely in this country, federal, state and local law enforcement, with our international partners.

Second, I've ordered two important reviews1,2, because it's absolutely critical that we learn from this incident and take the necessary measures to prevent future acts of terrorism.

The first review involves our watch list system, which our government has had in place for many years to identify known and suspected terrorists so that we can prevent their entry into the United States. Apparently the suspect in the Christmas incident was in this system, but not on a watch list, such as the so-called no-fly list. So I have ordered a thorough review, not only of how information related to the subject was handled, but of the overall watch list system and how it can be strengthened.

The second review will examine all screening policies, technologies, and procedures related to air travel. We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks.

Third, I've directed my national security team to keep up the pressure on those who would attack our country. We do not yet have all the answers about this latest attempt, but those who would slaughter innocent men, women, and children must know that the United States will more -- do more than simply strengthen our defenses. We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle, and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the U.S. homeland.

Finally, the American people should remain vigilant, but also be confident. Those plotting against us seek not only to undermine our security, but also the open society and the values that we cherish as Americans. This incident, like several that have preceded it, demonstrates that an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist.

As a nation, we will do everything in our power to protect our country. As Americans, we will never give in to fear or division. We will be guided by our hopes, our unity, and our deeply held values.

That's who we are as Americans.

That's what our brave men and women in uniform are standing up for as they spend the holidays in harm's way.

And we will continue to do everything that we can to keep America safe in the new year and beyond.

Before I leave, let me also briefly address the events that have taken place over the last few days in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The United States joins with the international community in strongly condemning the violent and unjust suppression of innocent Iranian citizens, which has apparently resulted in detentions, injuries, and even death.

For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universal rights. Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality, even on solemn occasions and holy days. And each time that has happened, the world has watched with deep admiration for the courage and the conviction of the Iranian people who are part of Iran's great and enduring civilization.

What's taking place within Iran is not about the United States or any other country. It's about the Iranian people and their aspirations for justice and a better life for themselves. And the decision of Iran's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not succeed in making those aspirations go away.

As I said in Oslo, it's telling when governments fear the aspirations [of] their own people more than the power of any other nation.

Along with all free nations, the United States stands with those who seek their universal rights. We call upon the Iranian government to abide by the international obligations that it has to respect the rights of its own people.

We call for the immediate release of all who have been unjustly detained within Iran.

We will continue to bear witness to the extraordinary events that are taking place there. And I'm confident that history will be on the side of those who seek justice.

Thank you very much, everybody. And happy New Year.
","A passenger on a Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines flight tried Friday to detonate an explosive device strapped to his leg and later told investigators he had affiliations with Al Qaeda and was trying to blow up the plane, according to a senior U.S. official.

""We believe this was an attempted act of terrorism,"" said a White House official.

The suspect told investigators he was given the device by al Qaeda operatives in Yemen, along with detonation instructions, the official said. ""This guy claims he is tied to al Qaeda, specifically in Yemen,"" the official said. ""He claims he was on orders from al Qaeda in Yemen. Who knows if that's true?""

Rep. Peter King (R., N.Y.) identified the man as a 23-year-old Nigerian named Abdul Mudallad. Mr. King said authorities were scrambling to find out where a security breach might have occurred. He also said there was no intelligence indicating it was part of a wider plot involving other attempted attacks, but that authorities weren't taking any chances. Mr. King later told CNN that the suspect boarded a KLM flight in Lagos, Nigeria, and connected in Amsterdam to the Northwest flight.

One U.S. intelligence official said the alleged explosive was a mix of powder and liquid. Mr. King said the concoction was strapped to Mr. Mudallad's leg.

The White House said President Barack Obama, vacationing in Hawaii, was notified of the incident after 9 a.m. local time and held two secure conference calls with his national-security team. He ordered increased security for air travel, the White House said. The Department of Homeland Security said airline passengers should expect to see additional screening measures on both domestic and international flights.

The incident aboard Northwest Flight 253, an Airbus 330-300 carrying about 278 passengers, came as the plane was approaching the airport just before noon. It landed safely after the pilots declared an emergency. Though a Northwest flight, the plane had Delta markings. After a merger, Delta Air Lines Inc. now owns Northwest.

Stephanie van Herk, a passenger from the Netherlands who was in seat 18B, said the plane had lowered its landing gear when she heard a loud bang. At first she thought the plane might have blown a tire, she said, but then she saw flame leap from the lap of a man in the row behind her in the window seat 19A. ""It was higher than the seat,"" said Ms. van Herk, 22 years old.

""Then everyone started screaming,"" she said. ""It was panic."" Flight attendants shouted ""What are you doing? What are you doing?"" They called for water, and the man began pulling down his burning pants, said Ms. van Herk. She and other passengers got water from the galley and the man was doused. Then a Dutch man jumped him.

Flight passenger Syed Jafry, a U.S. citizen who had flown from the United Arab Emirates, said he was seated three rows behind when he saw a glow and smelled smoke. He said, ""A young man behind me jumped on him.""

A woman who was seated in row 32 said she heard someone shout, ""What the hell are you trying to do, kill all of us?""

""It was scary,"" said the woman, a nurse named Michelle from Dayton, Ohio, who did not want her last name published. Her voice was still shaking hours after the incident. ""I just can't believe it.""

A few passengers applauded the man who was identified as having helped subdue the alleged attacker, Michelle said.

The explosive was at first believed to have been a small firecracker.

One passenger was taken to the University of Michigan Medical Center and remained hospitalized Friday.

Shortly after the plane landed around 11:50 a.m. Detroit time, the Transportation Security Administration said that ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the jet's passengers were put through a special security screening and luggage was re-examined. TSA and FBI officials interviewed passengers as the plane sat at a remote corner of the airport, surrounded by law-enforcement and emergency vehicles.

Regardless of what the investigation uncovers about the suspect's motives or the material that ignited, Friday's incident is likely to renew debate over whether new security systems are necessary to allow flight attendants to alert cockpit crews.

In addition to calling pilots on the intercom, airlines and security experts for years have debated the idea of providing cabin crews with additional ways to warn pilots about potential threats from passengers. Video cameras, wireless alerting devices or some type of discreet alarm switch have all been discussed as remedies.

The incident also is bound to renew debate over the effectiveness of the current system of international ""no-fly"" lists, aimed at identifying passengers with terrorist connections and keeping them off airliners around the globe.

So far, the Federal Aviation Administration and many airlines have been resisting such mandates, arguing they are expensive and unnecessary.

Delta Air Lines Inc. said it was cooperating with investigators.
","A Nigerian man tried to ignite an explosive device aboard a trans-Atlantic Northwest Airlines flight as the plane prepared to land in Detroit on Friday, in an incident the United States believes was âan attempted act of terrorism,â according to a White House official who declined to be identified.

The device, described by officials as a mixture of powder and liquid, failed to fully detonate. Passengers on the plane described a series of pops that sounded like firecrackers.

Federal officials said the man wanted to bring the plane down.

âThis was the real deal,â said Representative Peter T. King of New York, the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, who was briefed on the incident and said something had gone wrong with the explosive device, which he described as somewhat sophisticated. âThis could have been devastating,â Mr. King said.

The incident is likely to lead to heightened security during the busy holiday season.

It was unclear how the man, identified by federal officials as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, managed to get the explosive on the plane, an Airbus A330 wide-body jet carrying 278 passengers that departed from Amsterdam with passengers who had originated in Nigeria. A senior administration official said that the government did not yet know whether the man had had the capacity to take down the plane.

âWeâre trying to ascertain exactly what he had and what he thought he was doing, but our sense is he wanted to wreak some havoc here and was attempting to do just that,â the official said. âWhether at the end of the day he had the ability to do that is what I think weâll be able to pull together over the next several days as we investigate this.â

A senior Department of Homeland Security official said that the materials Mr. Abdulmutallab had on him were âmore incendiary than explosive,â and that he had tried to ignite them to cause a fire as the airliner was approaching Detroit.

Mr. Abdulmutallab told law enforcement authorities, the official said, that he had had explosive powder taped to his leg and that he had mixed it with chemicals held in a syringe.

A federal counterterrorism official who asked not to be identified said Mr. Abdulmutallab was apparently in a government law enforcement-intelligence database, but it is not clear what extremist group or individuals he might be linked to.

âItâs too early to say what his association is,â the counterterrorism official said. âAt this point, it seems like he was acting alone, but we donât know for sure.â Although Mr. Abdulmutallab is said to have told officials that he was directed by Al Qaeda, the counterterrorism official expressed caution about that claim, saying âit may have been aspirational.â

The incident unfolded just before noon. âThere was a pop that sounded like a firecracker,â said Syed Jafry, a passenger who said he had been sitting three rows ahead of the suspect. A few seconds later, he said, there was smoke and âsome glowâ from the suspectâs seat and on the left side of the plane.

âThere was a panic,â said Mr. Jafry, 57, of Holland, Ohio. âNext thing you know everybody was on him.â He said the passengers and the crew subdued the man.

The suspect was brought by the crew to the front of the plane Northwest Airlines Flight 253, bearing Deltaâs name and the plane made its descent into Detroit Metropolitan Airport, landing at 11:53 a.m. (The two airlines merged last year.) Once on the ground, it was immediately guided to the end of a runway, where it was surrounded by police cars and emergency vehicles and searched by a bomb-disabling robot.

Sandra Berchtold, a spokeswoman with the Federal Bureau of Investigationâs Detroit office, said F.B.I. agents were at the scene Friday night and were investigating the matter.

One federal official who requested anonymity said Mr. Abdulmutallab had suffered severe burns but was expected to survive. A Michigan state official confirmed that he was being treated at the University of Michigan hospital in Ann Arbor.

President Obama was kept informed throughout the day as he spent Christmas with his family and friends at a secluded Hawaiian beach house. After a secure conference call, he was given several follow-up briefings on paper. John O. Brennan, the White House counterterrorism chief, convened an interagency meeting in the late afternoon to go over what was known about the incident and discuss what precautions should be taken.

A second Department of Homeland Security official said that the Transportation Security Administration used layers of security measures at the nationâs airports and that it would be tightening them as a result of the incident in Detroit.

These measures some visible to passengers, some not include bomb-sniffing dog teams, carry-on luggage and passenger screening measures, and plainclothes behavioral-detection specialists inside airport terminals. The official said there were no immediate plans to elevate the nationâs threat level, which has been at orange since 2006.

Mr. King, of the Homeland Security Committee, said there was no indication at this point that anyone else was involved, but he said officials would look back to see if any intelligence signals were missed. âFor a while now we have had real concerns about Al Qaeda or terrorist connections in Nigeria,â he said.

Of the device used on Friday, he said, âIt appears to be different from explosive devices that have been used before. That is perhaps why it escaped detection. Maybe that is why it made it through.â

Questions have been raised for years about aviation security in Nigeria. Last month, however, the T.S.A. said that standards at the Lagos airport met international criteria for security.

Fridayâs incident brought to mind Richard C. Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, who attempted to blow up an American Airlines flight between Paris and Miami in December 2001 by igniting explosives in his shoes. Mr. Reid was subdued by a flight attendant and passengers and the plane landed safely in Boston. Mr. Reid later pleaded guilty to three terrorism-related counts and was sentenced to life in prison. Since then, airline passengers have had to remove their shoes before passing through security checkpoints in American airports.

In August 2006, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up planes bound for the United States using explosives that would be mixed with liquids on board. Eight men were arrested, and three were convicted in the case this fall. British authorities estimated that as many as 2,000 airplane passengers might have been killed had the plotters been successful. The plot led security officials to limit the amount of liquids and gels that passengers can bring on board in their carry-on baggage.

15,15,2010-01-12-HaitiEarthquake.txt,"Good morning, everybody. I've directed my administration to launch a swift, coordinated, and aggressive effort to save lives and support the recovery in Haiti. The losses that have been suffered in Haiti are nothing less than devastating, and responding to a disaster of this magnitude will require every element of our national capacity: our diplomacy and development assistance, the power of our military, and most importantly, the compassion of our country. And this morning I'm joined by several members of my national security team who are leading this coordinated response. I've made it clear to each of these leaders that Haiti must be a top priority for their departments and agencies right now. This is one of those moments that calls out for American leadership. For the sake of our citizens who are in Haiti, for the sake of the Haitian people, who have suffered so much, and for the sake of our common humanity, we stand in solidarity with our neighbors to the south, knowing that, but for the grace of God, there we go. This morning I can report that the first waves of our rescue and relief workers are on the ground and at work. A survey team worked overnight to identify priority areas for assistance and shared the results of that review throughout the United States Government and with international partners who are also sending support. Search and rescue teams are actively working to save lives. Our military has secured the airport and prepared it to receive the heavy equipment and resources that are on the way and to receive them around the clock, 24 hours a day. An airlift has been set up to deliver high-priority items like water and medicine. And we're coordinating closely with the Haitian Government, the United Nations, and other countries who are also on the ground. Now, we have no higher priority than the safety of American citizens, and we've airlifted injured Americans out of Haiti. We're running additional evacuations and will continue to do so in the days ahead. I know that many Americans, especially Haitian Americans, are desperate for information about their family and friends, and the State Department has set up a phone number and e-mail address that you can find at www.state.cov--www.state.gov--to inquire about your loved ones. And you should know that we will not rest until we account for our fellow Americans in harm's way. Even as we move as quickly as possible, it will take hours, and in many cases days, to get all of our people and resources on the ground. Right now in Haiti roads are impassable, the main port is badly damaged, communications are just beginning to come online, and aftershocks continue. None of this will seem quick enough if you have a loved one who's trapped, if you're sleeping on the streets, if you can't feed your children. But it's important that everybody in Haiti understand, at this very moment one of the largest relief efforts in our recent history is moving towards Haiti. More American search and rescue teams are coming, more food, more water, doctors, nurses, paramedics, more of the people, equipment, and capabilities that can make the difference between life and death. The United States Armed Forces are also on their way to support this effort. Several Coast Guard cutters are already there, providing everything from basic services like water to vital technical support for this massive logistical operation. Elements of the Army's 82d Airborne Division will arrive today. We're also deploying a Marine expeditionary unit, the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, and the Navy's hospital ship, the Comfort. And today I'm also announcing an immediate investment of $100 million to support our relief efforts. This will mean more of the life-saving equipment, food, water, and medicine that will be needed. This investment will grow over the coming year as we embark on the long-term recovery from this unimaginable tragedy. The United States of America will also forge the partnerships that this undertaking demands. We will partner with the Haitian people. And that includes the Government of Haiti, which needs our support as they recover from the devastation of this earthquake. It also includes the many Haitian Americans who are determined to help their friends and family. And I've asked Vice President Biden to meet in south Florida this weekend with members of the Haitian American community and with responders who are mobilizing to help the Haitian people. Now, we will partner with the United Nations and its dedicated personnel and peacekeepers, especially those from Brazil, who are already on the ground due to their outstanding peacekeeping efforts there. And I want to say that our hearts go out to the United Nations, which has experienced one of the greatest losses in its history. We have no doubt that we can carry on the work that was done by so many of the U.N. effort that have been lost, and we see that their legacy is Haiti's hope for the future. Now, we will partner with other nations and organizations. And that's why I've been reaching out to leaders from across the Americas and beyond who are sending resources to support this effort. And we will join with the strong network of nongovernmental organizations across the country who understand the daily struggles of the Haitian people. Yet even as we bring our resources to bear on this emergency, we need to summon the tremendous generosity and compassion of the American people. I want to thank the many Americans who have already contributed to this effort. I want to encourage all Americans who want to help to go to whitehouse.gov to learn more. And in the days ahead, we will continue to work with those individuals and organizations who want to assist this effort so that you can do so. Finally, I want to speak directly to the people of Haiti: Few in the world have endured the hardships that you have known. Long before this tragedy, daily life itself was often a bitter struggle. And after suffering so much for so long, to face this new horror must cause some to look up and ask, have we somehow been forsaken? To the people of Haiti, we say clearly and with conviction: You will not be forsaken; you will not be forgotten. In this, your hour of greatest need, America stands with you. The world stands with you. We know that you are a strong and resilient people. You have endured a history of slavery and struggle, of natural disaster and recovery. And through it all, your spirit has been unbroken and your faith has been unwavering. So today, you must know that help is arriving; much, much more help is on the way. Thank you very much, everybody.","Haiti's strongest earthquake in more than two centuries rocked the Caribbean nation on Tuesday, causing dozens of buildings to collapse and raising fears that many people have died, officials and witnesses said.

Witnesses reported seeing dead bodies lying on the street and hearing cries for help in the impoverished and crowded capital of Port-au-Prince, located just 10 miles northwest of the earthquake's epicenter, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

""I saw dead bodies, people are screaming, they are on the street panicking, people are hurt,"" Raphaelle Chenet, the administrator of Mercy and Sharing, a charity that takes care of 109 orphans, said in a telephone interview from the capital. ""There are a lot of wounded, broken heads, broken arms.""

A hospital in Port-au-Prince collapsed, along with dozens of other buildings, including at one building in the presidential compound and one other government ministry building, according to Alice Blanchet, a special adviser to the Haitian government. Other landmark buildings in the capital, including the U.N. headquarters and the Hotel Montana, sustained heavy damage, witnesses said.

Ms. Blanchet, who had been in contact with several Haitian government officials, said the building that collapsed in the presidential compound was not the main presidential palace.

""I think the only good news was that it hit late and many of the people who would have been working in the buildings were on the street or at home,"" she said.

The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations said U.N. headquarters in the capital ""sustained serious damage.""

""For the moment, a large number of personnel remain unaccounted for,"" the U.N. said in a statement Tuesday.

""At this time of tragedy, I am very concerned for the people of Haiti and also for the many United Nations staff who serve there,"" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement.

In Port-au-Prince, many houses built on steep ravines collapsed, Ms. Chenet and other witnesses said. Ms. Chenet said she heard a few explosions, which she believed to be gas explosions. The orphans in the two institutions run by Mercy and Sharing weren't hurt, she said.

President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with the people of Haiti, and U.S. officials said they would consider immediate humanitarian aid.

""Clearly, there's going to be serious loss of life in this,"" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Philip J. Crowley told reporters.

At least 1.8 million people live within the area where the magnitude-7 quake was most intense, John Bellini, a geophysicist at the USGS, told The Wall Street Journal. ""With a strong and shallow earthquake like this in such a populated area, it could really cause substantial damage,"" he said.

Nightfall and the chaos after the quake made it too early to estimate the extent of the casualties. Disaster specialists said various mathematical models for an earthquake of such magnitude in Haiti predict that as many as 4,000 people could have been killed.

The Greek Ambassador to Venezuela, Efstathios Daras, who is also representing Greece in Haiti said: ""We fear major loss of life, maybe in the thousands or tens of thousands."" He described reports of victims trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings.

""Survivors are using their hands to help get trapped people out. There are fears of big aftershocks which could make the situation even worse. There is huge damage to the infrastructure. We can't get through anymore. All phone lines are down.""

Francis Ghesquiere, lead disaster risk management specialist at the World Bank, said the toll would be exacerbated by the lack of zoning, building codes, and emergency preparedness in a country with a notoriously weak central government. Immediate recovery efforts could be hampered by the same issues until foreign assistance arrives.

Security problems could also arise if victims and others, seeking to take advantage of the chaos, resort to looting in the scramble for supplies. Such events have followed previous disasters in Haiti and now, despite the presence of a U.N. peacekeeping force, ""the security situation could be a big problem,"" warned Mr. Ghesquiere.

The quake was the most powerful to hit Haiti since at least 1770, according to USGS records, Mr. Bellini said. ""This isn't normally an earthquake-prone place,"" he said.

The quake was reportedly felt as far away as Venezuela.

Latin America is no stranger to deadly earthquakes. In 1972, a 6.2-magnitude quake hit Managua, Nicaragua, killing between 3,000 and 7,000 people. In 1976, Guatemala was racked by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that killed 23,000. And in 1985, an 8.1-magnitude earthquake battered Mexico City, killing at least 10,000 and perhaps many thousands more.

On Tuesday, within minutes of the original tremor, two aftershocks rolled through the area, with magnitudes of 5.9 and 5.5.

The country has also been shaken by political instability. In 2004, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a fiery former Catholic priest, was overthrown by a rebellion of former soldiers and flown into exile in South Africa.

In 2008, the country was shaken as thousands took to the streets to protest the high prices of food. Eight in ten Haitians live in poverty, according to the CIA World Factbook.

An 11,000-strong force of U.N. peacekeepers, led by elements of the Brazilian army, have been in Haiti since Mr. Aristide's overthrow to help maintain law and order. Aside from natural disasters, the island, which is on an important drug smuggling route from South America, has had to deal with the violence and corruption engendered by drug trafficking.

Rep. Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere subcommittee, said: ""This is the worst possible time for a natural disaster in Haiti, a country which is still recovering from the devastating storms of just over a year ago.""

The American Red Cross said it will send $500,000 in emergency funding, and dispatch local responders to assess the situation. ""As with most earthquakes, we expect to see immediate needs for food, water, temporary shelter, medical services and emotional support,"" the organization said Tuesday evening.

Americans with roots in the country issued pleas for help. ""If you have any heart at all . . . please . . . get up and do something. Make a donation,"" said Jozy Altidore, a member of the U.S. national soccer team whose parents were both born in Haiti, in a Twitter feed.

Haiti has had a turbulent history alternating between dictatorship, civil war and coups since black slaves defeated Napoleonic troops to declare its independence in 1804, becoming the world's first black republic.

The country was largely isolated during the 19th century by European powers that didn't want to encourage other slave rebellions. Beset by chaos and civil war, Haiti was occupied by the U.S., which sent Marines to run the country from 1915 to 1934. From 1957 to 1986, the island was ruled by first by dictator Francois Duvalier who was succeeded by his son Jean-Claude, known as ""Baby Doc,"" who was overthrown in 1986.
","SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic A fierce earthquake struck Haiti late Tuesday afternoon, causing a crowded hospital to collapse, leveling countless shantytown dwellings and bringing even more suffering to a nation that was already the hemisphereâs poorest and most disaster-prone.

The earthquake, the worst in the region in more than 200 years, left the country in a shambles. As night fell in Port-au-Prince, Haitiâs capital, fires burned near the shoreline downtown, but otherwise the city fell into darkness. The electricity was out, telephones were not working and relief workers struggled to make their way through streets blocked by rubble.

In the chaos, it was not possible for officials to determine how many people had been killed and injured, but they warned that the casualties could be substantial.

The physical toll was easier to assess. The headquarters of the United Nations mission was seriously damaged, the United Nations said in a statement, and many employees were missing. Part of the national palace had collapsed, The Associated Press reported.

A hospital collapsed in PÃ©tionville, a hillside district in Port-au-Prince that is home to many diplomats and wealthy Haitians, a videographer for The Associated Press said. And an American government official reported seeing houses that had tumbled into a ravine.

Tequila Minsky, a photographer based in New York who was in Port-au-Prince, said that a wall at the front of the Hotel Oloffson had fallen, killing a passer-by. A number of nearby buildings had crumbled, trapping people, she said, and a Unibank bank building was badly damaged. People were screaming.

âIt was general mayhem,â Ms. Minsky said.

The earthquake, with a magnitude estimated at 7.0, struck just before 5 p.m. about 10 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, the United States Geological Survey said. Many aftershocks followed and more were expected, said David Wald, a Geological Survey seismologist.

âThe main issue here will probably be shaking,â he said, âand this is an area that is particularly vulnerable in terms of construction practice, and with a high population density. There could be a high number of casualties.â

âThere is a blanket of dust rising from the valley south of the capital,â agency officials said Ms. van de Wetering had told them. âWe can hear people calling for help from every corner. The aftershocks are ongoing and making people very nervous.â

The earthquake could be felt across the border in the Dominican Republic, on the eastern part of the island of Hispaniola. High-rise buildings in the capital, Santo Domingo, shook and sent people streaming down stairways into the streets, fearing that the tremor could intensify.

Haiti sits on a large fault that has caused catastrophic quakes in the past, but this one was described as among the most powerful to hit the region. With many poor residents living in tin-roof shacks that sit precariously on steep ravines and with much of the construction in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in the country of questionable quality, the expectation was that the quake caused major damage to buildings and significant loss of life.

âEverybody is just totally, totally freaked out and shaken,â Henry Bahn, an official of the United States Department of Agriculture who was visiting Haiti, told The Associated Press. âThe sky is just gray with dust.â

Haitiâs many man-made woes its dire poverty, political infighting and proclivity for insurrection have been exacerbated repeatedly by natural disasters. At the end of 2008, four hurricanes flooded whole towns, knocked out bridges and left a destitute population in even more desperate conditions.

The United States and other countries have devoted significant humanitarian support to Haiti, financing a large United Nations peacekeeping mission that has recently reported major gains in controlling crime. International aid has also supported an array of organizations aimed at raising the countryâs dismal health and education levels.

Emergency meetings were being held in Washington, and President Obama issued a statement saying that administration officials were closely monitoring the situation.

âWe stand ready to assist the people of Haiti,â Mr. Obama said.

The Caribbean is not usually considered a seismic danger zone, but earthquakes have struck here in the past.

âThereâs a history of large, devastating earthquakes,â said Paul Mann, a senior research scientist at the Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas, âbut theyâre separated by hundreds of years.â

Most of Haiti lies on the Gonave microplate, a sliver of the earthâs crust between the much larger North American plate to the north and the Caribbean plate to the south. The earthquake on Tuesday occurred when what appears to be part of the southern fault zone broke and slid.

The fault is similar in structure to the San Andreas fault that slices through California, Dr. Mann said.

Such earthquakes, which are called strike-slip, tend to be shallow and produce violent shaking at the surface.

âThey can be very devastating, especially when there are cities nearby,â Dr. Mann said.

Victor Tsai, a seismologist at the National Earthquake Information Center of the United States Geological Survey, said the depth of Tuesdayâs earthquake was only about six miles and the quake was a 9 on a 1-to-10 scale that measures ground shaking. âWe expect substantial damage from this event,â he said.

In the Little Haiti neighborhood of Miami, customers began streaming into the Louis Market shortly after news of the earthquake hit the airwaves. They were buying $5 phone cards in a desperate attempt to reach relatives in Haiti.

âEveryone who walks in here is crazy, worried, depressed,â said Myrlande Cherenfant, 20.

At the Notre Dame de Haiti Roman Catholic church, a handful of parishioners in red-cushioned seats pressed redial on their phones over and over. Some said that they had been able to get through immediately after the earthquake.

âI was able to talk to a priest in Haiti,â the Rev. Reginald Jean-Mary said. âThe only word I heard was âcatastropheâ and then it cut off.â

He said that in a later call he was told that the cathedral in Port-au-Prince had been destroyed and that other churches had been damaged.

Jean-Robert Lafortune, executive director of the Miami-based Haitian American Grassroots Coalition, said that Haiti had endured âa cycle of natural disasters and man-made disasters, and this is one more big catastrophe.â

âWe are in trauma,â he said. âWe have loved ones there and many of them will be victims. Weâre calling and calling, but thereâs nothing on the other end.â

16,16,2010-03-04-CallForHealthCareVote.txt,"Thank you so much, all of you, for joining us today.Â  And I want to thank Julie, Barbara, Roland, Stephen, Renee, and Christopher, standing behind me -- physicians, physicians assistants, and nurses who understand how important it is for us to make much needed changes in our health care system. I want to thank all of you who are here today.Â  I want to specially recognize two people who have been working tirelessly on that -- on this effort, my Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius -- as well as our quarterback for health reform out of the White House, Nancy-Ann DeParle. We began our push to reform health insurance last March, in this room, with doctors and nurses who know the system best.Â  And so itâs fitting to be joined by all of you as we bring this journey to a close.Â Â Â Â  Last Thursday, I spent seven hours at a summit where Democrats and Republicans engaged in a public and very substantive discussion about health care.Â  This meeting capped off a debate that began with a similar summit nearly one year ago.Â  And since then, every idea has been put on the table.Â  Every argument has been made.Â  Everything there is to say about health care has been said -- and just about everybody has said it.Â  So now is the time to make a decision about how to finally reform health care so that it works, not just for the insurance companies, but for Americaâs families and Americaâs businesses. Now, where both sides say they agree is that the status quo is not working for the American people.Â  Health insurance is becoming more expensive by the day.Â  Families canât afford it.Â  Businesses canât afford it.Â  The federal government canât afford it.Â  Smaller businesses and individuals who donât get coverage at work are squeezed especially hard.Â  And insurance companies freely ration health care based on whoâs sick and whoâs healthy; who can pay and who canât.Â  That's the status quo.Â  That's the system we have right now. Democrats and Republicans agree that this is a serious problem for America.Â  And we agree that if we do nothing -- if we throw up our hands and walk away -- itâs a problem that will only grow worse.Â  Nobody disputes that.Â  More Americans will lose their family's health insurance if they switch jobs or lose their job.Â  More small businesses will be forced to choose between health care and hiring.Â  More insurance companies will deny people coverage who have preexisting conditions, or they'll drop people's coverage when they get sick and need it most.Â  And the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid will sink our government deeper and deeper and deeper into debt.Â  On all of this we agree.Â So the question is, what do we do about it?Â  On one end of the spectrum, there are some who've suggested scrapping our system of private insurance and replacing it with a government-run health care system.Â  And though many other countries have such a system, in America it would be neither practical nor realistic. On the other end of the spectrum, there are those, and this includes most Republicans in Congress, who believe the answer is to loosen regulations on the insurance industry -- whether it's state consumer protections or minimum standards for the kind of insurance they can sell.Â  The argument is, is that that will somehow lower costs.Â  I disagree with that approach.Â  I'm concerned that this would only give the insurance industry even freer rein to raise premiums and deny care. So I don't believe we should give government bureaucrats or insurance company bureaucrats more control over health care in America.Â  I believe it's time to give the American people more control over their health care and their health insurance.Â  I don't believe we can afford to leave life-and-death decisions about health care to the discretion of insurance company executives alone.Â  I believe that doctors and nurses and physician assistants like the ones in this room should be free to decide what's best for their patients. Now, the proposal I put forward gives Americans more control over their health insurance and their health care by holding insurance companies more accountable.Â  It builds on the current system where most Americans get their health insurance from their employer.Â  If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.Â  If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.Â  I can tell you as the father of two young girls, I would not want any plan that interferes with the relationship between a family and their doctor.Â  Essentially, my proposal would change three things about the current health care system.Â  First, it would end the worst practices of insurance companies.Â  No longer would they be able to deny your coverage because of a preexisting condition.Â  No longer would they be able to drop your coverage because you got sick.Â  No longer would they be able to force you to pay unlimited amounts of money out of your own pocket.Â  No longer would they be able to arbitrarily and massively raise premiums like Anthem Blue Cross recently tried to do in California -- up to 39 percent increases in one year in the individual market.Â  Those practices would end.Â  Second, my proposal would give uninsured individuals and small business owners the same kind of choice of private health insurance that members of Congress get for themselves -- because if itâs good enough for members of Congress, itâs good enough for the people who pay their salaries. The reason federal employees get a good deal on health insurance is that we all participate in an insurance market where insurance companies give better coverage and better rates, because they get more customers.Â  It's an idea that many Republicans have embraced in the past, before politics intruded.Â  And my proposal says that if you still canât afford the insurance in this new marketplace, even though it's going to provide better deals for people than they can get right now in the individual marketplace, then we'll offer you tax credits to do so -- tax credits that add up to the largest middle-class tax cut for health care in history.Â  After all, the wealthiest among us can already buy the best insurance there is, and the least well off are able to get coverage through Medicaid.Â  So it's the middle class that gets squeezed, and thatâs who we have to help. Now, it is absolutely true that all of this will cost some money -- about $100 billion per year.Â  But most of this comes from the nearly $2 trillion a year that America already spends on health care -- but a lot of it is not spent wisely.Â  A lot of that money is being wasted or spent badly.Â  So within this plan, weâre going to make sure the dollars we spend go towards making insurance more affordable and more secure.Â  Weâre going to eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go to insurance and pharmaceutical companies; set a new fee on insurance companies that stand to gain a lot of money and a lot of profits as millions of Americans are able to buy insurance; and we're going to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share on Medicare.Â  The bottom line is our proposal is paid for.Â  And all the new money generated in this plan goes back to small businesses and middle-class families who can't afford health insurance.Â  It would also lower prescription drug prices for seniors.Â  And it would help train new doctors and nurses and physician assistants to provide care for American families. Finally, my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for millions -- families, businesses, and the federal government.Â  We have now incorporated most of the serious ideas from across the political spectrum about how to contain the rising cost of health care -- ideas that go after the waste and abuse in our system, especially in programs like Medicare.Â  But we do this while protecting Medicare benefits, and extending the financial stability of the program by nearly a decade.Â Â Â Â  Our cost-cutting measures mirror most of the proposals in the current Senate bill, which reduces most people's premiums and brings down our deficit by up to a trillion dollars over the next two decades -- brings down our deficit.Â  Those aren't my numbers; those are the savings determined by the Congressional Budget Office, which is the Washington acronym for the nonpartisan, independent referee of Congress in terms of how much stuff costs. So that's our proposal.Â  This is where we've ended up.Â  It's an approach that has been debated and changed and I believe improved over the last year.Â  It incorporates the best ideas from Democrats and Republicans -- including some of the ideas that Republicans offered during the health care summit, like funding state grants on medical malpractice reform, and curbing waste and fraud and abuse in the health care system.Â  My proposal also gets rid of many of the provisions that had no place in health care reform -- provisions that were more about winning individual votes in Congress than improving health care for all Americans.Â  Now, despite all that we agree on and all the Republican ideas we've incorporated, many -- probably most -- Republicans in Congress just have a fundamental disagreement over whether we should have more or less oversight of insurance companies.Â  And if they truly believe that less regulation would lead to higher quality, more affordable health insurance, then they should vote against the proposal I've put forward. Now, some also believe that we should, instead of doing what I'm proposing, pursue a piecemeal approach to health insurance reform, where we tinker around the edges of this challenge for the next few years.Â  Even those who acknowledge the problem of the uninsured say we just can't afford to help them right now -- which is why the Republican proposal only covers 3 million uninsured Americans while we cover over 31 million.Â  The problem with that approach is that unless everyone has access to affordable coverage, you can't prevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions; you can't limit the amount families are forced to pay out of their own pockets.Â  The insurance reforms rest on everybody having access to coverage.Â  And you also don't do anything about the fact that taxpayers currently end up subsidizing the uninsured when they're forced to go to the emergency room for care, to the tune of about a thousand bucks per family.Â  You can't get those savings if those people are still going to the emergency room.Â  So the fact is, health reform only works if you take care of all of these problems at once.Â  Now, both during and after last week's summit, Republicans in Congress insisted that the only acceptable course on health care reform is to start over.Â  But given these honest and substantial differences between the parties about the need to regulate the insurance industry and the need to help millions of middle-class families get insurance, I don't see how another year of negotiations would help.Â  Moreover, the insurance companies aren't starting over.Â  They're continuing to raise premiums and deny coverage as we speak.Â  For us to start over now could simply lead to delay that could last for another decade, or even more.Â  The American people, and the U.S. economy, just can't wait that long.Â  So, no matter which approach you favor, I believe the United States Congress owes the American people a final vote on health care reform. We have debated this issue thoroughly, not just for the past year but for decades.Â  Reform has already passed the House with a majority.Â  It has already passed the Senate with a supermajority of 60 votes.Â  And now it deserves the same kind of up or down vote that was cast on welfare reform, that was cast on the Children's Health Insurance Program, that was used for COBRA health coverage for the unemployed, and, by the way, for both Bush tax cuts -- all of which had to pass Congress with nothing more than a simple majority.Â Â Â  I, therefore, ask leaders in both houses of Congress to finish their work and schedule a vote in the next few weeks.Â  From now until then, I will do everything in my power to make the case for reform.Â  And I urge every American who wants this reform to make their voice heard as well -- every family, every business, every patient, every doctor, every nurse, every physicianâs assistant.Â  Make your voice heard.Â  This has been a long and wrenching debate.Â  It has stoked great passions among the American people and their representatives.Â  And that's because health care is a difficult issue.Â  It is a complicated issue.Â  If it was easy, it would have been solved long ago.Â  As all of you know from experience, health care can literally be an issue of life or death.Â  And as a result, it easily lends itself to demagoguery and political gamesmanship, and misrepresentation and misunderstanding.Â  But thatâs not an excuse for those of us who were sent here to lead.Â  That's not an excuse for us to walk away.Â  We canât just give up because the politics are hard.Â  I know thereâs been a fascination, bordering on obsession, in this media town about what passing health insurance reform would mean for the next election and the one after that.Â  How will this play?Â  What will happen with the polls?Â  I will leave it to others to sift through the politics, because thatâs not what this is about.Â  Thatâs not why weâre here.Â  This is about what reform would mean for the mother with breast cancer whose insurance company will finally have to pay for her chemotherapy.Â  This is about what reform would mean for the small business owner who will no longer have to choose between hiring more workers or offering coverage to the employees she has.Â  This is about what reform would mean for middle-class families who will be able to afford health insurance for the very first time in their lives and get a regular checkup once in a while, and have some security about their children if they get sick.Â  This is about what reform would mean for all those men and women Iâve met over the last few years whoâve been brave enough to share their stories.Â  When we started our push for reform last year, I talked to a young mother in Wisconsin named Laura Klitzka.Â  She has two young children.Â  She thought she had beaten her breast cancer but then later discovered it had spread to her bones.Â  She and her husband were working and had insurance, but their medical bills still landed them in debt.Â  And now she spends time worrying about that debt when all she wants to do is spend time with her children and focus on getting well.Â  This should not happen in the United States of America.Â  And it doesnât have to.Â  In the end, that's what this debate is about.Â  It's about what kind of country we want to be.Â  It's about the millions of lives that would be touched and, in some cases, saved by making private health insurance more secure and more affordable.Â  So at stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem, but our ability to solve any problem.Â  The American people want to know if it's still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and their future.Â  They are waiting for us to act.Â  They are waiting for us to lead.Â  And as long as I hold this office, I intend to provide that leadership.Â  I do not know how this plays politically, but I know it's right.Â  And so I ask Congress to finish its work, and I look forward to signing this reform into law.Â  Thank you very much, everybody. Let's get it done.","President Barack Obama opened the final act of a year-long drama over health-care legislation Wednesday, calling on Democrats in Congress to approve the sweeping bill despite political risks and Republican opposition.

The president vowed to rally Americans and wavering lawmakers alike. White House aides said a pair of trips next week will be followed by a stream of public and private lobbying. The White House wants final votes by month's end.

""At stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem, but our ability to solve any problem,"" Mr. Obama told a crowd of white-coated doctors and nurses in the East Room, where a year ago he started the drive for the legislation.

With polls showing that the legislation is unpopular and congressional Democrats bracing for big losses in this fall's elections, the president urged them to ignore the politics. ""I do not know how this plays politically, but I know it's right,"" he said. ""Let's get it done.""

Democrats and the White House are balancing high risks and rewards. Passing the health overhaul would fulfill a decades-old Democratic dream, bringing insurance to some 30 million Americans, and represent the greatest expansion of coverage since Medicare was created in 1965. But if the public judges the overhaul harshly, it is likely to cost some Democrats their seats, and the party's majority in the House could be at risk.

The White House argues that, despite the negative poll numbers, Americans will like the measure if it becomes law, since the focus then could shift from the legislative process to the measure's impact. Polling does find stronger support for the bill's individual provisions than for the package as a whole.

Mr. Obama Wednesday also highlighted a handful of Republican ideas used in the legislation. Republicans dismissed the gesture as insufficient.

""You can't add a couple of Republican sprinkles on the top of a 2,700-page bill and claim that it's bipartisan,"" said House Minority Leader John Boehner (R., Ohio).

Rejecting Republican calls to start again, the president said that given the ""honest and substantial differences between the parties,"" there was no point. ""Everything there is to say about health care has been said,"" he said to laughter, ""and just about everybody has said it.""

For the first time, the president explicitly called on Congress to use a procedural technique that will let the Senate give its final approval with a simple majority vote. He didn't use the word for that technique -- ""reconciliation"" -- but characterized the process as a way of calling a simple ""up or down vote"" that has been used for big bills before.

Republicans say the reconciliation process was never intended for such major legislation. ""History is clear: Big legislation always requires big majorities,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said on the floor Wednesday.

Democrats need to approve the changes in the Senate through reconciliation because they no longer have 60 Senate votes necessary to end a standard debate, due to the loss last month of the Massachusetts seat long held by the late Edward Kennedy. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs downplayed the significance of the reconciliation measure, calling it a set of ""technical corrections"" to the original Senate measure. The reconciliation version contains some significant differences from the Senate bill, including taxes on the wealthy and lower levies on high-value health-insurance plans.

Under the Democratic plan, the process would work like this: First, the House would vote on the bill that the Senate approved in late December. House leaders hope to pass both that Senate bill, and then the reconciliation package, by March 17. After that, the Senate would need to pass the reconciliation bill. By month's end, Democrats hope, the measure would go to the president to be signed into law.

The final push by Mr. Obama amounts to a critical test of his powers of persuasion. Democrats could face a tough decision, balancing the risk of passing potentially unpopular legislation against the risk of inaction and the stigma of having labored for more than a year to produce nothing. Democratic leaders say lawmakers who already voted yes once will be attacked no matter what, but will be in better shape politically if they have something to show for it.

White House aides vowed the president would use all tactics at his disposal to rally support. That includes speeches around the country, starting with a trip to Philadelphia on Monday, media interviews and direct communication with supporters.

He'll also be lobbying lawmakers directly, aides said, including at a White House reception Wednesday that includes a half-dozen Democrats who voted no last year and are being targeted to change their votes.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats have started writing the formal reconciliation bill and are close to a final agreement, aides said. They intend to send it to the Congressional Budget Office for evaluation by the end of the week, a leadership aide said.

To assure the House that the Senate actually will pass the reconciliation measure, senators are considering sending a letter next week with at least 51 senators' signatures promising action, a Senate leadership aide said.

House leaders face the tougher task in rallying support. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she will be able to corral the votes, but she hasn't yet secured them. It will require persuading several Democrats who voted no last year to change their votes to yes, to make up for supporters who have turned against the measure or left Congress.

Navigating reconciliation in the Senate poses its own hurdles. Republicans plan to make a series of rule-oriented challenges to the process in order to slow it down and stoke public unease. Republicans ""will employ every strategy possible because we know that this will be a disaster for this country,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).

Some Democrats say the partisan rancor the process would generate could drain so much political will from the Senate that it will make it tough to complete other major legislation this year. ""It would probably bring everything else to a stop,"" said Sen. Evan Bayh (D., Ind.).

The reconciliation process prevents Republicans from blocking the bill using a filibuster. But it doesn't stop them from introducing an unlimited number of amendments. Democrats say that, under a worst-case scenario, that could eat up weeks of time on the floor and force the Senate's parliamentarian to rule that the amendments weren't offered in good faith.

Wednesday's address capped two weeks of intense intervention into the health debate by the president, who has been criticized for staying too hands-off previously. White House aides say his steps were needed to propel the bill following the Massachusetts loss.
","WASHINGTON â President Obama, beginning his final push for a health care overhaul, called Wednesday for Congress to allow an âup or down voteâ on the measure, and sketched out an ambitious â and, some Democrats said, unrealistic â timetable for his party to pass a bill on its own within weeks.

âI believe the United States Congress owes the American people a final vote on health care reform,â Mr. Obama said during a 20-minute speech in the East Room of the White House. He said there was no point in starting over, as Republicans are demanding, and called on nervous Democrats to stick with him, declaring there was no reason âfor those of us who were sent here to lead to just walk away.â

The speech, less than a week after Mr. Obama held a high-profile televised health care forum, will usher in what White House officials say will be their last campaign to bring Washingtonâs long and contentious health care debate to a close â with a bill-signing ceremony at the end.

On Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will meet at the White House with insurance industry executives to spotlight unpopular rate increases; next week, Mr. Obama will travel to Missouri and Pennsylvania to stump for the health care bill.

In his remarks, the president refrained from using the word âreconciliation,â the parliamentary tactic that Democrats are expected to employ to avoid a Republican filibuster and win passage with a simple majority. But he made clear that was his intent, and reminded Americans that despite current Republican objections, other major bills had been passed using the same tactic.

âReform has already passed the House with a majority. It has already passed the Senate with a supermajority of 60 votes,â Mr. Obama said. âAnd now it deserves the same kind of up or down vote that was cast on welfare reform, that was cast on the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program, that was used for Cobra health coverage for the unemployed and, by the way, for both Bush tax cuts â all of which had to pass Congress with nothing more than a simple majority.â

Republicans were furious.

âTheyâre making a vigorous effort to try to jam this down the throats of the American people, who donât want it,â the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, told reporters after Mr. Obamaâs remarks. âWe think thatâs a policy mistake, and we think resorting to these kind of tactics, to thumb your noses at the American people, is something that ought to be resisted.â

On Capitol Hill, the strategy could prove a heavy lift for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, who are now under intense pressure from the White House to translate Mr. Obamaâs wishes for a final bill into legislative language. Both leaders issued statements Wednesday praising Mr. Obama and vowing to press ahead. But, noticeably, neither publicly committed to Mr. Obamaâs timetable.

Privately, Senate leadership aides said Mr. Obamaâs deadline could be difficult to meet. The tentative plan is for the House to adopt the bill passed by the Senate, and for both chambers to use reconciliation to pass a package of changes that would bridge gaps between the initial House and Senate versions.

But the final language must still be sent to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for evaluation, a process that takes time. Many aspects of the legislation remain unresolved, and rank-and-file Democrats in the House remain deeply uneasy over both the substance of the bill and the process by which it would be adopted.

Ms. Pelosi does not yet have the votes she needs to pass the legislation. She faces complex negotiations with both the moderate and liberal wings of her party to come up with a package that can pass the House without deviating so much from the existing Senate version that Mr. Reid would have trouble assembling a majority for the final vote in the Senate.

âI am not inclined to support the Senate version,â said Representative Shelley Berkley, Democrat of Nevada, who voted for the House bill in November. âI would like something more concrete than a promise. The Senate cannot promise its way out of a brown paper bag.â

As Democrats prepared for a final showdown with Republicans, other potential stumbling blocks emerged. House Democrats from New York met Wednesday with Ms. Pelosi to discuss their concern that the emerging bill would shortchange their state on Medicaid and other issues.

âI am very, very disappointed and unhappy,â said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York. âThe White House is taking us for granted, and they shouldnât.â

Supporters of abortion rights, in and out of Congress, said Wednesday that they were alarmed at the prospect that lawmakers might impose new restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion in the push to enact sweeping health legislation. Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said language restricting insurersâ ability to cover abortions âremains in the presidentâs proposal, and we are very concerned about that.â

Friday will mark one year since Mr. Obama laid out his plans for a health care overhaul with a high-profile forum at the White House, where he engaged in a lively debate with lawmakers of both parties and executives from the insurance, hospital and pharmaceutical industries. On Wednesday, the scene at the White House was far different.

Mr. Obama spoke, without taking questions, to a group of sympathetic medical professionals, many of them clad in white lab coats to provide a TV-friendly image. After 12 months of legislative hearings, town hall meetings, speeches, polls and debates, Mr. Obama was in the position of selling not only the public, but his own party, on his top domestic priority.

âThe American people want to know if itâs still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and their future,â Mr. Obama said. âThey are waiting for us to act. They are waiting for us to lead. And as long as I hold this office, I intend to provide that leadership. I donât know how this plays politically, but I know itâs right.â

Seeking to reassure wavering Democrats that he would back them up, he pledged to do âeverything in my power to make the case for reform.â

Moments after he finished speaking, the White House announced plans for him to visit Pennsylvania and Missouri â states that are home to vulnerable Democrats like Representative Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania and Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, who were among 39 Democrats to vote against the health measure when it passed the House last year. If Mr. Obama is to sign his legislation into law, he is going to have to convert some of those no votes into yeses; traveling to a lawmakerâs home state could be one way to do that.

Senior advisers to Mr. Obama are betting that the politics of health care will eventually turn in the partyâs favor, if the president can actually sign a bill into law. The legislation includes popular restrictions on the insurance industry; some, like a provision barring insurers from discriminating against children on the basis of pre-existing conditions, would take effect quickly â a point noted by Mr. Obamaâs press secretary, Robert Gibbs.

âThe president has always subscribed to the notion that the politics will catch up,â Mr. Gibbs said.

17,17,2010-03-24-AffordableCareAct.txt,"Today, after almost a century of trying -- Today, after over a year of debate -- Today, after all the votes have been tallied, health insurance reform becomes law in the United States of America -- today. It is fitting that Congress passed this historic legislation this week.Â  For as we mark the turning of spring, we also mark a new season in America.Â  In a few moments, when I sign this bill, all of the overheated rhetoric over reform will finally confront the reality of reform. And while the Senate still has a last round of improvements to make on this historic legislation -- and these are improvements Iâm confident they will make swiftly -- the bill Iâm signing will set in motion reforms that generations of Americans have fought for, and marched for, and hungered to see. It will take four years to implement fully many of these reforms, because we need to implement them responsibly.Â  We need to get this right.Â  But a host of desperately needed reforms will take effect right away. This year, weâll start offering tax credits to about 4 million small businessmen and women to help them cover the cost of insurance for their employees.Â  That happens this year. This year, tens of thousands of uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions, the parents of children who have a preexisting condition, will finally be able to purchase the coverage they need.Â  That happens this year. This year, insurance companies will no longer be able to drop peopleâs coverage when they get sick.Â They wonât be able to place lifetime limits or restrictive annual limits on the amount of care they can receive. This year, all new insurance plans will be required to offer free preventive care.Â  And this year, young adults will be able to stay on their parentsâ policies until theyâre 26 years old.Â  That happens this year. And this year, seniors who fall in the coverage gap known as the doughnut hole will start getting some help.Â  Theyâll receive 250 dollars to help pay for prescriptions, and that will, over time, fill in the doughnut hole.Â  And I want seniors to know, despite what some have said, these reforms will not cut your guaranteed benefits.Â In fact, under this law, Americans on Medicare will receive free preventive care without co-payments or deductibles.Â  That begins this year. Once this reform is implemented, health insurance exchanges will be created, a competitive marketplace where uninsured people and small businesses will finally be able to purchase affordable, quality insurance.Â  They will be able to be part of a big pool and get the same good deal that members of Congress get.Â  Thatâs whatâs going to happen under this reform.Â  And when this exchange is up and running, millions of people will get tax breaks to help them afford coverage, which represents the largest middle-class tax cut for health care in history.Â Â  That's what this reform is about. This legislation will also lower costs for families and for businesses and for the federal government, reducing our deficit by over one trillion dollars in the next two decades.Â  It is paid for.Â  It is fiscally responsible.Â  And it will help lift a decades-long drag on our economy.Â  That's part of what all of you together worked on and made happen. That our generation is able to succeed in passing this reform is a testament to the persistence --- and the character -- of the American people, who championed this cause; who mobilized; who organized; who believed that people who love this country can change it. Itâs also a testament to the historic leadership -- and uncommon courage -- of the men and women of the United States Congress, whoâve taken their lumps during this difficult debate. Audience Member:Â  Yes, we did. President Obama:Â  You know, there are few tougher jobs in politics or government than leading one of our legislative chambers.Â  In each chamber, there are men and women who come from different places and face different pressures, who reach different conclusions about the same things and feel deeply concerned about different things. By necessity, leaders have to speak to those different concerns.Â  It isnât always tidy; it is almost never easy.Â  But perhaps the greatest -- and most difficult -- challenge is to cobble together out of those differences the sense of common interest and common purpose thatâs required to advance the dreams of all people -- especially in a country as large and diverse as ours. And we are blessed by leaders in each chamber who not only do their jobs very well but who never lost sight of that larger mission.Â  They didnât play for the short term; they didnât play to the polls or to politics:Â  One of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Audience:Â  Nancy!Â  Nancy!Â  Nancy!Â  Nancy! President Obama:Â  One of the best majority leaders the Senate has ever had, Mr. Harry Reid. To all of the terrific committee chairs, all the members of Congress who did what was difficult, but did what was right, and passed health care reform -- not just this generation of Americans will thank you, but the next generation of Americans will thank you.Â  And of course, this victory was also made possible by the painstaking work of members of this administration, including our outstanding Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius -- and one of the unsung heroes of this effort, an extraordinary woman who led the reform effort from the White House, Nancy-Ann DeParle.Â  Whereâs Nancy? Today, Iâm signing this reform bill into law on behalf of my mother, who argued with insurance companies even as she battled cancer in her final days. Iâm signing it for Ryan Smith, whoâs here today.Â  He runs a small business with five employees.Â  Heâs trying to do the right thing, paying half the cost of coverage for his workers.Â  This bill will help him afford that coverage. Iâm signing it for 11-year-old Marcelas Owens, whoâs also here.Â Marcelas lost his mom to an illness.Â  And she didnât have insurance and couldnât afford the care that she needed.Â  So in her memory he has told her story across America so that no other children have to go through what his family has experienced. Iâm signing it for Natoma Canfield.Â  Natoma had to give up her health coverage after her rates were jacked up by more than 40 percent.Â  She was terrified that an illness would mean sheâd lose the house that her parents built, so she gave up her insurance.Â  Now sheâs lying in a hospital bed, as we speak, faced with just such an illness, praying that she can somehow afford to get well without insurance.Â  Natomaâs family is here today because Natoma canât be.Â  And her sister Connie is here.Â  Connie, stand up. Iâm signing this bill for all the leaders who took up this cause through the generations -- from Teddy Roosevelt to Franklin Roosevelt, from Harry Truman, to Lyndon Johnson, from Bill and Hillary Clinton, to one of the deans whoâs been fighting this so long, John Dingell.Â  To Senator Ted Kennedy.Â  And itâs fitting that Tedâs widow, Vicki, is here -- itâs fitting that Teddyâs widow, Vicki, is here; and his niece Caroline; his son Patrick, whose vote helped make this reform a reality.Â  I remember seeing Ted walk through that door in a summit in this room a year ago -- one of his last public appearances.Â  And it was hard for him to make it.Â  But he was confident that we would do the right thing. Our presence here today is remarkable and improbable.Â  With all the punditry, all of the lobbying, all of the game-playing that passes for governing in Washington, itâs been easy at times to doubt our ability to do such a big thing, such a complicated thing; to wonder if there are limits to what we, as a people, can still achieve.Â  Itâs easy to succumb to the sense of cynicism about whatâs possible in this country. But today, we are affirming that essential truth -- a truth every generation is called to rediscover for itself -- that we are not a nation that scales back its aspirations.Â  We are not a nation that falls prey to doubt or mistrust.Â  We don't fall prey to fear.Â  We are not a nation that does whatâs easy.Â  Thatâs not who we are.Â  Thatâs not how we got here. We are a nation that faces its challenges and accepts its responsibilities.Â  We are a nation that does what is hard.Â  What is necessary.Â  What is right.Â  Here, in this country, we shape our own destiny.Â  That is what we do.Â  That is who we are.Â  That is what makes us the United States of America.Â  And we have now just enshrined, as soon as I sign this bill, the core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care.Â And it is an extraordinary achievement that has happened because of all of you and all the advocates all across the country. So, thank you.Â  Thank you.Â  God bless you, and may God bless the United States.Â Thank you.Â  Thank you. All right, I would now like to call up to stage some of the members of Congress who helped make this day possible, and some of the Americans who will benefit from these reforms.Â  And weâre going to sign this bill. This is going to take a little while.Â  Iâve got to use every pen, so itâs going to take a really long time.Â I didnât practice.Â  We are done.","President Barack Obama signed into law Tuesday a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. health-care system, as the yearlong political brawl over the measure entered a new phase that might only be settled in this fall's elections.

The audience of about 300 lawmakers, congressional aides and White House staff who had carried the legislation through its improbable course interrupted him repeatedly with standing ovations. Several snapped photos to mark the moment.

The day's events opened an intense White House effort to sell the new law to an often-skeptical public. The president emphasized provisions that take effect right away, such as rules barring insurers from rejecting children who are already sick. He also singled out individual Americans who will be helped, a technique that's likely to be repeated often between now and the November elections.

""After a century of striving, after a year of debate, after a historic vote, health-care reform is no longer an unmet promise. It is the law of the land,"" the president said at a rally after signing the bill.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) scoffed at the ceremonies convened by Democrats, saying the party will pay a price for going against the public will. ""Democrats here in Washington can celebrate all they want. But that celebration is going to be short-lived,"" he said. ""The American people aren't fooled.""

Mr. Obama noted that major parts of the bill will take time to implement, including a requirement that most Americans buy insurance, a government-run exchange to sell coverage and tax credits to defray the cost.

The law also faces a legal challenge. More than a dozen states filed suit Tuesday to stop it, asserting, among other things, that its mandate on individuals to buy insurance was unconstitutional. The Justice Department said it would ""vigorously defend"" the measure.

Nor was the legislative struggle over health-care quite over. A few hours after the signing ceremony, the Senate voted 56-40 to open debate on a package of changes to the law sought by Democrats that Republicans vowed to vigorously oppose. The House approved the changes alongside the main bill Sunday.

In the packed White House East Room, the mood was celebratory, but there were reminders of the political pressures that divided Democrats over the past year and the challenges they faced in implementing the bill and selling it to the public.

Mr. Obama said lawmakers had shown ""uncommon courage"" and noted they had ""taken their lumps during this difficult debate.""

""Yes, we did,"" said Rep. Gary Ackerman (D., N.Y.), to laughter.

Rep. Bart Stupak (D., Mich.), who threatened to vote no over abortion but ultimately voted yes, sealing the bill's passage, was in attendance. So was Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D., Ohio), who bashed the bill but voted for it, saying he didn't want the president and his agenda to fail. And there was Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D., Ark.), who faces a bruising re-election battle and is already under attack for supporting the bill.

Near the front of the room sat Vicki Kennedy, whose late husband, Sen. Edward Kennedy, championed universal health care for decades, but died last August before the bill made it through the Senate.

Vice President Joe Biden offered one of his signature unscripted moments after introducing the president with lavish praise. He leaned into Mr. Obama and whispered, in an aside picked up by a nearby microphone, ""This is a big f------ deal.""

The White House didn't contradict him. Spokesman Robert Gibbs later replied on his Twitter account, ""And yes Mr. Vice President, you're right.""

There didn't appear to be any Republicans in the East Room, which was to be expected because the health-care bill failed to garner a single Republican vote for final passage.

The companion legislation now before the Senate was being considered under so-called reconciliation rules, which provide for only 20 hours of debate and require a simple majority vote for passage instead of the 60 votes needed to defeat an opposition filibuster.

Republicans were still working to slow the process. Under reconciliation, there is no limit on the number of amendments that can be offered on the floor. Republicans Tuesday were readying dozens of amendments. If all of them are offered, the Senate could be plunged into a marathon spate of voting late this week.

The reconciliation bill would beef up subsidies to help individuals buy health insurance and delay the effective date of a new tax on high-cost plans. It also includes a proposal to overhaul the federal student-loan program, ending taxpayer subsidies to banks and shifting lending responsibilities to the government.

The Senate parliamentarian denied a potential challenge that could have brought down the reconciliation bill, congressional aides and lawmakers said.

Under Senate rules, bills affecting Social Security can't proceed under reconciliation. Republicans argued that tax-policy changes in the legislation would result in a reduction of payroll-tax receipts, effectively undermining Social Security, which is funded by payroll levies.

The parliamentarian concluded the argument was without merit.
","For all the political and economic uncertainties about health reform, at least one thing seems clear: The bill that President Obama signed on Tuesday is the federal governmentâs biggest attack on economic inequality since inequality began rising more than three decades ago.

Over most of that period, government policy and market forces have been moving in the same direction, both increasing inequality. The pretax incomes of the wealthy have soared since the late 1970s, while their tax rates have fallen more than rates for the middle class and poor.

Nearly every major aspect of the health bill pushes in the other direction. This fact helps explain why Mr. Obama was willing to spend so much political capital on the issue, even though it did not appear to be his top priority as a presidential candidate. Beyond the health reformâs effect on the medical system, it is the centerpiece of his deliberate effort to end what historians have called the age of Reagan.

Speaking to an ebullient audience of Democratic legislators and White House aides at the bill-signing ceremony on Tuesday, Mr. Obama claimed that health reform would âmark a new season in America.â He added, âWe have now just enshrined, as soon as I sign this bill, the core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care.â

The bill is the most sweeping piece of federal legislation since Medicare was passed in 1965. It aims to smooth out one of the roughest edges in American society â the inability of many people to afford medical care after they lose a job or get sick. And it would do so in large measure by taxing the rich.

A big chunk of the money to pay for the bill comes from lifting payroll taxes on households making more than $250,000. On average, the annual tax bill for households making more than $1 million a year will rise by $46,000 in 2013, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group. Another major piece of financing would cut Medicare subsidies for private insurers, ultimately affecting their executives and shareholders.

The benefits, meanwhile, flow mostly to households making less than four times the poverty level â $88,200 for a family of four people. Those without insurance in this group will become eligible to receive subsidies or to join Medicaid. (Many of the poor are already covered by Medicaid.) Insurance costs are also likely to drop for higher-income workers at small companies.

Finally, the bill will also reduce a different kind of inequality. In the broadest sense, insurance is meant to spread the costs of an individualâs misfortune â illness, death, fire, flood â across society. Since the late 1970s, though, the share of Americans with health insurance has shrunk. As a result, the gap between the economic well-being of the sick and the healthy has been growing, at virtually every level of the income distribution.

The health reform bill will reverse that trend. By 2019, 95 percent of people are projected to be covered, up from 85 percent today (and about 90 percent in the late 1970s). Even affluent families ineligible for subsidies will benefit if they lose their insurance, by being able to buy a plan that can no longer charge more for pre-existing conditions. In effect, healthy families will be picking up most of the bill â and their insurance will be somewhat more expensive than it otherwise would have been.

Much about health reform remains unknown. Maybe it will deliver Congress to the Republicans this fall, or maybe it will help the Democrats keep power. Maybe the billâs attempts to hold down the recent growth of medical costs will prove a big success, or maybe the results will be modest and inadequate. But the ways in which the bill attacks the inequality of the Reagan era â whether you love them or hate them â will probably be around for a long time.

âLegislative majorities come and go,â David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, lamented on Sunday. âThis health care bill is forever.â

Since Mr. Obama began his presidential campaign in 2007, he has had a complicated relationship with the Reagan legacy. He has been more willing than many other Democrats to praise President Reagan. âReaganâs central insight â that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic,â Mr. Obama wrote in his second book, âcontained a good deal of truth.â Most notably, he praised Mr. Reagan as a president who âchanged the trajectory of America.â

But Mr. Obama also argued that the Reagan administration had gone too far, and that if elected, he would try to put the country on a new trajectory. âThe project of the next president,â he said in an interview during the campaign, âis figuring out how you create bottom-up economic growth, as opposed to the trickle-down economic growth.â

Since 1980, median real household income has risen less than 15 percent. The only period of strong middle-class income growth during this time came in the mid- and late 1990s, which by coincidence was also the one time when taxes on the affluent were rising.

For most of the last three decades, tax rates for the wealthy have been falling, while their pretax pay has been rising rapidly. Real incomes at the 99.99th percentile have jumped more than 300 percent since 1980. At the 99th percentile â about $300,000 today â real pay has roughly doubled.

The laissez-faire revolution that Mr. Reagan started did not cause these trends. But its policies â tax cuts, light regulation, a patchwork safety net â have contributed to them.

Health reform hardly solves all of the American economyâs problems. Economic growth over the last decade was slower than in any decade since World War II. The tax cuts of the last 30 years, the two current wars, the Great Recession, the stimulus program and the looming retirement of the baby boomers have created huge deficits. Educational gains have slowed, and the planet is getting hotter.

Above all, the central question that both the Reagan and Obama administrations have tried to answer â what is the proper balance between the market and the government? â remains unresolved. But the bill signed on Tuesday certainly shifts our place on that spectrum.

Before he became Mr. Obamaâs top economic adviser, Lawrence Summers told me a story about helping his daughter study for her Advanced Placement exam in American history. While doing so, Mr. Summers realized that the federal government had not passed major social legislation in decades. There was the frenzy of the New Deal, followed by the G.I. Bill, the Interstate Highway System, civil rights and Medicare â and then nothing worth its own section in the history books.

Now there is.

18,18,2010-04-15-NASAFuture.txt,"Thank you. I want to thank Senator Bill Nelson and NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden for their extraordinary leadership.Â  I want to recognize Dr. Buzz Aldrin as well, whoâs in the house.Â  Four decades ago, Buzz became a legend.Â  But in the four decades since heâs also been one of Americaâs leading visionaries and authorities on human space flight. Few people -- present company excluded -- can claim the expertise of Buzz and Bill and Charlie when it comes to space exploration.Â  I have to say that few people are as singularly unimpressed by Air Force One as those three.Â  Sure, itâs comfortable, but it canât even reach low Earth orbit.Â  And that obviously is in striking contrast to the Falcon 9 rocket we just saw on the launch pad, which will be tested for the very first time in the coming weeks. A couple of other acknowledgments I want to make.Â  Weâve got Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee from Texas visiting us, a big supporter of the space program.Â My director, Office of Science and Technology Policy -- in other words my chief science advisor -- John Holdren is here.Â And most of all I want to acknowledge your congresswoman Suzanne Kosmas, because every time I meet with her, including the flight down here, she reminds me of how important our NASA programs are and how important this facility is.Â  And she is fighting for every single one of you and for her district and for the jobs in her district.Â  And you should know that youâve got a great champion in Congresswoman Kosmas.Â  Please give her a big round of applause. I also want to thank everybody for participating in todayâs conference.Â  And gathered here are scientists, engineers, business leaders, public servants, and a few more astronauts as well.Â  Last but not least, I want to thank the men and women of NASA for welcoming me to the Kennedy Space Center, and for your contributions not only to America, but to the world. Here at the Kennedy Space Center we are surrounded by monuments and milestones of those contributions.Â  It was from here that NASA launched the missions of Mercury and Gemini and Apollo.Â  It was from here that Space Shuttle Discovery, piloted by Charlie Bolden, carried the Hubble Telescope into orbit, allowing us to plumb the deepest recesses of our galaxy.Â  And I should point out, by the way, that in my private office just off the Oval, Iâve got the picture of Jupiter from the Hubble.Â  So thank you, Charlie, for helping to decorate my office.Â  It was from here that men and women, propelled by sheer nerve and talent, set about pushing the boundaries of humanityâs reach. Thatâs the story of NASA.Â  And itâs a story that started a little more than half a century ago, far from the Space Coast, in a remote and desolate region of what is now called Kazakhstan.Â  Because it was from there that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth, which was little more than a few pieces of metal with a transmitter and a battery strapped to the top of a missile.Â  But the world was stunned.Â  Americans were dumbfounded.Â  The Soviets, it was perceived, had taken the lead in a race for which we were not yet fully prepared. But we caught up very quick.Â  President Eisenhower signed legislation to create NASA and to invest in science and math education, from grade school to graduate school.Â  In 1961, President Kennedy boldly declared before a joint session of Congress that the United States would send a man to the Moon and return him safely to the Earth within the decade.Â  And as a nation, we set about meeting that goal, reaping rewards that have in the decades since touched every facet of our lives.Â  NASA was at the forefront.Â  Many gave their careers to the effort.Â  And some have given far more. In the years that have followed, the space race inspired a generation of scientists and innovators, including, Iâm sure, many of you.Â  Itâs contributed to immeasurable technological advances that have improved our health and well-being, from satellite navigation to water purification, from aerospace manufacturing to medical imaging.Â  Although, I have to say, during a meeting right before I came out on stage somebody said, you know, itâs more than just Tang -- and I had to point out I actually really like Tang.Â I thought that was very cool. And leading the world to space helped America achieve new heights of prosperity here on Earth, while demonstrating the power of a free and open society to harness the ingenuity of its people. And on a personal note, I have been part of that generation so inspired by the space program.Â  1961 was the year of my birth -- the year that Kennedy made his announcement.Â  And one of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfatherâs shoulders, waving a flag as astronauts arrived in Hawaii.Â  For me, the space program has always captured an essential part of what it means to be an American -- reaching for new heights, stretching beyond what previously did not seem possible.Â  And so, as President, I believe that space exploration is not a luxury, itâs not an afterthought in Americaâs quest for a brighter future -- it is an essential part of that quest. So today, Iâd like to talk about the next chapter in this story.Â  The challenges facing our space program are different, and our imperatives for this program are different, than in decades past.Â  Weâre no longer racing against an adversary.Â  Weâre no longer competing to achieve a singular goal like reaching the Moon.Â  In fact, what was once a global competition has long since become a global collaboration.Â  But while the measure of our achievements has changed a great deal over the past 50 years, what we do -- or fail to do -- in seeking new frontiers is no less consequential for our future in space and here on Earth. So let me start by being extremely clear:Â  I am 100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future.Â  Because broadening our capabilities in space will continue to serve our society in ways that we can scarcely imagine.Â  Because exploration will once more inspire wonder in a new generation -- sparking passions and launching careers.Â  And because, ultimately, if we fail to press forward in the pursuit of discovery, we are ceding our future and we are ceding that essential element of the American character. I know there have been a number of questions raised about my administrationâs plan for space exploration, especially in this part of Florida where so many rely on NASA as a source of income as well as a source of pride and community.Â  And these questions come at a time of transition, as the space shuttle nears its scheduled retirement after almost 30 years of service.Â  And understandably, this adds to the worries of folks concerned not only about their own futures but about the future of the space program to which theyâve devoted their lives. But I also know that underlying these concerns is a deeper worry, one that precedes not only this plan but this administration.Â  It stems from the sense that people in Washington -- driven sometimes less by vision than by politics -- have for years neglected NASAâs mission and undermined the work of the professionals who fulfill it.Â  Weâve seen that in the NASA budget, which has risen and fallen with the political winds. But we can also see it in other ways:Â  in the reluctance of those who hold office to set clear, achievable objectives; to provide the resources to meet those objectives; and to justify not just these plans but the larger purpose of space exploration in the 21st century. All that has to change.Â  And with the strategy Iâm outlining today, it will.Â  We start by increasing NASAâs budget by $6 billion over the next five years, even -- I want people to understand the context of this.Â  This is happening even as we have instituted a freeze on discretionary spending and sought to make cuts elsewhere in the budget. So NASA, from the start, several months ago when I issued my budget, was one of the areas where we didnât just maintain a freeze but we actually increased funding by $6 billion.Â  By doing that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system, including a probe of the Sunâs atmosphere; new scouting missions to Mars and other destinations; and an advanced telescope to follow Hubble, allowing us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before. We will increase Earth-based observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world -- science that will garner tangible benefits, helping us to protect our environment for future generations. And we will extend the life of the International Space Station likely by more than five years, while actually using it for its intended purpose:Â  conducting advanced research that can help improve the daily lives of people here on Earth, as well as testing and improving upon our capabilities in space.Â  This includes technologies like more efficient life support systems that will help reduce the cost of future missions.Â  And in order to reach the space station, we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable. Now, I recognize that some have said it is unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in this way.Â  I disagree.Â  The truth is, NASA has always relied on private industry to help design and build the vehicles that carry astronauts to space, from the Mercury capsule that carried John Glenn into orbit nearly 50 years ago, to the space shuttle Discovery currently orbiting overhead.Â  By buying the services of space transportation -- rather than the vehicles themselves -- we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standards are met.Â  But we will also accelerate the pace of innovations as companies -- from young startups to established leaders -- compete to design and build and launch new means of carrying people and materials out of our atmosphere. In addition, as part of this effort, we will build on the good work already done on the Orion crew capsule.Â  Iâve directed Charlie Bolden to immediately begin developing a rescue vehicle using this technology, so we are not forced to rely on foreign providers if it becomes necessary to quickly bring our people home from the International Space Station.Â  And this Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions.Â  In fact, Orion will be readied for flight right here in this room. Next, we will invest more than $3 billion to conduct research on an advanced âheavy lift rocketâ -- a vehicle to efficiently send into orbit the crew capsules, propulsion systems, and large quantities of supplies needed to reach deep space.Â  In developing this new vehicle, we will not only look at revising or modifying older models; we want to look at new designs, new materials, new technologies that will transform not just where we can go but what we can do when we get there.Â  And we will finalize a rocket design no later than 2015 and then begin to build it.Â  And I want everybody to understand:Â  Thatâs at least two years earlier than previously planned -- and thatâs conservative, given that the previous program was behind schedule and over budget. At the same time, after decades of neglect, we will increase investment -- right away -- in other groundbreaking technologies that will allow astronauts to reach space sooner and more often, to travel farther and faster for less cost, and to live and work in space for longer periods of time more safely.Â  That means tackling major scientific and technological challenges.Â  How do we shield astronauts from radiation on longer missions?Â  How do we harness resources on distant worlds?Â  How do we supply spacecraft with energy needed for these far-reaching journeys?Â  These are questions that we can answer and will answer.Â  And these are the questions whose answers no doubt will reap untold benefits right here on Earth. So the point is what weâre looking for is not just to continue on the same path -- we want to leap into the future; we want major breakthroughs; a transformative agenda for NASA. Now, yes, pursuing this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy.Â  In part, this is because the old strategy -- including the Constellation program -- was not fulfilling its promise in many ways.Â  Thatâs not just my assessment; thatâs also the assessment of a panel of respected non-partisan experts charged with looking at these issues closely.Â  Now, despite this, some have had harsh words for the decisions weâve made, including some individuals who Iâve got enormous respect and admiration for. But what I hope is, is that everybody will take a look at what we are planning, consider the details of what weâve laid out, and see the merits as Iâve described them.Â  The bottom line is nobody is more committed to manned space flight, to human exploration of space than I am.Â  But weâve got to do it in a smart way, and we canât just keep on doing the same old things that weâve been doing and thinking that somehow is going to get us to where we want to go. Some have said, for instance, that this plan gives up our leadership in space by failing to produce plans within NASA to reach low Earth orbit, instead of relying on companies and other countries.Â  But we will actually reach space faster and more often under this new plan, in ways that will help us improve our technological capacity and lower our costs, which are both essential for the long-term sustainability of space flight.Â  In fact, through our plan, weâll be sending many more astronauts to space over the next decade. There are also those who criticized our decision to end parts of Constellation as one that will hinder space exploration below [sic] low Earth orbit.Â  But itâs precisely by investing in groundbreaking research and innovative companies that we will have the potential to rapidly transform our capabilities -- even as we build on the important work already completed, through projects like Orion, for future missions.Â  And unlike the previous program, we are setting a course with specific and achievable milestones. Early in the next decade, a set of crewed flights will test and prove the systems required for exploration beyond low Earth orbit.Â And by 2025, we expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the first-ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space.Â So weâll start -- weâll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history.Â  By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth.Â  And a landing on Mars will follow.Â  And I expect to be around to see it. But I want to repeat -- I want to repeat this:Â  Critical to deep space exploration will be the development of breakthrough propulsion systems and other advanced technologies.Â  So Iâm challenging NASA to break through these barriers.Â  And weâll give you the resources to break through these barriers.Â  And I know you will, with ingenuity and intensity, because thatâs what youâve always done. Now, I understand that some believe that we should attempt a return to the surface of the Moon first, as previously planned.Â  But I just have to say pretty bluntly here:Â  Weâve been there before.Â  Buzz has been there.Â  Thereâs a lot more of space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do.Â  So I believe itâs more important to ramp up our capabilities to reach -- and operate at -- a series of increasingly demanding targets, while advancing our technological capabilities with each step forward.Â  And thatâs what this strategy does.Â  And thatâs how we will ensure that our leadership in space is even stronger in this new century than it was in the last. Finally, I want to say a few words about jobs.Â  Suzanne pointed out to me that the last time I was here, I made a very clear promise that I would help in the transition into a new program to make sure that people who are already going through a tough time here in this region were helped.Â  And despite some reports to the contrary, my plan will add more than 2,500 jobs along the Space Coast in the next two years compared to the plan under the previous administration.Â  So I want to make that point. Weâre going to modernize the Kennedy Space Center, creating jobs as we upgrade launch facilities.Â  And thereâs potential for even more jobs as companies in Florida and across America compete to be part of a new space transportation industry.Â  And some of those industry leaders are here today.Â  This holds the promise of generating more than 10,000 jobs nationwide over the next few years.Â  And many of these jobs will be created right here in Florida because this is an area primed to lead in this competition. Now, itâs true -- there are Floridians who will see their work on the shuttle end as the program winds down.Â  This is based on a decision that was made six years ago, not six months ago, but that doesnât make it any less painful for families and communities affected as this decision becomes reality. So Iâm proposing -- in part because of strong lobbying by Bill and by Suzanne, as well as Charlie -- Iâm proposing a $40 million initiative led by a high-level team from the White House, NASA, and other agencies to develop a plan for regional economic growth and job creation.Â  And I expect this plan to reach my desk by August 15th.Â Itâs an effort that will help prepare this already skilled workforce for new opportunities in the space industry and beyond. So this is the next chapter that we can write together here at NASA.Â  We will partner with industry.Â  We will invest in cutting-edge research and technology.Â  We will set far-reaching milestones and provide the resources to reach those milestones.Â  And step by step, we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do. Fifty years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach.Â  Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite.Â  And in fulfilling this task, we will not only extend humanityâs reach in space -- we will strengthen Americaâs leadership here on Earth. Now, Iâll close by saying this.Â  I know that some Americans have asked a question thatâs particularly apt on Tax Day:Â  Why spend money on NASA at all?Â  Why spend money solving problems in space when we donât lack for problems to solve here on the ground?Â  And obviously our country is still reeling from the worst economic turmoil weâve known in generations.Â  We have massive structural deficits that have to be closed in the coming years. But you and I know this is a false choice.Â  We have to fix our economy.Â  We need to close our deficits.Â  But for pennies on the dollar, the space program has fueled jobs and entire industries.Â  For pennies on the dollar, the space program has improved our lives, advanced our society, strengthened our economy, and inspired generations of Americans.Â  And I have no doubt that NASA can continue to fulfill this role.Â But that is why -- but I want to say clearly to those of you who work for NASA, but to the entire community that has been so supportive of the space program in this area:Â  That is exactly why itâs so essential that we pursue a new course and that we revitalize NASA and its mission -- not just with dollars, but with clear aims and a larger purpose. Now, little more than 40 years ago, astronauts descended the nine-rung ladder of the lunar module called Eagle, and allowed their feet to touch the dusty surface of the Earthâs only Moon.Â  This was the culmination of a daring and perilous gambit -- of an endeavor that pushed the boundaries of our knowledge, of our technological prowess, of our very capacity as human beings to solve problems.Â  It wasnât just the greatest achievement in NASAâs history -- it was one of the greatest achievements in human history. And the question for us now is whether that was the beginning of something or the end of something.Â  I choose to believe it was only the beginning. So thank you.Â  God bless you.Â  And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.","After dominating space for a half century, the U.S. is mired in a political fight that threatens its leadership role and ambitions for manned exploration.

President Barack Obama travels Thursday to the Kennedy Space Center to try to salvage his plans to re-energize the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, but experts say U.S. manned space travel will likely be grounded for years longer than previously expected.

The Florida summit comes amid an escalating battle between the White House and Congress over the fastest and least expensive way to revitalize the space program. Mr. Obama has been pushing ambitious plans for start-up companies to ferry astronauts into space on private rockets. Congress, meanwhile, is bent on defending NASA's traditional rocket and spacecraft programs, which the Obama administration wants to kill.

The White House believes NASA's current projects are too expensive and will take too long to deliver. Mr. Obama is betting that private enterprise can fill the gap -- carrying astronauts and cargo to the space station -- until a resurgent NASA can deliver more advanced vehicles.

But lawmakers, industry officials and scientists say they fear that for the first time since the glory days of the Apollo moon landings, the U.S. will end up without a clear plan, destination and timetable for sending astronauts into the solar system.

At stake is more than national pride. Losing the lead in space has national-security and industrial consequences. Such industries as shipping, airlines and oil exploration depend on orbiting satellites to gather and send essential data. TV signals, cell phones, ATMs, some credit card machines and many Internet connections rely on space technology. Recent estimates peg global civilian and military spending on space and space-related technologies at more than $260 billion annually.

At the same time, the Pentagon views space as a frontier where foes will try to undermine U.S. security.

The importance of space has drawn the European Union and more countries into the race. Russia, China, India and Brazil all have, or are determined to create, robust space programs. By 2016, China aims to develop and test a heavy-lift booster capable of blasting five tons of cargo into orbit -- a timetable far more ambitious than anything on NASA's drawing board.

With retirement of the space shuttle in a few months, the U.S. was already facing the prospect of hitching rides on Russian spacecraft to reach the international space station.

Some experts say the current political fight could leave the U.S. with no way to blast astronauts deeper into space until close to 2020. Initial optimistic hopes of returning U.S. astronauts to the moon by the end of the decade could be delayed another ten years or more, these experts say.

Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to walk on the moon, Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan -- the last human to walk on the moon -- warned in an open letter this week that the president's plan ""destines our nation to become one of second- or even third-rate stature."" Buzz Aldrin, another icon of U.S. space travel, has supported the president's plan.

Burt Rutan, the aerospace engineer who was the first person to send a privately built and designed craft into space, warned that NASA could be crippled within a few years, allowing international rivals to take the lead.

The retirement of the space shuttle program initiated a chance to chart a new course for the U.S. space program, said experts, but instead triggered conflict that is as much political as technological.

Congress wants to save NASA's existing exploration program, called Constellation, which was expected to produce 25,000 jobs and more than $60 billion in contractor revenue over its lifetime.

As originally conceived, Constellation was a $100 billion project to take astronauts into orbit, and later to deploy next-generation rockets and landers to explore the moon and, eventually, pave the way for manned exploration of Mars.

The White House believes the Constellation program will take too long and that a fresh approach is required. Lawmakers say they are skeptical of the president's plan to entrust core functions of the space program to untested start-up companies.

NASA chief Charles Bolden, a former astronaut, said Mr. Obama's visit to Florida would persuade doubters that ""he is dedicated to exploration and human space flight"" and ""committed to a vibrant future"" for NASA.

The president also plans to provide details on a few concessions, such as retaining a small portion of the Constellation program, as well as announcing that workers who lose their jobs when the space shuttle retires will be eligible for retraining and other benefits, according to people familiar with the matter.

Those involved in talks over the future of the U.S. space program say the most likely outcome is a compromise that may satisfy politicians but probably won't provide enough funding for either program to get off the ground quickly. ""That just drags out the pain and slows everything down for a long time,"" said Brewster Shaw, head of Boeing Co.'s space-exploration division.

Mr. Obama, who often recounts watching NASA launches as a youngster perched on his grandfather's shoulders, says he hopes to lead the agency through a historic shift.

To chart a new course, he selected Mr. Bolden and Lori Garver, a former NASA policy official and proponent of commercial space travel, as advisers. Ms. Garver, now the No. 2 official at NASA, headed the administration's transition team for the agency.

One of the first things Ms. Garver said she did was to ""look under the hood"" of the Constellation program. She didn't like what she found. The program was years behind schedule and over budget, and she said she had doubts about its long-term viability.

Ms. Garver also played a big role in naming a presidential panel to assess NASA. Led by former Lockheed Martin Corp. Chairman Norman Augustine, the panel released a report in October that was critical of the agency. The study concluded that without a substantial infusion of new money and ideas, Constellation would wither and NASA would become increasingly irrelevant.

A group of administration officials, including White House science chief John Holdren and his chief of staff Jim Kohlenberger, set out to begin dismantling the Constellation project.

""The fact that we poured $9 billion into an un-executable program really isn't an excuse to pour another $50 billion into it and still not have an executable program,"" Mr. Kohlenberger said of the project. The money would be better used, he and his colleagues concluded, on commercial space transportation.

The White House aides envisioned a bevy of space taxis -- designed, built and operated by private enterprise -- that could take astronauts to and from the space station. This earth-to-orbit job would rely on young companies and relatively untested technologies.

Space Exploration Technologies Inc., started by 38-year-old PayPal founder Elon Musk, for example, only had about 40 employees in 2004. Its largest rocket is still waiting for its first test flight, but SpaceX has a good chance of ending up as a key part of NASA's plans to transport both astronauts and cargo to the space station. Another entrant is Orbital Sciences Corp, a midsize NASA supplier that hopes to parlay its commercial efforts into securing a prime contract for manned programs.

Big contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. would also play a role but wouldn't be as intensely involved.

Supporters say the president's approach would create thousands of high-tech jobs and game-changing technologies. It would also free up NASA to deal with more difficult, longer-term projects, such as developing powerful boosters and in-orbit refueling systems making it possible to reach distant planets.

But the administration failed to persuade lawmakers and didn't make it easy for its staff. Mr. Bolden said he didn't get final numbers from the White House about the impact of Constellation's proposed demise until hours before the budget was released in February. Only then, he said, did ""we really know what the budget was going to be.""

Hours after announcing that NASA was betting on a group of entrepreneurs to deliver pioneering technologies, Mr. Bolden said he felt more comfortable with the agency's traditional contractors. ""I would be lying,"" he acknowledged in an interview, ""if I said I don't have some greater comfort with a Boeing"" than a fledgling company.

Ms. Garver was also slow to disclose the proposed project cancellations to NASA's biggest suppliers, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Alliant Techsystems Inc.

Even the Florida summit sparked friction. White House aides initially encouraged lawmakers to organize the event, but then decided to do it themselves. Aides to Mr. Obama then promised to reserve tickets for any members of Congress who wanted to attend, according to legislators and staffers. But invitations were later limited, according to a White House email this week that blamed Democratic Congressional leaders and apologized for ""any misunderstanding.""
","KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. â Pointing to Mars and asteroids as destinations, President Obama on Thursday forcefully countered criticisms that he was trying to end the nationâs human spaceflight program.

This was the first time that the president had lent his personal political capital in an increasingly testy fight over the future of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

âThe bottom line is, nobody is more committed to manned spaceflight, to human exploration of space than I am,â he said in a speech to about 200 attendees of a White House-sponsored space conference here.

But he was unwavering in insisting that NASA must change in sending people into space. âWeâve got to do it in a smart way,â Mr. Obama said, âand we canât just keep on doing the same old things weâve been doing and thinking thatâs going to get us where we want to go.â

Instead of earlier vague assurances by Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, and other administration officials that NASA would eventually venture beyond Earth orbit, Mr. Obama gave dates and destinations for astronauts. But the goals would be achieved long after he leaves office: a visit to an asteroid after 2025, reaching Mars by the mid-2030s.

âStep by step, we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do,â Mr. Obama said. âIn short, 50 years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time.â

Mr. Obama noted that President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to land on the Moon in 1961 â the year the current president was born. But the plan Mr. Obama laid out for now through the 2030s was unlike the Kennedy vision: It was a call for private industry to innovate its way to Mars, rather than a call for a national effort to demonstrate American predominance.

Mr. Obamaâs budget request to Congress in February proposed a major shift for NASA: canceling the Constellation program, started five years ago to send astronauts back to the Moon, and turning to private companies for carrying astronauts to the International Space Station.

Strikingly, Mr. Obama used the speech to blame his predecessors for lacking leadership on space policy and the critics of his own plan for failing to recognize that times have changed. NASAâs budgets, he noted, have ârisen and fallen with the political winds.â That appeared to be a shot at President George W. Bush, who announced a new plan for NASA after the Columbia disaster and barely mentioned space policy again for the rest of his presidency. And he argued that turning to private entrepreneurs would result in more space flights and more astronauts in orbit than the space plan he inherited.

Some members of Congress, particularly those in states that are home to NASA centers working on Constellation, have objected to the change, and the speech did not sway those who have been most vociferously opposed.

âThereâs no concrete plan, no deadlines to make it happen,â said Representative Pete Olson, Republican of Texas, whose district includes the Johnson Space Center. âIt didnât change my opinion at all.â

Mr. Obamaâs speech contained few surprises as White House officials previewed it to reporters two days ago.

Among the small concessions to critics, Mr. Obama is now proposing to revive the Constellationâs Orion crew capsule as a stripped-down version to use as a lifeboat for the space station.

âThis Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions,â Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama promised $40 million to help retrain workers in and around the Kennedy Space Center who will lose their jobs when the space shuttles are retired. He also stated that NASA would start developing a heavy-lift rocket by 2015, a promise that presumes the presidentâs re-election in 2012.

The tweaks appear to reflect political calculations. Florida and its 27 electoral votes are a likely key battleground in the next presidential election. On board Air Force One with the president on the flight to the Kennedy Space Center were two Democratic members of Congress from Florida: Senator Bill Nelson and Representative Suzanne M. Kosmas, whose district includes the Kennedy Space Center.

Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who represents parts of Houston close to the Johnson Space Center, was one of the attendees. Mr. Olson, a Republican, did not receive an invitation to the conference.

Whether appeals for loyalty from Democrats would succeed in gaining Congressional support is unclear. NASA has traditionally received strong support from both political parties, and the opposition to Mr. Obamaâs plans has also been bipartisan.

Ms. Kosmas, for example, is a co-sponsor of a bill to extend operations of the space shuttles, and Mr. Nelson has pushed for continued work on Constellation rockets as precursors to a heavy-lift rocket.

âIâm encouraged,â Mr. Nelson said, although he said he would continue pushing to continue development of the Constellation rockets.

Reviving Orion could mollify Lockheed Martin executives upset over the proposed cancellation. The Orion work is done largely at the Johnson Space Center and at Lockheed Martin facilities in Boulder, Colo.

While using Orion as a space station lifeboat may be politically savvy, some space experts, particularly those associated with the Constellation program, said the economic and technical rationale for the decision eluded them. It would take about $8 billion to finish the development of the current incarnation of Orion; a simpler version would most likely still cost several billion dollars.

âIn the end, this seems like an expensive proposition that makes simply continuing to use the Russians for crew rescue look like a bargain,â Michael D. Griffin, the former NASA administrator who oversaw the creation of Constellation, wrote in an e-mail message.

Elon Musk, the chief executive of the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, cheered the presidentâs speech and policy. He said the Dragon capsule that his company is developing could also serve as a lifeboat, and its design would also allow six-month stays at the station.

19,19,2010-04-22-DeepwaterHorizon.txt,"Now, we just finished a meeting with Admiral Thad Allen, our national incident commander for this spill, as well as Coast Guard personnel who are leading the response to this crisis. And they gave me an update on our efforts to stop the BP oil spill and mitigate the damage.

By the way, I just want to point out, I was told there was drizzling out here. Is this Louisiana drizzle right here?

They gave me a sense of how this spill is moving. It is now about 9 miles off the coast of southeastern Louisiana. And by the way, we had the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal, as well as parish presidents who were taking part in this meeting because we want to emphasize the importance of coordinating between local, State, and Federal officials throughout this process.

Now, I think the American people are now aware--certainly, the folks down in the Gulf are aware--that we're dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster. The oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our Gulf States, and it could extend for a long time. It could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home.

And that's why the Federal Government has launched and coordinated an all-hands-on-deck, relentless response to this crisis from day one. After the explosion on the drilling rig, it began with an aggressive search and rescue effort to evacuate 115 people, including 3 badly injured. And my thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the 11 workers who have not yet--who have not been found.

When the drill unit sank on Thursday, we immediately and intensely investigated by remotely operated vehicles the entire 5,000 feet of pipe that's on the floor of the ocean. In that process, three leaks were identified, the most recent coming just last Wednesday evening. As Admiral Allen and Secretary Napolitano have made clear, we've made preparations from day one to stage equipment for a worst-case scenario. We immediately set up command center operations here in the Gulf and coordinated with all State and local governments. And the third breach was discovered on Wednesday.

We already had by that time in position more than 70 vessels and hundreds of thousands of feet of boom. And I dispatched the Secretaries of the Interior and Homeland Security, the Administrator of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, who is here, my Assistant for Energy and Climate Change Policy, and the Administrator of NOAA to the Gulf Coast to ensure that we are doing whatever is required to respond to this event.

So I want to emphasize, from day one we have prepared and planned for the worst, even as we hoped for the best. And while we have prepared and reacted aggressively, I'm not going to rest--and none of the gentlemen and women who are here are going to rest--or be satisfied until the leak is stopped at the source, the oil on the Gulf is contained and cleaned up, and the people of this region are able to go back to their lives and their livelihoods.

Now, currently, the most advanced technology available is being used to try and stop a leak that is more than 5,000 feet under the surface. Because this leak is unique and unprecedented, it could take many days to stop. And that's why we're also using every resource available to stop the oil from coming ashore and mitigating the damage it could cause. And much of the discussion here at the center was focused on if we and when we have to deal with these mitigation efforts. Thus far, as you can tell, the weather has not been as cooperative as we'd like on this front. But we're going to continue to push forward.

I also want to stress that we are working closely with the Gulf States and local communities to help every American affected by this crisis. So let me be clear: BP is responsible for this leak; BP will be paying the bill. But as President of the United States, I'm going to spare no effort to respond to this crisis for as long as it continues. And we will spare no resource to clean up whatever damage is caused. And while there will be time to fully investigate what happened on that rig and hold responsible parties accountable, our focus now is on a fully coordinated, relentless response effort to stop the leak and prevent more damage to the Gulf.

I want to thank the thousands of Americans who've been working around the clock to stop this crisis, whether it's the brave men and women of our military or the local officials who call the Gulf home. They are doing everything in their power to mitigate this disaster, prevent damage to our environment, and help our fellow citizens.

And during this visit, I am hoping to have the opportunity to speak with some of the individuals who are directly affected by the disaster. I've heard already that people are, understandably, frustrated and frightened, especially because the people of this region have been through worse disasters than anybody should have to bear. But every American affected by this spill should know this: Your Government will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to stop this crisis.

This is one of the richest and most beautiful ecosystems on the planet, and for centuries, its residents have enjoyed and made a living off the fish that swim in these waters and the wildlife that inhabit these shores. This is also the heartbeat of the region's economic life. And we're going to do everything in our power to protect our natural resources, compensate those who have been harmed, rebuild what has been damaged, and help this region persevere like it has done so many times before. That's a commitment I'm making as President of the United States, and I know that everybody who works for the Federal Government feels the exact same way.

Thank you very much, everybody.
","A massive fire on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico left 11 workers missing and cast a pall over an offshore drilling boom that stands to dramatically lift U.S. energy output.

Rescuers scoured the Gulf for the unaccounted workers late Wednesday as firefighters struggled to quench a towering fire that forced all aboard to flee.

The blaze on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which broke out around 10 p.m. central Tuesday night, thrust a geyser of flames and smoke into the sky about 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana. Seventeen people were injured, three critically, rescue officials said.

The rig is operated for oil giant BP PLC by drilling contractor Transocean Ltd., which said the search for the cause of the fire would begin after the missing had been accounted for. But Transocean said one possibility that might explain the size and ferocity of the blaze is a blow-out, an uncontrolled burst of oil and natural gas from the well.

Some industry analysts said they feared the accident might temporarily damp the pace of oil development in the deepest reaches of the Gulf, which has become a significant exploration hotspot for international oil companies seeking new sources of petroleum. The industry is booming, and has been challenged by a tight supply of rigs and skilled workers.

The accident comes at a sensitive time politically for the industry. President Obama late last month proposed allowing drilling in new areas of the eastern Gulf of Mexico and off the southern Atlantic coast, where it was banned. Supporters argue the industry has become much safer. The Transocean fire could be an untimely reminder of risks.

""Is there a domino effect from this?"" asked Arun Jayaram, a Credit Suisse analyst. ""It seems like there would be some collateral damage.""

The incident could spark calls for increased regulation, said Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a consulting firm. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group, put out a statement Wednesday standing by its safety record.

""Every incident is both one too many and a powerful incentive to improve training, operational procedures, regulations, industry standards and technology,"" the statement said.

The rig, which analysts said would cost $600 million to replace, was listing badly Wednesday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. A so-called semi-submersible, the rig is a nearly 400-foot-long floating platform that uses thrusters to hold it in place above a well. Transocean is the world's largest offshore drilling contractor, with more than 21,000 workers and 140 rigs, many of them state-of-the-art vessels.

BP says it had just wrapped up exploratory drilling at the Deepwater Horizon's site and was in the process of analyzing the results at the well, which extends through 4,992 feet of water and another 13,000 feet under the seabed. BP, along with U.S. companies such as Chevron Corp., has announced significant oil fields in recent years.

Months of wrangling may ensue over responsibility for the fire. Transocean was largely in control of the drilling; BP had representatives aboard the rig who would have given instructions on where and how the contractor should drill.

Transocean executive Adrian Rose said at a press conference in New Orleans: ""We are deeply saddened by this event."" Company spokesman Guy Cantwell declined to comment on the rig's safety record.

Still, the fire may bring renewed public scrutiny to BP, as the incident comes five years after the explosion and fire at its refinery in Texas City, Tex., which killed 15 people.

BP says it stands ready to help with the investigation. It says has invested more than $1 billion to fix problems at Texas City, part of a multi-year program emphasizing safety.

In recent years, oil companies have pushed further offshore in search of oil, as older, easier oilfields dry up and foreign governments cut access to reserves.

The emphasis on deepwater exploration has led to a surge in construction of rigs capable of drilling in such depths. The number of deepwater rigs -- capable of drilling in 3,000 feet of water or more -- has grown 43% since 2006, according to research firm ODS-Petrodata.

The boom in rigs has strained contractors, which have struggled to find experienced workers to run them.

Big companies such as Transocean have had to move workers onto newly built rigs, while also fending off new, smaller companies looking to hire away veteran crews.

Transocean has grown especially fast. In 2007 it merged with rival GlobalSantaFe in an $18 billion deal. Integrating the two companies has been a challenge, said Doug Sheridan, managing director of EnergyPoint Research, a firm that rates drillers and other oil service companies based on interviews with their customers.

Mr. Sheridan said Transocean's safety ratings have remained strong since the merger. But he added, ""You have to ask the question, 'Have we been stretched thin? Did something fall through the cracks?'""

Transocean spokesman Greg Panagos dismissed such concerns. He said the company is a ""very safety conscious organization. It's the top priority in the company.""

Deepwater Horizon was one of five Transocean ships given safety awards by the U.S. Minerals Management Services last year.

There were spots on its record. It partially flooded in May 2008 and began to list, after a worker accidentally opened a valve that let in seawater, federal records show. No injuries were reported. The rig had a small fire in 2005. No one was injured.

There were at least three rig fires in the Gulf this year before the Horizon incident and 14 last year, including several that forced crew members to evacuate, according to data from the Minerals Management Service.

Major fires, in which oil and gas catch fire, are rarer. In 2001, a big platform tipped over and caught fire off Brazil, killing 11.

The oil markets didn't react strongly to the news, falling 17 cents in futures trading to close at $83.68 a barrel. The fire occurred at a long-term BP prospect called Macondo, not an existing producing oilfield.

Deepwater wells have become important for companies such as BP as well as for the broader oil supply. The Gulf of Mexico produces more than 1.6 million barrels a day, about 30% of U.S. oil output, federal data show.

Production from the Gulf has fallen recently as early, shallow-water discoveries have begun to dry up.

But new, deepwater drilling has begun to reverse that trend. Gulf output was on track to rise last year for the first time since 2006, preliminary data from the Energy Information Administration show.
","NEW ORLEANS â An explosion on an oil drilling rig off the coast of southeast Louisiana left at least 3 people critically injured and 11 others missing as of Wednesday night.

Rescue teams were searching the area in the Gulf of Mexico by helicopter, plane and boat, Coast Guard officials said.

âWe have no idea where the 11 unaccounted-for personnel are at this time,â Rear Adm. Mary Landry, the commander of the Coast Guardâs Eighth District, said at a news conference.

The explosion occurred Tuesday night, and on Wednesday afternoon crews were still fighting the fire, which was largely contained to the rig but in photographs provided by the Coast Guard appeared to be shooting enormous plumes of flame into the air. Admiral Landry estimated that 13,000 gallons of crude were pouring out per hour.

Officials said the pollution was considered minimal so far because most of the oil and gas was being burned up in the fire. âBut that does have the potential to change,â said David Rainey, the vice president in charge of the Gulf of Mexico exploration for BP, which is leasing the rig.

Seven oil-spill response vessels were en route to forestall any spreading of the oil in the ocean, Mr. Rainey said.

The rig was taking on water from the firefighting efforts, causing it to list up to 10 degrees, but company officials said they did not expect it to collapse. Firefighting crews intended to use a remote-controlled vehicle to plug the well and cut off the fuel for the fire, but it is unclear how long such an operation would take.

Seventeen crew workers were injured, three of them critically, and were taken to hospitals in the region, said Adrian Rose, an executive for Transocean, the company that owns the rig. The injuries included burns, smoke inhalation and broken legs. At least eight people were treated and released from hospitals.

It was unclear what caused the explosion.

âWeâve had hurricanes and fires on the rigs, but I canât remember that we ever had this type of explosion and definitely not on this type of rig,â said Billy Nungesser, the president of nearby Plaquemines Parish, where some oil rig workers live. âThis is one of the largest, deep water, off-shore drilling rigs.â

Officials from the Minerals Management Service, a bureau of the Department of Interior, were assembling an investigation team and planned to interview the crew members â those who were unscathed or sustained only minor injuries, said Deputy Secretary David Hayes of the Interior Department. Those workers were being transported to Port Fourchon on Wednesday night.

Mr. Hayes said the Minerals Management Service had performed three inspections of the rig this year, including one in the past month, and found no cause for concern.

The explosion occurred at about 10 p.m. Central time on Tuesday night, and came without warning, Mr. Rose said.

âThis would have happened very, very rapidly,â he said.

Most of the 126-person crew was able to evacuate onto lifeboats; some were picked up by other offshore vessels in the area. Most of the crew worked for Transocean, though a small team of Transocean and BP executives had flown out to the rig before the explosion. Officials said about 40 of the people on the rig worked for different companies.

The oil drilling rig, called Deepwater Horizon, is positioned about 50 miles southeast of Venice, La., in water nearly 5,000 feet deep. Transocean, a Swiss-based company, said the rig, one of the largest and most sophisticated in the world, has been under contract to BP since September 2007.

It is a drilling rig, and was not producing any oil. The rig had drilled a well in the sea floor and was in one of the last phases of the operation, building a cement casing to reinforce the well.

This can be a delicate phase given the potential for an uncontrolled gas release that could lead to what is called a blowout. Mr. Rose said it was too early to say that this is what happened, but that it was a possibility.

The Deepwater Horizon can operate in water depths up to 8,000 feet, according to Transoceanâs Web site. It is 396 feet long and 256 feet wide and was built in 2001 by Hyundai Heavy Industries Shipyard in South Korea.

âItâs been generating substantial day rates, in the neighborhood of $500,000 a day,â said Greg Panagos, a spokesman for Transocean.

Local officials had said earlier Wednesday that the missing crew workers had been found. But that report, along with one that they had been seen at one point in a life raft that had since been lost, turned out to be untrue.

âIâve been an analyst since 1999 and I canât recall another incident like this one,"" said Robert MacKenzie, managing director of the energy and natural resources group of FBR Capital Markets. ""There are rigs that burn down, but itâs usually during the drilling process and not when the rig is close to finishing the well.â

20,20,2010-05-07-StockSelloff.txt,"All right. Good morning, everybody. On what seems like a daily basis, we're barraged with statistics and forecasts and reports and data related to the health of the economy. But from the first days of this administration, amidst the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, I've said that the truest measure of progress would be whether or not we were creating jobs. That's what matters in people's lives. What matters is whether someone who needs a job can find work, whether people can provide for their families and save for the future and achieve some measure of economic security.

Everything we've done has been with this goal in mind. And today I'm happy to report that we received some very encouraging news. In April, the economy added 290,000 jobs, with the vast majority, approximately 230,000, coming from the private sector. This is the largest monthly increase in 4 years. And we created 121,000 more jobs in February and March than previously estimated, which means we've now seen job growth for 4 months in a row.

These numbers are particularly heartening when you consider where we were a year ago, with an economy in freefall. At the height of the downturn, around the time that I took office, we were losing an average of 750,000 jobs per month.

So this news comes on the heels of a report last week that the overall output of our economy, our GDP, is increasing. We now know that the economy has been growing for the better part of a year. And this steady growth is starting to give businesses the confidence to expand and to hire new people.

I should also note that the unemployment rate ticked up slightly from 9.7 to 9.9. Given the strength of these job numbers, this may seem contradictory, but this increase is largely a reflection of the fact that workers who had dropped out of the workforce entirely are now seeing jobs again and--are now seeking jobs again, encouraged by better prospects.

Now, I want to emphasize, the economic crisis we've faced has inflicted a lot of damage on families and businesses across our country, and it's going to take time to repair and rebuild. Over the course of this recession, more than 8 million jobs were lost. So there are a lot of people out there who are still experiencing real hardship. And we've got to be mindful that today's job numbers, while welcome, leave us with a lot of work to do. It's going to take time to achieve the strong and sustained job growth that is necessary. And of course, long before this recession hit, for a decade, middle class families had been experiencing a sense of declining economic security.

So yes, we've got a ways to go. But we've also come a very long way. And we can see that the difficult and, at times, unpopular steps that we've taken over the past year are making a difference. Productivity is up. The hours people are working are up. Both are signs the company may be hiring more workers in the months to come. We saw the largest increase in manufacturing employment since 1998. And we can see the benefits of our Recovery Act in the strong employment reports from construction and other sectors, where we've made key investments in creating and saving jobs.

Of course, there are limits to what the Government can do. The true engine of job growth in this country will always be the private sector. That's why we are very pleased to see the strong employment growth on the private sector side.

What Government can do is help create the conditions for companies to hire again. What it can do is build the infrastructure and offer the incentives that will allow small businesses to add workers, that will help entrepreneurs take a chance on an idea, that will lead manufacturers to set up shop not overseas, but right here in United States of America.

And that's what we've been doing. Right now a series of tax incentives and other steps to promote hiring are taking effect. Because of a bill I signed into law a few weeks ago, businesses are now eligible for tax cuts for hiring unemployed workers. Companies are also able to write off more of their investments in new equipment. And we're spurring additional investments in school renovation, clean energy projects, and road construction, which will create jobs while laying a new foundation for lasting growth.

In addition, as part of health reform, 4 million small businesses recently received a postcard in their mailbox telling them that they're eligible for a health care tax cut this year. It's worth perhaps tens of thousands of dollars to each of these companies, and it will provide welcome relief to small-business owners, who too often have to choose between health care and hiring.

So that's what's already come on line. But we still have more to do. In my State of the Union Address, I called for a $30 billion small-business lending fund, which would help increase the flow of credit to small companies that were hit hard by the decline in lending that followed the financial crisis. And, obviously, small businesses are a major source of job creation.

This morning we sent draft legislation to Congress on this fund, which now includes a new State small-business credit initiative. This State initiative, which was designed with the help of Governors and Members of both the House and the Senate, will help expand lending for small businesses and manufacturers at a time when budget shortfalls are leading States to cut back on vitally important lending programs.

In addition, with State and local governments facing huge budget gaps, we're seeing layoffs of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other essential public servants, which not only harms the economy, but also the community and the economy as a whole. So we are working with Congress to find ways to keep our teachers in the classrooms, the police officers on the beat, and firefighters on call.

A few months ago, I also proposed giving people rebates to upgrade the energy efficiencies of their home. This will not only save families money, it will create jobs in hard-hit construction and manufacturing sectors, since things like windows and insulation are overwhelmingly made in the United States of America. I was gratified to see a bipartisan vote to pass this proposal, called Home Star, in the House of Representatives yesterday. I'm calling on the Senate to act as well. And I'm urging Congress to expand the clean energy manufacturing tax credit, which is helping create jobs across America building wind turbines and solar panels.

Even as we take these steps to increase hiring in the short and long run, we're also mindful of other economic factors that can emerge. So I want to speak to the unusual market activity that took place yesterday on Wall Street. The regulatory authorities are evaluating this closely, with a concern for protecting investors and preventing this from happening again. And they will make findings of their review public, along with recommendations for appropriate action.

I also spoke this morning with German Chancellor Merkel regarding economic and financial developments in Europe. We agreed on the importance of a strong policy response by the affected countries and a strong financial response from the international community. I made clear that the United States supports these efforts and will continue to cooperate with European authorities and the IMF during this critical period.

So this week's job numbers come as a relief to Americans who found a job, but it offers, obviously, little comfort to those who are still out of work. So to those who are out there still looking, I give you my word that I'm going to keep fighting every single day to create jobs and opportunities for people. Every one of my team that's standing alongside me here has the same sense of mission. We're not going to rest until we've put this difficult chapter behind us. And I won't rest until you, and millions of your neighbors caught up in these storms, are able to find a good job and reach a brighter day.

Thank you very much, everybody.

","The stock market plunged Thursday in a harrowing five-minute selloff that appeared to be triggered by a breakdown of trading systems. After dropping nearly 1,000 points, the market rebounded but still closed down 3.2%, leaving Wall Street struggling to figure out what happened.

Investors already were jittery about the ripple effects of the crisis in Greece when the market went into free fall at 2:42 p.m. By 2:47, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had crossed 10000 in the biggest intraday point drop in its history. By 3:07, the market had regained 500 points, ultimately staggering to a close at 10520.32, down 347.80 points.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said they were working with other regulators to review ""unusual trading activity."" The major U.S. stock exchanges said they were looking for trading glitches and examining potentially erroneous trades in multiple stocks. Major exchanges said they will cancel erroneous trades that occurred during the selloff.

Multiple stocks, ranging from Accenture PLC to Boston Beer Co., momentarily lost nearly 100% of their value, changing hands for just one penny. Exchange-traded funds, which are index funds that trade like stocks on exchanges, were also temporarily vaporized. The $9.5 billion iShares Russell 1000 Value Index Fund went from $59 to around 8 cents in the blink of an eye.

""It happened so quickly, it was like a torpedo,"" said Scott Redler, chief strategic officer at T3 Capital Management, a hedge fund. ""It was mayhem.""

Unnerved traders frantically searched for an explanation, scouring the trade blotters for clues to the cause. Many pinned the blame on an erroneous trade for a basket of stocks which caused shares for companies such as Procter & Gamble Co., one of the market's most stable blue-chip stocks, to fall 35% in two minutes.

The market was already down some 500 points when the selloff began. Televisions showed images of standoffs between Greek police and protesters, and the European Central Bank declined to step up its effort to stabilize government debt markets.

Traders immediately said a market glitch must have contributed to the decline. They theorized that high-frequency trading firms, which use computer programs to trade and account for about two-thirds of the market's overall volume, might have contributed to the speed of the decline, although they offered no specifics.

Several high-frequency firms, including Tradebot Systems Inc., which says it often accounts for 5% of the U.S. market's volume, stopped trading when the market grew volatile. With these traders on the sidelines, there were fewer potential buyers, which may have contributed to the plunge.
","A bad day in the stock market turned into one of the most terrifying moments in Wall Street history on Thursday with a brief 1,000-point plunge that recalled the panic of 2008.

It lasted just 16 minutes but left Wall Street experts and ordinary investors alike struggling to come to grips with what had happened â and fearful of where the markets might go from here.

At least part of the sell-off appeared to be linked to trader error, perhaps an incorrect order routed through one of the nationâs exchanges. Many of those trades may be reversed so investors do not lose money on questionable transactions.

But the speed and scale of the plunge â the largest intraday decline on record â seemed to feed fears that the financial troubles gripping Europe were at last reaching across the Atlantic. Amid the rout, new signs of stress emerged in the credit markets. European banks seemed to be growing wary of lending to each other, suggesting the debt crisis was entering a more dangerous phase.

Traders and Washington policy makers struggled to keep up as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,000 points shortly after 2:30 p.m. and then mostly rebounded in a matter of minutes. For a moment, the sell-off seemed to overwhelm computer and human systems alike, and some traders began referring grimly to the day as âBlack Thursday.â

But in the end, Thursday was not as black as it had seemed. After briefly sinking below 10,000, the Dow ended down 347.80, or 3.2 percent, at 10,520.32. The Standard & Poorâs 500-stock index dropped 37.75 points, or 3.24 percent, to close at 1,128.15, and the Nasdaq was down 82.65 points, or 3.44 percent, at 2,319.64.

But up and down Wall Street, and across the nation, many investors were dumbstruck. Experts groped for explanations as blue-chip stocks like Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris and Accenture plunged. At one point, Accenture fell more than 90 percent to a penny. P.& G. plunged to $39.37 from more than $60 within minutes.

The crisis in Greece, high-speed computer program trading, the debate over regulatory reform in Washington, talk of errant trades â all were pointed to as possible catalysts. But most agreed the plunge would not have been as bad had the markets not already been on edge over the debt crisis in Europe.

âThere is a recognition that the Greek crisis has morphed into not only a European crisis but is going global,â said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, the money manager.

Daily business updates  The latest coverage of business, markets and the economy, sent by email each weekday.

On the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, traders shouted or watched open-mouthed as the screens lighted up with plummeting prices and as phones rang off the hook. âIt was almost like âThe Twilight Zone.â â said Theodore R. Aronson of Aronson, Johnson & Ortiz, a money management firm in Philadelphia.

Wall Street managers wandered their trading floors, trying to calm their people and figure out what was going on. They began to notice wild movements in stocks like P.& G. and Philip Morris. Many traders said computer program trades accelerated the slide as market indexes fell through crucial levels.

In Washington, Treasury officials began combing market tapes for answers. By the evening they still had not gotten to the bottom of it, but they discovered some aberrations â market blips â in trading coming out of Chicago.

The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, was returning to the Treasury about 2 p.m. from the Capitol when he saw on his BlackBerry that the market was down 3 percent. He called the Treasuryâs market room, which constantly monitors financial exchanges; officials there theorized that the cause was Greeceâs and Europeâs financial woes.

Minutes later in the Treasury hallway, Mr. Geithner looked again at his BlackBerry and saw that the market was down nearly 9 percent. He told colleagues it had to be a mistake.

Mr. Geithner immediately called the market room and then the Federal Reserve. He held a conference call with Fed officials and Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. About 3:15, Mr. Geithner walked to the Oval Office to brief President Obama.

Next Mr. Geithner spoke with European central bankers. After the markets closed, at 4:15 and again at 5:45, he joined conference calls with the heads of the Fed, the New York Fed, the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; the calls were expected to continue into the evening.

The Group of 7 industrial nationsâ ministers and governors, including Mr. Geithner, plan a conference call at 7:30 a.m. Friday Eastern time.

As of about 6 p.m., all the officials knew was that there had been what one called âa huge, anomalous, unexplained surge in selling, it looks like in Chicago, at about 2:45.â The source remained unknown, but it had apparently set off algorithmic trading strategies, which in turn rippled across everything, pushing trading out of whack and feeding on itself â until it started to reverse.

Federal officials fielded rumors that the culprit was a single stock, a single institution or execution system, a $16 billion trade that should have been $16 million. But they did not know the truth.

What happens to the dayâs market losers will depend on the nature of the cause and whether it can be identified. That is a question for the S.E.C. The Nasdaq market said in the evening that it would cancel all trades in hundreds of stocks whose prices had swung wildly between 2:40 p.m. and 3 p.m.

As Wall Street reeled, anchors on CNBC, Bloomberg and the Fox Business Network turned their attention to the Dow.

When the Dow was down more than 900 points and the CNBC anchor Erin Burnett observed that the P.& G. stock had dropped 25 percent, Jim Cramer, the former hedge fund trader and the host of âMad Money,â seemed to calm the conversation a bit by basically saying, âBuy, buy, buy.â

âIf that stock is there, you just go and buy it,â he said of P.& G. âThat is not a real price. Just go buy Procter & Gamble.â

The dayâs uncertainty pushed the euro to its lowest level against the dollar in 14 months. It slipped to $1.2529 at one point before closing at $1.2602. The dollarâs rise, and the mounting fear of a slowdown in global growth, sent commodities prices lower. Crude oil fell $2.86 to settle at $77.16 a barrel.

By the close, when calm was restored, the focus was on working out what had happened.

The S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said they were reviewing âunusual trading activity.â But already markets were turning attention back to Europe â whether German lawmakers would approve the Greek bailout on Friday, whether warning signals would flash brighter, whether the euro zone would stay together, or whether this was a precursor of more gyrations to come.

21,21,2010-07-15-DeepwaterCapped.txt,"Good evening.  As we speak, our nation faces a multitude of challenges.  At home, our top priority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched the lives of nearly every American.  Abroad, our brave men and women in uniform are taking the fight to al Qaeda wherever it exists.  And tonight, Iâve returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast to speak with you about the battle weâre waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens.

On April 20th, an explosion ripped through BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, about 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana.  Eleven workers lost their lives.  Seventeen others were injured.  And soon, nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean, oil began spewing into the water.

Because there has never been a leak this size at this depth, stopping it has tested the limits of human technology.  Thatâs why just after the rig sank, I assembled a team of our nationâs best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge -- a team led by Dr. Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and our nationâs Secretary of Energy.  Scientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies have also provided ideas and advice.

As a result of these efforts, weâve directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology.  And in the coming weeks and days, these efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the oil leaking out of the well.  This is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer thatâs expected to stop the leak completely.

Already, this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced.  And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane, itâs not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days.  The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic, one that we will be fighting for months and even years.

But make no mistake:  We will fight this spill with everything weâve got for as long as it takes.  We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused.  And we will do whateverâs necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy.

Tonight Iâd like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward:  what weâre doing to clean up the oil, what weâre doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf, and what weâre doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again.

First, the cleanup.  From the very beginning of this crisis, the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nationâs history -- an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen, who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters.  We now have nearly 30,000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil.  Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf.  And Iâve authorized the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard members along the coast.  These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore, theyâre ready to help clean the beaches, train response workers, or even help with processing claims -- and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible.

Because of our efforts, millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning, skimming and other collection methods.  Over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil.  Weâve approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reaches the shore, and weâre working with Alabama, Mississippi and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines.

As the cleanup continues, we will offer whatever additional resources and assistance our coastal states may need.  Now, a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect, and new challenges will always arise.  I saw and heard evidence of that during this trip.  So if something isnât working, we want to hear about it.  If there are problems in the operation, we will fix them.

But we have to recognize that despite our best efforts, oil has already caused damage to our coastline and its wildlife.  And sadly, no matter how effective our response is, there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done.  Thatâs why the second thing weâre focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast.

You know, for generations, men and women who call this region home have made their living from the water.  That living is now in jeopardy.  Iâve talked to shrimpers and fishermen who donât know how theyâre going to support their families this year.  Iâve seen empty docks and restaurants with fewer customers -- even in areas where the beaches are not yet affected.  Iâve talked to owners of shops and hotels who wonder when the tourists might start coming back.  The sadness and the anger they feel is not just about the money theyâve lost.  Itâs about a wrenching anxiety that their way of life may be lost.

I refuse to let that happen.  Tomorrow, I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his companyâs recklessness.  And this fund will not be controlled by BP.  In order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner, the account must and will be administered by an independent third party.

Beyond compensating the people of the Gulf in the short term, itâs also clear we need a long-term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region.  The oil spill represents just the latest blow to a place thatâs already suffered multiple economic disasters and decades of environmental degradation that has led to disappearing wetlands and habitats.  And the region still hasnât recovered from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Thatâs why we must make a commitment to the Gulf Coast that goes beyond responding to the crisis of the moment.

I make that commitment tonight.  Earlier, I asked Ray Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy, who is also a former governor of Mississippi and a son of the Gulf Coast, to develop a long-term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible.  The plan will be designed by states, local communities, tribes, fishermen, businesses, conservationists and other Gulf residents.  And BP will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region.

The third part of our response plan is the steps weâre taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again.  A few months ago, I approved a proposal to consider new, limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe -- that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken.

That obviously was not the case in the Deepwater Horizon rig, and I want to know why.  The American people deserve to know why.  The families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion -- these families deserve to know why.  And so Iâve established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place.  Already, Iâve issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling.  I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs, but for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue.  And while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible, I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially.

One place weâve already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits, known as the Minerals Management Service.  Over the last decade, this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility -- a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves.  At this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight.  Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations.

When Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior, one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency.  But itâs now clear that the problem there ran much deeper, and the pace of reform was just too slow.  And so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency -- Michael Bromwich, who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General.  And his charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industryâs watchdog -- not its partner.

So one of the lessons weâve learned from this spill is that we need better regulations, better safety standards, and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling.  But a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry, drilling for oil these days entails greater risk.  After all, oil is a finite resource.  We consume more than 20 percent of the worldâs oil, but have less than 2 percent of the worldâs oil reserves.  And thatâs part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean -- because weâre running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water.

For decades, we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered.  For decades, weâve talked and talked about the need to end Americaâs century-long addiction to fossil fuels.  And for decades, we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires.  Time and again, the path forward has been blocked -- not only by oil industry lobbyists, but also by a lack of political courage and candor.

The consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight.  Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be right here in America.  Each day, we send nearly $1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil.  And today, as we look to the Gulf, we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude.

We cannot consign our children to this future.  The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now.  Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash Americaâs innovation and seize control of our own destiny.

This is not some distant vision for America.  The transition away from fossil fuels is going to take some time, but over the last year and a half, weâve already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry.  As we speak, old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines, people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows, and small businesses are making solar panels.  Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks, and families are making their homes more energy-efficient.  Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries.

Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us.  As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs -- but only if we accelerate that transition.  Only if we seize the moment.  And only if we rally together and act as one nation -- workers and entrepreneurs; scientists and citizens; the public and private sectors.

When I was a candidate for this office, I laid out a set of principles that would move our country towards energy independence.  Last year, the House of Representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill -- a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for Americaâs businesses.

Now, there are costs associated with this transition.  And there are some who believe that we canât afford those costs right now.  I say we canât afford not to change how we produce and use energy --because the long-term costs to our economy, our national security, and our environment are far greater.

So Iâm happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party -- as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels.  Some have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks.  Some believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power.  Others wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high-tech industry does on research and development -- and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development.

All of these approaches have merit, and deserve a fair hearing in the months ahead.  But the one approach I will not accept is inaction.  The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is somehow too big and too difficult to meet.  You know, the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War II.  The same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon.  And yet, time and again, we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom.  Instead, what has defined us as a nation since our founding is the capacity to shape our destiny -- our determination to fight for the America we want for our children.  Even if weâre unsure exactly what that looks like.  Even if we donât yet know precisely how weâre going to get there.  We know weâll get there.

Itâs a faith in the future that sustains us as a people.  It is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the Gulf right now.

Each year, at the beginning of shrimping season, the regionâs fishermen take part in a tradition that was brought to America long ago by fishing immigrants from Europe.  Itâs called âThe Blessing of the Fleet,â and today itâs a celebration where clergy from different religions gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the men and women who will soon head out to sea -- some for weeks at a time. The ceremony goes on in good times and in bad.  It took place after Katrina, and it took place a few weeks ago -- at the beginning of the most difficult season these fishermen have ever faced.

And still, they came and they prayed.  For as a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition, âThe blessing is not that God has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers.  The blessing is that He is with us always,â a blessing thatâs granted âeven in the midst of the storm.â

The oil spill is not the last crisis America will face.  This nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again.  What sees us through -- what has always seen us through -- is our strength, our resilience, and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it.

Tonight, we pray for that courage.  We pray for the people of the Gulf.  And we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day.

Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.
","Oil stopped flowing into the Gulf of Mexico from BP PLC's blown-out well for the first time in nearly three months. But BP and U.S. officials warned it was far too early to declare victory.

BP said Thursday afternoon it shut the valves on a new cap on the well as it tested its latest effort to contain the massive spill.

That temporarily stopped the surge of crude oil that has fouled a wide swath of the Gulf from Texas to Florida, upended domestic politics in the U.S. and raised the prospect that the oil industry will face significant new government curbs on its activities on and offshore.

The test could take up to 48 hours to complete. If the results are ideal, the cap could be used to stop the flow from the well while work resumes on efforts to plug it permanently. More likely, a successful test will enable BP to siphon all the oil from the well to ships on the surface in a controlled manner, eliminating leaks until a permanent fix is made.

Although BP has managed to temporarily halt the undersea gusher, company and federal officials insist there is only one permanent solution to the disaster: A relief well that will tap into the shaft of the blown-out well and allow BP to pour heavy drilling fluid and cement into the oil reservoir, 19,000 feet below the water's surface, to kill the leak for good.

BP has said the relief well could be finished by the end of July. U.S. officials have stuck to an estimate of mid-August.

BP and federal officials sought Thursday to avoid appearing too optimistic, in light of setbacks to earlier efforts to stop the flow. President Barack Obama on Thursday called the progress a positive sign, but cautioned: ""We're still in the testing phase.""""

BP said the undersea cameras trained on the well head could likely show oil flowing again during the testing.

""What I'm trying to do is maintain my emotions remembering this is the start of our test,"" Kent Wells, a BP senior vice president, said Thursday. ""I don't want to sort of create a false sense of excitement.""

Still, BP's shares jumped on the news. Its American depositary shares closed Thursday up 7.6% at $38.92, the stock's highest level since June 4. The share price, which hit a 14-year low in late June, has recovered 36% of its slide since the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig triggered the spill.

Mr. Wells said BP engineers would consult every six hours with government scientists and decide whether to continue with the test.

The key to determining whether the cap can contain the oil until the relief well is done will be the results of pressure tests BP is conducting on the well. If the tests show that pressure under the cap is low, that means oil coming up from the underground reservoir is escaping out of the pipe and seeping into underground rock formations. This could present a problem as the oil fills up tiny holes in the rock and creates new fractures. Ultimately, the oil could find its way up to the seabed and begin leaking into the Gulf.

""We would not want that,"" retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, head of the federal spill response effort, said Thursday.

Officials say there is very little information about the condition of the well underground. The steel pipes might be in good shape. Or they could have been damaged by the initial blowout in April, or worn down over the past three months.

Richard Haut, a senior research scientist at the Houston Advanced Research Center and a well-technology expert, said dirt and debris shooting up the well alongside oil and natural gas could have worn down the walls of the pipe, allowing oil to escape into the rocks. ""That's the worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""You don't want to see oil escaping through the sides.""

If the well has been damaged, closing off the flow of oil and increasing the pressure could potentially worsen the problems. One reason for pessimism is that earlier this summer when officials pumped heavy drilling mud down the well in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to stop the flow, they were able to build up only a relatively low pressure.

Even if the well test succeeds -- and pressure readings remain high -- Mr. Allen said engineers planned to open the valves back up by Saturday afternoon and let the well flow again, collecting most but not all of the oil. New seismic tests will then be taken to see if there is any evidence of oil leaking out of the well below the surface.

Whatever the final judgment on the well's soundness, BP said the cap's installation was an important step for spill responders working to prepare for an expected busy hurricane season. The new cap can allow vessels on the surface collecting oil siphoned from the well to more quickly disconnect from the system and flee a storm. In that event, there would be a free flow of oil from the well. But if the cap can seal the well, spill responders can abandon the site knowing that oil could be contained. For the past several weeks, a more loosely fitting cap and containment vessels have managed to keep up to about 25,000 barrels of oil a day out of the Gulf. Federal officials estimate that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day are gushing from the well.
","NEW ORLEANS BP said Thursday that it had capped its hemorrhaging well, at least temporarily, marking the first time in 86 days that oil was not gushing into the Gulf of Mexico.

Oil stopped flowing around 2:25 p.m. when the last of several valves was closed on a cap at the top of the well, said Kent Wells, a senior vice president for BP.

The announcement came after a series of failed attempts to cap or contain the runaway well that tested the nationâs patience. Mr. Wells emphasized that pressure tests were being conducted to determine the status of the well, which is now sealed like a soda bottle. BP and the government could decide to allow the oil to flow again and try to collect all of it; they could allow the oil to flow and, if tests show the well can withstand the pressure from the cap, close the well during hurricanes; or they could leave the well closed permanently.

The last option seems unlikely, but whatever the decision, the cap is an interim measure until a relief well can plug the leak for good.

âI am very pleased that thereâs no oil going into the Gulf of Mexico,â Mr. Wells said, âbut we just started the test and I donât want to create a false sense of excitement.â

That was not much of a risk along the Gulf Coast, where countless livelihoods have been put in jeopardy and fishermen frequently and gloomily remark that Prince William Sound has never been the same since the Exxon Valdez disaster.

âItâs like putting a Band-Aid on a dead man in my opinion,â said Jeff Ussury, 48, who considers his days as a crabber over for good. He doubted the news of the capping was even true.

âI started out kind of believing in them,â he said, âbut I donât believe in them at all anymore.â

Whether it was just the eye of the hurricane or the morning after the storm, the moment was a time to take stock of just how much damage had already been done since the deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on the night of April 20.

For weeks, the BP spill camera which along with terms like âtop kill,â âcontainment domeâ and âjunk shotâ made up a growing list of phrases that many people wish they had never learned had shown a horrible chocolate plume of oil pouring upward from the broken blowout preventer, a symbol of government and corporate impotence. The plume has been a constant presence in the corner of TV screens, mocking reassurances from officials on the news programs who describe the latest attempt to stop the gushing.

But the view on Thursday afternoon was eerily tranquil, just the slate blue of the deep interspersed with small white particles floating across the screen. Though the exact amount of the oil that has poured out of the well may never be known, it was suddenly and for the first time a fixed amount. The disaster was, for a little while at least, finite.

At the White House, President Obama called the development a âpositive sign,â though he cautioned that the operation was still in the testing phase. In statements, Louisiana officials, including Gov. Bobby Jindal, said they were âcautiously optimistic.â

Officials at all levels played down expectations. Thad W. Allen, the retired Coast Guard admiral who is coordinating the spill response, told reporters on Thursday that the cap was primarily meant to be used to shut the well during extreme weather.

âThe intention of the capping stack was never to close in the well per se,â he said. âIt creates the opportunity if we have the right pressure readings to shut in the well. It allows us to abandon the site if there is a hurricane.â

He said that after the test, the cap would be used to capture oil through surface ships two that are on the site now and two more that will be in operation in a week or two. With all four collection ships in place, BP could capture all of the oil, estimated at 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day.

Mr. Wells cautioned that the test could take 48 hours or more, as scientists study pressure readings from the cap. If pressure rises and holds, that would be a sign that the casing the 13,000-foot string of pipe that lines the well bore is undamaged.

But if the pressure stays low or falls, that would suggest the well is damaged. In that case, Mr. Wells said, the test probably would be stopped well ahead of schedule, valves would be reopened and collection systems that had been shut down for the test would start again.

âDepending on what the test shows us, we may need to open this well back up,â he said.

The test had been delayed by about two days, first when the government ordered a last-minute review of the procedure out of concern that, by allowing the buildup of pressure, the test itself might harm the well. A particular fear, experts said, was that it might cause a shallow blowout damaging the well lining close to the seabed, which could allow oil and gas to escape into the gulf outside the well, making the spill worse.

By Wednesday afternoon, those concerns had been allayed and preparations were made to begin the test. But late that night, a hydraulic leak was discovered in part of the choke valve equipment, and the test was scrubbed.

Thursday afternoon the test began again, first with the shutting down of pipes that funneled oil and gas to two surface ships.

In even the most optimistic case, the BP oil spill is far, far from over.

There are still millions of barrels of oil out in the gulf and months of work missing for fishermen and shrimpers; inestimable harm is still being inflicted on wildlife throughout the food chain; and anger still seethes along the Gulf coast.

âWhatâs to celebrate?â asked Kindra Arnesen, the wife of a shrimper from Plaquemines Parish, La., who has become a recognizable voice of outrage over the past two and a half months.

âMy way of lifeâs over, theyâve destroyed everything I know and love,â she said, before going on to explain, in detail, why she believes the pressure tests are likely to fail.

22,22,2010-07-21-DoddFrank.txt,"Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat, have a seat.

Well, good morning, everyone.

We are gathered in the heart of our nationâs capital, surrounded by memorials to leaders and citizens who served our nation in its earliest days and in its days of greatest trial.  Today is such a time for America. 

Over the past two years, we have faced the worst recession since the Great Depression.  Eight million people lost their jobs.  Tens of millions saw the value of their homes and retirement savings plummet.  Countless businesses have been unable to get the loans they need and many have been forced to shut their doors.  And although the economy is growing again, too many people are still feeling the pain of the downturn.

Now, while a number of factors led to such a severe recession, the primary cause was a breakdown in our financial system.  It was a crisis born of a failure of responsibility from certain corners of Wall Street to the halls of power in Washington.  For years, our financial sector was governed by antiquated and poorly enforced rules that allowed some to game the system and take risks that endangered the entire economy. 

Unscrupulous lenders locked consumers into complex loans with hidden costs.  Firms like AIG placed massive, risky bets with borrowed money.  And while the rules left abuse and excess unchecked, they also left taxpayers on the hook if a big bank or financial institution ever failed. 

Now, even before the crisis hit, I went to Wall Street and I called for common-sense reforms to protect consumers and our economy as a whole.  And soon after taking office, I proposed a set of reforms to empower consumers and investors, to bring the shadowy deals that caused this crisis into the light of day, and to put a stop to taxpayer bailouts once and for all.  Today, thanks to a lot of people in this room, those reforms will become the law of the land. 

For the last year, Chairmen Barney Frank and Chris Dodd have worked day and night. Barney and Chris have worked day and night to bring about this reform.  And I am profoundly grateful to them.  I would be remiss if I didn't also express my appreciation to Senator Harry Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi for their leadership.  It wouldnât have happened without them.

Passing this bill was no easy task.  To get there, we had to overcome the furious lobbying of an array of powerful interest groups and a partisan minority determined to block change.  So the members who are here today, both on the stage and in the audience, they have done a great service in devoting so much time and expertise to this effort, to looking out for the public interests and not the special interests.  And I also want to thank the three Republican senators who put partisanship aside, judged this bill on the merits, and voted for reform.   Weâre grateful to them.  And the Republican House members.  Good to see you, Joe.

Now, letâs put this in perspective.  The fact is, the financial industry is central to our nationâs ability to grow, to prosper, to compete and to innovate.  There are a lot of banks that understand and fulfill this vital role, and there are a whole lot of bankers who want to do right -- and do right -- by their customers.  This reform will help foster innovation, not hamper it.  It is designed to make sure that everybody follows the same set of rules, so that firms compete on price and quality, not on tricks and not on traps.

It demands accountability and responsibility from everyone. It provides certainty to everybody, from bankers to farmers to business owners to consumers.  And unless your business model depends on cutting corners or bilking your customers, youâve got nothing to fear from reform.

Now, for all those Americans who are wondering what Wall Street reform means for you, hereâs what you can expect.  If youâve ever applied for a credit card, a student loan, or a mortgage, you know the feeling of signing your name to pages of barely understandable fine print.  What often happens as a result is that many Americans are caught by hidden fees and penalties, or saddled with loans they canât afford. 

Thatâs what happened to Robin Fox, hit with a massive rate increase on her credit card balance even though she paid her bills on time.  Thatâs what happened to Andrew Giordano, who discovered hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees on his bank statement -- fees he had no idea he might face.  Both are here today.  Well, with this law, unfair rate hikes, like the one that hit Robin, will end for good.  And weâll ensure that people like Andrew arenât unwittingly caught by overdraft fees when they sign up for a checking account.

With this law, weâll crack down on abusive practices in the mortgage industry.  Weâll make sure that contracts are simpler -- putting an end to many hidden penalties and fees in complex mortgages -- so folks know what theyâre signing. 

With this law, students who take out college loans will be provided clear and concise information about their obligations. 

And with this law, ordinary investors -- like seniors and folks saving for retirement -- will be able to receive more information about the costs and risks of mutual funds and other investment products, so that they can make better financial decisions as to what will work for them. 

So, all told, these reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history.  In history.  And these protections will be enforced by a new consumer watchdog with just one job:  looking out for people -- not big banks, not lenders, not investment houses -- looking out for people as they interact with the financial system.

And thatâs not just good for consumers; thatâs good for the economy.  Because reform will put a stop to a lot of the bad loans that fueled a debt-based bubble.  And it will mean all companies will have to seek customers by offering better products, instead of more deceptive ones.

Now, beyond the consumer protections Iâve outlined, reform will also rein in the abuse and excess that nearly brought down our financial system.  It will finally bring transparency to the kinds of complex and risky transactions that helped trigger the financial crisis.  Shareholders will also have a greater say on the pay of CEOs and other executives, so they can reward success instead of failure.

And finally, because of this law, the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Streetâs mistakes.  There will be no more tax-funded bailouts -- period.  If a large financial institution should ever fail, this reform gives us the ability to wind it down without endangering the broader economy.  And there will be new rules to make clear that no firm is somehow protected because it is âtoo big to fail,â so we donât have another AIG. 

That's what this reform will mean.  Now, it doesnât mean our work is over.  For these new rules to be effective, regulators will have to be vigilant.  We may need to make adjustments along the way as our financial system adapts to these new changes and changes around the globe.  No law can force anybody to be responsible; itâs still incumbent on those on Wall Street to heed the lessons of this crisis in terms of how they conduct their businesses.

The fact is every American -- from Main Street to Wall Street -- has a stake in our financial system.  Wall Street banks and firms invest the capital that makes it possible for start-ups to sell new products.  They provide loans to businesses to expand and to hire.  They back mortgages for families purchasing a new home.  Thatâs why weâll all stand to gain from these reforms.  We all win when investors around the world have confidence in our markets.  We all win when shareholders have more power and more information.  We all win when consumers are protected against abuse.  And we all win when folks are rewarded based on how well they perform, not how well they evade accountability.

In the end, our financial system only works -- our market is only free -- when there are clear rules and basic safeguards that prevent abuse, that check excess, that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system.  And thatâs what these reforms are designed to achieve -- no more, no less.  Because thatâs how we will ensure that our economy works for consumers, that it works for investors, that it works for financial institutions -- that it works for all of us.

This is the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history.  Ultimately, thereâs no dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street.  We rise or fall together as one nation. So these reforms will help lift our economy and lead all of us to a stronger, more prosperous future.

And thatâs why Iâm so honored to sign these reforms into law, and Iâm so grateful to everybody who worked so hard to make this day possible. 

Thank you very much, everybody.
","President Barack Obama on Wednesday signed into law the most sweeping financial overhaul since the Depression, putting the country on a course toward a more muscular regulatory framework.

The law gives the government authority to take over and liquidate failing financial firms, injects transparency into transactions involving financial instruments called derivatives and will restrict banks from making risky bets with their own capital. It directs agencies to write hundreds of new rules.

But one provision that barely survived will have the most direct bearing on millions of ordinary people's lives: a new agency meant to protect consumers from abusive financial products, called the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.

The proposal was the source of some of the most intense debates in the long struggle over the financial-regulatory overhaul, and the battles are far from over.

The biggest looming one is over who will head the agency, and that heated up this week as liberal groups insisted the White House give the job to Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School -- whose idea the agency was. Banking groups were urging key senators to oppose Ms. Warren, calling her an activist who would impose policies they argue would hurt the availability of credit, especially for those with low incomes.

With Democratic leaders in Congress joining liberal consumer groups and unions in pushing for Ms. Warren -- and with many Republicans opposed -- the contest is shaping up to have the intensity and drama of a Supreme Court nomination. Senate confirmation is needed.

Mr. Obama's choice, expected soon, will be a momentous one because the first director will have great influence over agency's direction, wielding a roughly $500 million annual budget that doesn't require approval from Congress.

The new consumer regulator will be funded by the Federal Reserve and have independent powers to write and enforce rules governing how loans and other financial products are offered, bearing on everything from the type of mortgages people can get to the fees on their credit cards.

The agency will be able to enforce its rules against any bank with more than $10 billion of assets, as well as all large mortgage lenders, student-loan companies and payday-loan firms.

It will have an army of examiners to probe these companies' practices. Small banks will have to follow the new rules written by the agency but they will be examined by other federal regulators.

The bureau's policies and rules could be overturned by other regulators only if they ""would put the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system or the stability of the financial system of the U.S. at risk.""

As a new agency born out of a deep economic downturn, the agency is a modern analog of the bureaucracies spawned by the Depression, like the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

Signing the financial-overhaul bill on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said, ""Our financial system only works -- our market is only free -- when there are clear rules and basic safeguards that prevent abuse, that check excess, that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system. And that's what these reforms are designed to achieve.""

Ms. Warren had a front-row place at the ceremony, and afterward lunched with White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. On Thursday, about a dozen Democratic legislators are holding a news conference to call for Ms. Warren to be nominated to head the agency. But Sen. Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, said Monday Ms. Warren might not be ""confirmable.""

Another candidate to head the consumer agency is Michael Barr, an assistant Treasury secretary and former University of Michigan law professor. During debate over how to construct the new financial regulations, Mr. Barr negotiated for months with bankers, and many prefer him to Ms. Warren. Mr. Barr also is very close to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, which could help his candidacy.

Also a possibility is Gene Kimmelman, the Justice Department's chief counsel for competition policy and intergovernmental relations. He, like Mr. Barr and Ms. Warren, has a record of advocating measures that could crimp banks.

From the day the proposal for a financial consumer-protection agency was introduced by Mr. Obama in June 2009, it repeatedly faded and was resurrected. The debate pitted the White House, congressional Democrats and labor unions against thousands of U.S. business people, from bankers and auto dealers to dentists and lobstermen.

Supporters said the government needed new powers to protect Americans from abusive financial practices such as hidden fees in the fine print, which they argue helped cause the financial crisis. Opponents said the agency was a sign of ""nanny state"" that treats regulators as better equipped than citizens to make decisions.

The bureau survived when a handful of activists, politicians and administration officials were able to splinter the opposition with a mixture of canny politics and luck.

Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, supporting a new agency, drove it through a balky House of Representatives. In the end, its structure -- and the compromise that smoothed its passage -- sprang from an off-the-cuff suggestion from one of its critics, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee.

Early last year aides to Mr. Obama, searching for ideas, dusted off a 2007 paper by Ms. Warren envisioning the new bureaucracy. A Harvard law professor born poor in Oklahoma 61 years ago, Ms. Warren was the granddaughter of a couple who lost their savings in the Depression after a bank failure. In the 1990s, after serving as an adviser to a bankruptcy review commission set up by President Bill Clinton, she waged a long battle against efforts to make personal bankruptcy laws more business-friendly.

The idea of a consumer financial agency wasn't universally popular in the Obama camp. Some aides warned Mr. Obama it would spark a big fight and might not pass.

In April 2009, White House chief economic adviser Lawrence Summers and Ms. Warren, longtime acquaintances from Harvard, met for three hours at an Indian restaurant in Washington, hashing out ideas about the possible design of such an agency. Playing a devil's-advocate role he often employs in policy debates, Mr. Summers questioned how such a bureau could be insulated from political influence. Ms. Warren left with a sense she had Mr. Summers's support of the agency.

Two months later, Mr. Obama appeared in the East Room of the White House before lobbyists, consumer activists and lawmakers and outlined his vision for the new consumer agency. Many were taken by surprise.

Consolidating powers of multiple regulators, it would write and enforce rules affecting a range of companies, from Wall Street banks to payday-loan stores. Almost any company that offered a financial product to consumers would have to answer to it.

Administration officials thought the concept would resonate so strongly with the public that it would smooth the passage for the entire financial overhaul. But bankers and Republicans went on the attack, saying it would create an ungovernable bureaucracy and restrict credit.

Twenty-three business groups representing a wide range of industries sent a letter to all House members a month later urging them to delay any vote on the new agency. The letter so roiled Capitol Hill that Mr. Frank had to scuttle a planned vote in his Financial Services Committee on the issue because it was unclear Democrats could hold together.

Two days later, Treasury deputy secretary Neal Wolin met 250 bankers in a ballroom at the Capital Hilton. ""We cannot go back to business as usual,"" he said, asking for their support for an agency.

Barrie Christman, chairman of Principal Bank in Iowa, stood up after the speech. ""As the doctors would say it: 'First, do no harm,'"" she said. ""We do believe there are solutions out there -- we just have significant concerns about many of the approaches that are in the current proposal."" She received thunderous applause.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce launched an ad campaign featuring a butcher complaining a new agency would drive up his costs. The ad attracted so much attention that in October it drew a rebuke from Mr. Obama, who called it ""completely false.""

Mr. Frank of Massachusetts strongly backed the agency, believing that some lenders, left to their own devices, will take advantage of consumers.

But he can be a pragmatist, and when he saw that votes for the proposal were slipping, he reshaped it. He scrapped a White House plan to require companies to offer no-frills versions of their financial products, and he offered exemptions to community banks, aiming to disarm an influential source of opposition.

Despite the changes, when the broad financial-overhaul bill neared a final House vote on Dec. 10, the agency's survival was in doubt. Rep. Walt Minnick, a conservative Democrat from Idaho, rallied support for replacing the agency with a council of regulators with skimpy powers. Mr. Frank, the White House and unions mobilized against the Minnick alternative, and it narrowly lost.

In the Senate, the agency proposal had a vocal critic in the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, Richard Shelby of Alabama, who called it a ""nanny state"" idea.

Mr. Dodd, under pressure from the White House and liberal groups, broke off talks he'd been having with Mr. Shelby. Mr. Dodd instead started negotiating with Sen. Corker, although the Tennessean also was opposed to a stand-alone consumer regulator.

On Feb. 24 the two met with Mr. Geithner. The Treasury secretary asked them to preserve the Fed's power to regulate banks. Seeing an opening, Mr. Corker interjected: ""If you want the Fed to have that supervisory power, can we just let the consumer regulator be housed there also?"" Messrs. Dodd and Geithner were noncommittal.

The following Saturday, Mr. Corker sat in his kitchen in Chattanooga, Tenn., scrolling through his BlackBerry as he and his aides put together a final proposal for Mr. Dodd on a consumer division within the Fed. When they finished, an aide printed out the proposal and walked it to Mr. Dodd's office. They didn't email a copy to anyone else for fear it might leak.

On March 2, The Wall Street Journal reported that Messrs. Dodd and Corker were near a deal. Activists on the left and right were shocked.

Mr. Frank dismissed it as a ""joke."" Ms. Warren told the Huffington Post that if Congress couldn't create a ""strong"" consumer agency, her preference would be ""no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.""

Said Mr. Corker a few days later: ""What happened was, you were on the five-yard line and the lights went out.""

White House officials told Mr. Dodd he should proceed without the support of Mr. Corker, because the concessions were too costly. But Mr. Dodd kept the core of Mr. Corker's offer, to win Republican support. He would house the agency within the Fed -- a seemingly technical change that nonetheless gave some in the GOP comfort the agency would be tamer.

To win broader political support, Mr. Dodd agreed to limit its scrutiny over auto dealers and also put many small businesses beyond its reach.

Even as that appeared to win the day, liberal groups were wary. Travis Plunkett, legislative director at the Consumer Federation of America, stayed in the Dirksen Senate office building until 4 a.m. on June 25 as Democrats negotiated the final bill. He stood for hours with a colleague in the hallway, at one point losing $5 in a vending machine as he tried to find caffeine to stay awake. He was there to protect against ""negative developments,"" he said.

Now that a consumer financial-protection bureau within the Fed has been approved -- and is expected to be fully operational within a year -- it remains to be seen what effect it will have on credit.

Some consumer advocates acknowledge that certain borrowers, particularly low-income people, will be affected, as products such as payday lenders are more tightly regulated. They say tighter controls will prevent borrowers from being hit with abusive loans.

At the signing ceremony, attended by nearly 400 people, Ms. Warren of Harvard Law moved through the room like a celebrity, as a number of lawmakers asked to have their pictures taken with her and she obliged. ""What a day,"" she said afterward. ""Who would have thought?""
","WASHINGTON President Obama signed a sweeping expansion of federal financial regulation on Wednesday, signaling perhaps the Democratsâ last major legislative victory before the midterm elections in November, which could recast the Congressional landscape.

Within minutes of the bill signing, several Wall Street groups were leveling criticism at the new regulations, reflecting Mr. Obamaâs increasingly fractious relations with corporate America.

The Business Roundtable complained in a statement that the law âtakes our country in the wrong directionâ and may discourage investment and job growth, echoing concerns made by the United States Chamber of Commerce and other business organizations.

In a signal that Wall Street is ready to keep lobbying as regulators work out the details of how to apply the new law, Larry Burton, the roundtableâs executive director, said: âWe will work with President Obama and policy makers to ensure this legislation is implemented in a manner that continues to promote sustainable economic growth and job creation.â

Still, Democrats and White House officials were euphoric about passage of the legislation, a response to the 2008 financial crisis that tipped the nation into the worst recession since the Great Depression.

The law subjects more financial companies to federal oversight and regulates many derivatives contracts while creating a consumer protection regulator and a panel to detect risks to the financial system.

A number of the details have been left for regulators to work out, inevitably setting off complicated tangles down the road that could last for years.

But âbecause of this law, the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Streetâs mistakes,â Mr. Obama said before signing the legislation. âThere will be no more taxpayer-funded bailouts. Period.â

He was surrounded by a group of mostly Democratic lawmakers and advocates of the overhaul legislation, including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, as well as Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, chairmen of crucial committees involved in developing the legislation.

The White House orchestrated a major signing ceremony at the Ronald Reagan Building across from the Commerce Department to trumpet the new law.

Mr. Obama took pains to try to show how the complex legislation, with its dense pages on derivatives practices, will protect ordinary Americans.

âIf youâve ever applied for a credit card, a student loan or a mortgage, you know the feeling of signing your name to pages of barely understandable fine print,â Mr. Obama said. âBut what often happens as a result is that many Americans are caught by hidden fees and penalties, or saddled with loans they canât afford.â

He said the law would crack down on abusive practices in the mortgage industry, simplifying contracts and ending hidden fees and penalties, âso folks know what theyâre signing.â

The law expands federal banking and securities regulation from its focus on banks and public markets, subjecting a wider range of financial companies to government oversight.

It also imposes regulation for the first time on opaque markets like the enormous trade in credit derivatives.

It creates a council of federal regulators, led by the Treasury secretary, to coordinate the detection of risks to the financial system, and it provides new powers to constrain and even dismantle troubled companies.

And it creates a powerful regulator, to be appointed by the president and housed in the Federal Reserve, to protect consumers of financial products.

The first visible result may come in about two years, the deadline for the consumer regulator to create a simplified disclosure form for mortgage loans.

Mr. Obama acknowledged three Republican senators Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts who broke with their party to approve the bill, saying that they âput partisanship aside, judged the bill on the merits and voted for reform.â

23,23,2010-07-26-Wikileaks.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody. I just concluded a productive discussion with the leaders of both parties in Congress. This was one of a series of regular meetings that I called for in the State of the Union because I think it's important for us to come together and speak frankly about the challenges we face and to work through areas where we don't agree; hopefully, find some areas where we do.

Our conversation today focused on an issue that's being discussed every day at kitchen tables across this country, and that's how do we create jobs that people need to support their families.

I believe that starts with doing everything we can to support small businesses. These are the stores, the restaurants, the startups, and other companies that create two out of every three new jobs in this country and that grow into the big businesses that transform industries here in America and around the world.

But we know that many of these businesses still can't get the loans and the capital they need to keep their doors open and hire new workers. That's why we've proposed steps to get them that help: eliminating capital gains taxes on investments, making it easier for small lenders to support small businesses, expanding successful SBA programs to help these businesses access the capital that they need.

This is how we create jobs, by investing in the innovators and entrepreneurs that have always driven our prosperity. These are the kind of commonsense steps that folks from both parties have supported in the past, steps to cut taxes and spur private sector growth and investment. And I hope that in the coming days, we'll once again find common ground and get this legislation passed. We shouldn't let America's small businesses be held hostage to partisan politics and certainly not at this critical time.

We also talked about the need to move forward on energy reform. The Senate is now poised to act before the August recess, advancing legislation to respond to the BP oil spill and create new clean energy jobs.

That legislation is an important step in the right direction, but I want to emphasize it's only the first step. And I intend to keep pushing for broader reform, including climate legislation, because if we've learned anything from the tragedy in the Gulf, it's that our current energy policy is unsustainable.

And we can't afford to stand by as our dependence on foreign oil deepens, as we keep on pumping out the deadly pollutants that threaten our air and our water and the lives and livelihoods of our people. And we can't stand by as we let China race ahead to create the clean energy jobs and industries of the future. We should be developing those renewable energy resources and creating those high-wage, high-skill jobs right here in the United States of America. That's what comprehensive energy and climate reform would do. And that's why I intend to keep pushing this issue forward.

I also urged the House leaders to pass the necessary funding to support our efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. I know much has been written about this in recent days as a result of the substantial leak of documents from Afghanistan covering a period from 2004 to 2009.

While I'm concerned about the disclosure of sensitive information from the battlefield that could potentially jeopardize individuals or operations, the fact is, these documents don't reveal any issues that haven't already informed our public debate on Afghanistan. Indeed, they point to the same challenges that led me to conduct an extensive review of our policy last fall.

So let me underscore what I've said many times: For 7 years, we failed to implement a strategy adequate to the challenge in this region, the region from which the 9/11 attacks were waged and other attacks against the United States and our friends and allies have been planned.

That's why we've substantially increased our commitment there, insisted upon greater accountability from our partners in Afghanistan and Pakistan, developed a new strategy that can work, and put in place a team, including one of our finest generals, to execute that plan. Now we have to see that strategy through.

And as I told the leaders, I hope the House will act today to join the Senate, which voted unanimously in favor of this funding, to ensure that our troops have the resources they need and that we're able to do what's necessary for our national security.

Finally, during our meeting today, I urged Senator McConnell and others in the Senate to work with us to fill the vacancies that continue to plague our judiciary. Right now we've got nominees who've been waiting up to 8 months to be confirmed as judges. Most of these folks were voted out of committee unanimously or nearly unanimously by both Democrats and Republicans. Both Democrats and Republicans agreed that they were qualified to serve. Nevertheless, some in the minority have used parliamentary procedures time and again to deny them a vote in the full Senate.

Now, if we want our judicial system to work, if we want to deliver justice in our courts, then we need judges on our benches. And I hope that in the coming months, we'll be able to work together to ensure a timelier process in the Senate.

Now, we don't have many days left before Congress is out for the year. And everyone understands that we're less than 100 days from an election. It's during this time that the noise and the chatter about who's up in the polls and which party is ahead threatens to drown out just about everything else.

But the folks we serve--who sent us here to serve--they sent us here for a reason. They sent us here to listen to their voices. They sent us here to represent their interests, not our own. They sent us here to lead. And I hope that in the coming months, we'll do everything in our power to live up to that responsibility.

Thanks very much.
","Thousands of secret military documents were released Sunday by a Web-based organization, a gigantic leak of classified information that appeared to present a bleak view of the Afghanistan war and could have a profound impact on the public perception of the conflict.

The release of the documents, which were obtained and made public by the website WikiLeaks, evoked the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of the Vietnam War, which when published contradicted the public narrative of that war and played a role in turning public opinion against it.

Coming at a time when President Barack Obama's Afghanistan strategy has come under increasing criticism, the release will likely stoke criticism of the war effort, as well as spark a debate about the manner in which the information was made available.

The release of the documents came on a day that U.S. and Afghan troops swept through a treacherous corner of eastern Afghanistan in search of a pair of missing Navy sailors as the Taliban said its fighters had killed one of the men in a shootout and its leaders would soon decide the fate of the other.

WikiLeaks allowed three publications, the Guardian newspaper in London, the magazine Der Spiegel in Germany and the New York Times, to have access to the documents for several weeks. Those news outlets released stories in a coordinated manner Sunday.

The documents are mostly raw field reports, some spare, some mundane and others rich with narrative details. Many of the low-level reports are the kind that some intelligence experts consider the equivalent of second-hand rumors, said one U.S. official.

The White House condemned the release of the documents, as it has in the past when WikiLeaks has made classified material public. Even as it condemned the leak, the White House also noted that the bulk of the material released was from the Bush administration.

""On Dec. 1, 2009, President Obama announced a new strategy with a substantial increase in resources for Afghanistan, and increased focus on Al Qaeda and Taliban safe-havens in Pakistan, precisely because of the grave situation that had developed over several years,"" Gen. James Jones, White House national security adviser, said in a written statement.

WikiLeaks said it was releasing some 91,000 documents, reports that cover a time period from January 2004 through the end of 2009. On its website, WikiLeaks also said it would delay the release of 15,000 reports at the request of its source. As it reviewed and redacted those documents, they too would be released, the statement said.

The most surprising finding in the reports may be that the Taliban have used sophisticated heat-seeking missiles against aircraft operated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Afghan resistance fighters used similar weapons, provided by the U.S., to great effect against the Soviet Army in the 1980s. The U.S. military has never publicly acknowledged that the Taliban possess such weapons.

According to the reports, the Pakistani military's Inter-Services Intelligence agency provided the Taliban with safe haven in Pakistan, even as Islamabad was aiding the U.S. war effort. That charge has often been made privately by U.S. officials. Even in public, Gen. David Petraeus, the top commander in Kabul, has said the ISI retains ties with the Taliban.

Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S., Husain Haqqani, condemned the leak as irresponsible and not reflective of the current situation on the ground in the region, adding that the U.S. and Pakistan are ""strategic partners"" working to defeat al Qaeda and the Taliban.

Other reports detail missions conducted by Special Operation Forces charged with hunting down top insurgent commanders. The reports claim successes but also note that mistakes have led to the death of Afghan civilians and, as a result, eroded U.S. standing in Afghanistan. The U.S. has increased the number of special operations teams and their operational tempo in recent months. Officials say rules put in place by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the former top commander, have minimized the collateral damage produced by the elite forces' raids. The reports note that a number of U.S. unmanned aircraft have crashed and collided, undermining the overall success rate.

The swiftness of the White House's response when the first stories about the WikiLeaks documents appeared suggests the Obama administration views the release of the reports as potentially damaging to the war effort. The administration has boosted the U.S. presence in Afghanistan by some 50,000 troops, but put in place a tight timeline, insisting it plans to begin a drawdown in about a year. The House of Representatives is due to debate a resolution on U.S. involvement in Pakistan this week.

""However illegally these documents came to light, they raise serious questions about the reality of America's policy toward Pakistan and Afghanistan,"" said Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a written statement. ""Those policies are at a critical stage and these documents may very well underscore the stakes and make the calibrations needed to get the policy right more urgent.""

The release is sure to put attention on WikiLeaks, a Web-based group devoted to publishing state secrets. In April, the organization unveiled classified footage of a 2007 U.S. helicopter attack in Baghdad that killed two Reuters' employees. In addition to video shot from a helicopter gunship, the group released a package of documents related to the attack; it sent correspondents to Baghdad to track down survivors of the incident and conduct follow-up interviews. At a news conference in releasing the video, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange called the pairing of investigative reporting with leaked footage a ""powerful combination.""

This month, the U.S. military said it would press criminal charges against an Army soldier, Pfc. Bradley Manning, for allegedly transferring classified military information to an unauthorized source. The charges appeared to be connected to the materials WikiLeaks released in April.
","WASHINGTON The White House sought to reassert control over the public debate on the Afghanistan war on Monday as political reaction to the disclosure of a six-year archive of classified military documents increased pressure on President Obama to defend his war strategy.

On Capitol Hill, a leading Senate Democrat said the documents, with their detailed account of a war faring even more poorly than two administrations had portrayed, would intensify Congressional scrutiny of Mr. Obamaâs policy.

âThose policies are at a critical stage, and these documents may very well underscore the stakes and make the calibrations needed to get the policy right more urgent,â said Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and has been an influential supporter of the war.

The disclosures landed at a crucial moment. Because of difficulties on the ground and mounting casualties in the war, the debate over the American presence in Afghanistan has begun earlier than expected. Inside the administration, more officials are privately questioning the policy.

In Congress, House leaders were rushing to hold a vote on a critical war-financing bill as early as Tuesday, fearing that the disclosures could stoke Democratic opposition to the measure. A Senate panel is also set to hold a hearing on Tuesday on Mr. Obamaâs choice to head the militaryâs Central Command, Gen. James N. Mattis, who would oversee operations in Afghanistan.

Administration officials acknowledged that the documents, released on the Internet by an organization called WikiLeaks, will make it harder for Mr. Obama as he tries to hang on to public and Congressional support until the end of the year, when he has scheduled a review of the war effort. âWe donât know how to react,â one frustrated administration official said on Monday. âThis obviously puts Congress and the public in a bad mood.â

Mr. Obama is facing a tough choice: he must either figure out a way to convince Congress and the American people that his war strategy remains on track and is seeing fruit, or move more quickly to a far more limited American presence.

As the debate over the war begins anew, administration officials have been striking tones similar to the Bush administrationâs to argue for continuing the current Afghanistan strategy, which calls for a significant troop buildup. Richard C. Holbrooke, Mr. Obamaâs special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the Afghan war effort came down to a matter of American national security, in testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee two weeks ago.

The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, struck a similar note on Monday in responding to the documents, which WikiLeaks made accessible to The New York Times, the British newspaper The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel.

âWe are in this region of the world because of what happened on 9/11,â Mr. Gibbs said. âEnsuring that there is not a safe haven in Afghanistan by which attacks against this country and countries around the world can be planned. Thatâs why weâre there, and thatâs why weâre going to continue to make progress on this relationship.â

Several administration officials privately expressed hope that they might be able to use the leaks, and their description of a sometimes duplicitous Pakistani ally, to pressure the government of Pakistan to cooperate more fully with the United States on counterterrorism. The documents seem to lay out rich new details of connections between the Taliban and other militant groups and Pakistanâs main spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI.

Three administration officials separately expressed hope that they might be able to use the documents to gain leverage in efforts to get more help from Pakistan. Two of them raised the possibility of warning the Pakistanis that Congressional anger might threaten American aid.

âThis is now out in the open,â a senior administration official said. âItâs reality now. In some ways, it makes it easier for us to tell the Pakistanis that they have to help us.â

But much of the pushback from the White House over the past two days has been to stress that the connection between the ISI and the Taliban was well known.

âI donât think that what is being reported hasnât in many ways been publicly discussed, either by you all or by representatives of the U.S. government, for quite some time,â Mr. Gibbs said during a briefing on Monday.

While agreeing that the disclosures were not altogether new, some leading Democrats said that the new details underscored deep suspicions they have harbored toward the ISI. âSome of these documents reinforce a longstanding concern of mine about the supporting role of some Pakistani officials in the Afghan insurgency,â said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee. During a visit to Pakistan this month, Mr. Levin, who has largely supported the war, said he confronted senior Pakistani leaders about the ISIâs continuing ties to the militant groups.

The White House appeared to be focusing some of its ire toward Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.org, the Web site that provided access to about 92,000 secret military reports.

White House officials e-mailed reporters select transcripts of an interview Mr. Assange conducted with Der Spiegel, underlining the quotations the White House apparently found most offensive. Among them was Mr. Assangeâs assertion, âI enjoy crushing bastards.â

At a news conference in London on Monday, Mr. Assange defended the release of the documents. âIâd like to see this material taken seriously and investigated, and new policies, if not prosecutions, result from it.â

The Times and the two other news organizations agreed not to disclose anything that was likely to put lives at risk or jeopardize military or antiterrorist operations, and The Times redacted the names of Afghan informants and other delicate information from the documents it published. WikiLeaks said it withheld posting about 15,000 documents for the same reason.

Pakistan strongly denied suggestions that its military spy service has guided the Afghan insurgency.

A senior ISI official, speaking anonymously under standard practice, sharply condemned the reports as âpart of the malicious campaign to malign the spy organizationâ and said the ISI would âcontinue to eradicate the menace of terrorism with or without the help of the West.â

Farhatullah Babar, the spokesman for President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan, dismissed the reports and said that Pakistan remained âa part of a strategic alliance of the United States in the fight against terrorism.â

While Pakistani officials protested, a spokesman for the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, said that Mr. Karzai was not upset by the documents and did not believe the picture they painted was unfair.

Speaking after a news conference in Kabul, Mr. Karzaiâs spokesman, Waheed Omar, was asked whether there was anything in the leaked documents that angered Mr. Karzai or that he thought unfair. âNo, I donât think so,â Mr. Omar said.

24,24,2010-08-31-EndIraqWar.txt,"Good evening.  Tonight, Iâd like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in Iraq, the ongoing security challenges we face, and the need to rebuild our nation here at home. 

I know this historic moment comes at a time of great uncertainty for many Americans.  Weâve now been through nearly a decade of war.  Weâve endured a long and painful recession.  And sometimes in the midst of these storms, the future that weâre trying to build for our nation -- a future of lasting peace and long-term prosperity -- may seem beyond our reach.

But this milestone should serve as a reminder to all Americans that the future is ours to shape if we move forward with confidence and commitment.  It should also serve as a message to the world that the United States of America intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century.

From this desk, seven and a half years ago, President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq.  Much has changed since that night.  A war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency.  Terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart. Thousands of Americans gave their lives; tens of thousands have been wounded.  Our relations abroad were strained.  Our unity at home was tested.

These are the rough waters encountered during the course of one of Americaâs longest wars.  Yet there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides.  At every turn, Americaâs men and women in uniform have served with courage and resolve.  As Commander-in-Chief, I am incredibly proud of their service.  And like all Americans, Iâm awed by their sacrifice, and by the sacrifices of their families.

The Americans who have served in Iraq completed every mission they were given.  They defeated a regime that had terrorized its people.  Together with Iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own, our troops fought block by block to help Iraq seize the chance for a better future.  They shifted tactics to protect the Iraqi people, trained Iraqi Security Forces, and took out terrorist leaders.  Because of our troops and civilians -- and because of the resilience of the Iraqi people -- Iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny, even though many challenges remain.

So tonight, I am announcing that the American combat mission in Iraq has ended.  Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.

This was my pledge to the American people as a candidate for this office.  Last February, I announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of Iraq, while redoubling our efforts to strengthen Iraqâs Security Forces and support its government and people. 

Thatâs what weâve done.  Weâve removed nearly 100,000 U.S. troops from Iraq.  Weâve closed or transferred to the Iraqis hundreds of bases.  And we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of Iraq.

This completes a transition to Iraqi responsibility for their own security.  U.S. troops pulled out of Iraqâs cities last summer, and Iraqi forces have moved into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens.  Even as Iraq continues to suffer terrorist attacks, security incidents have been near the lowest on record since the war began.  And Iraqi forces have taken the fight to al Qaeda, removing much of its leadership in Iraqi-led operations.

This year also saw Iraq hold credible elections that drew a strong turnout.  A caretaker administration is in place as Iraqis form a government based on the results of that election.  Tonight, I encourage Iraqâs leaders to move forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that is just, representative, and accountable to the Iraqi people.  And when that government is in place, there should be no doubt:  The Iraqi people will have a strong partner in the United States.  Our combat mission is ending, but our commitment to Iraqâs future is not.

Going forward, a transitional force of U.S. troops will remain in Iraq with a different mission:  advising and assisting Iraqâs Security Forces, supporting Iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilians.  Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all U.S. troops will leave by the end of next year.  As our military draws down, our dedicated civilians -- diplomats, aid workers, and advisors -- are moving into the lead to support Iraq as it strengthens its government, resolves political disputes, resettles those displaced by war, and builds ties with the region and the world.  Thatâs a message that Vice President Biden is delivering to the Iraqi people through his visit there today.

This new approach reflects our long-term partnership with Iraq -- one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect.  Of course, violence will not end with our combat mission.  Extremists will continue to set off bombs, attack Iraqi civilians and try to spark sectarian strife.  But ultimately, these terrorists will fail to achieve their goals.  Iraqis are a proud people.  They have rejected sectarian war, and they have no interest in endless destruction.  They understand that, in the end, only Iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets.  Only Iraqis can build a democracy within their borders.  What America can do, and will do, is provide support for the Iraqi people as both a friend and a partner.

Ending this war is not only in Iraqâs interest -- itâs in our own.  The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people.  We have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home.  Weâve persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization.  Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq, we have met our responsibility.  Now, itâs time to turn the page.

As we do, Iâm mindful that the Iraq war has been a contentious issue at home.  Here, too, itâs time to turn the page.  This afternoon, I spoke to former President George W. Bush.  Itâs well known that he and I disagreed about the war from its outset.  Yet no one can doubt President Bushâs support for our troops, or his love of country and commitment to our security.  As Iâve said, there were patriots who supported this war, and patriots who opposed it.  And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women, and our hopes for Iraqisâ future.

The greatness of our democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences, and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead.  And no challenge is more essential to our security than our fight against al Qaeda.

Americans across the political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked us on 9/11.  Now, as we approach our 10th year of combat in Afghanistan, there are those who are understandably asking tough questions about our mission there.  But we must never lose sight of whatâs at stake.  As we speak, al Qaeda continues to plot against us, and its leadership remains anchored in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  We will disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda, while preventing Afghanistan from again serving as a base for terrorists.  And because of our drawdown in Iraq, we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense.  In fact, over the last 19 months, nearly a dozen al Qaeda leaders -- and hundreds of al Qaedaâs extremist allies -- have been killed or captured around the world.

Within Afghanistan, Iâve ordered the deployment of additional troops who -- under the command of General David Petraeus -- are fighting to break the Talibanâs momentum. As with the surge in Iraq, these forces will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the Afghans to build their capacity and secure their own future.  But, as was the case in Iraq, we canât do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves.  Thatâs why weâre training Afghan Security Forces and supporting a political resolution to Afghanistanâs problems.  And next August, we will begin a transition to Afghan responsibility.  The pace of our troop reductions will be determined by conditions on the ground, and our support for Afghanistan will endure.  But make no mistake:  This transition will begin -- because open-ended war serves neither our interests nor the Afghan peopleâs.

Indeed, one of the lessons of our effort in Iraq is that American influence around the world is not a function of military force alone.  We must use all elements of our power -- including our diplomacy, our economic strength, and the power of Americaâs example -- to secure our interests and stand by our allies.  And we must project a vision of the future thatâs based not just on our fears, but also on our hopes -- a vision that recognizes the real dangers that exist around the world, but also the limitless possibilities of our time.

Today, old adversaries are at peace, and emerging democracies are potential partners.  New markets for our goods stretch from Asia to the Americas.  A new push for peace in the Middle East will begin here tomorrow.  Billions of young people want to move beyond the shackles of poverty and conflict.  As the leader of the free world, America will do more than just defeat on the battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction -- we will also lead among those who are willing to work together to expand freedom and opportunity for all people.

Now, that effort must begin within our own borders.  Throughout our history, America has been willing to bear the burden of promoting liberty and human dignity overseas, understanding its links to our own liberty and security.  But we have also understood that our nationâs strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home.  And the bedrock of that prosperity must be a growing middle class.

Unfortunately, over the last decade, weâve not done whatâs necessary to shore up the foundations of our own prosperity.  We spent a trillion dollars at war, often financed by borrowing from overseas.  This, in turn, has short-changed investments in our own people, and contributed to record deficits.  For too long, we have put off tough decisions on everything from our manufacturing base to our energy policy to education reform.  As a result, too many middle-class families find themselves working harder for less, while our nationâs long-term competitiveness is put at risk.

And so at this moment, as we wind down the war in Iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy, and grit, and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad.  They have met every test that they faced.  Now, itâs our turn.  Now, itâs our responsibility to honor them by coming together, all of us, and working to secure the dream that so many generations have fought for -- the dream that a better life awaits anyone who is willing to work for it and reach for it.

Our most urgent task is to restore our economy, and put the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs back to work.  To strengthen our middle class, we must give all our children the education they deserve, and all our workers the skills that they need to compete in a global economy.  We must jumpstart industries that create jobs, and end our dependence on foreign oil.  We must unleash the innovation that allows new products to roll off our assembly lines, and nurture the ideas that spring from our entrepreneurs.  This will be difficult.  But in the days to come, it must be our central mission as a people, and my central responsibility as President.

Part of that responsibility is making sure that we honor our commitments to those who have served our country with such valor.  As long as I am President, we will maintain the finest fighting force that the world has ever known, and we will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as they have served us.  This is a sacred trust.  Thatâs why weâve already made one of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades.  Weâre treating the signature wounds of todayâs wars -- post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury -- while providing the health care and benefits that all of our veterans have earned.  And weâre funding a Post-9/11 GI Bill that helps our veterans and their families pursue the dream of a college education.  Just as the GI Bill helped those who fought World War II -- including my grandfather -- become the backbone of our middle class, so todayâs servicemen and women must have the chance to apply their gifts to expand the American economy.  Because part of ending a war responsibly is standing by those who have fought it.

Two weeks ago, Americaâs final combat brigade in Iraq -- the Armyâs Fourth Stryker Brigade -- journeyed home in the pre-dawn darkness.  Thousands of soldiers and hundreds of vehicles made the trip from Baghdad, the last of them passing into Kuwait in the early morning hours.  Over seven years before, American troops and coalition partners had fought their way across similar highways, but this time no shots were fired.  It was just a convoy of brave Americans, making their way home.

Of course, the soldiers left much behind.  Some were teenagers when the war began.  Many have served multiple tours of duty, far from families who bore a heroic burden of their own, enduring the absence of a husbandâs embrace or a motherâs kiss.  Most painfully, since the war began, 55 members of the Fourth Stryker Brigade made the ultimate sacrifice -- part of over 4,400 Americans who have given their lives in Iraq.  As one staff sergeant said, âI know that to my brothers in arms who fought and died, this day would probably mean a lot.â

Those Americans gave their lives for the values that have lived in the hearts of our people for over two centuries.  Along with nearly 1.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq, they fought in a faraway place for people they never knew.  They stared into the darkest of human creations -- war -- and helped the Iraqi people seek the light of peace.

In an age without surrender ceremonies, we must earn victory through the success of our partners and the strength of our own nation.  Every American who serves joins an unbroken line of heroes that stretches from Lexington to Gettysburg; from Iwo Jima to Inchon; from Khe Sanh to Kandahar -- Americans who have fought to see that the lives of our children are better than our own.  Our troops are the steel in our ship of state.  And though our nation may be travelling through rough waters, they give us confidence that our course is true, and that beyond the pre-dawn darkness, better days lie ahead.

Thank you.  May God bless you.  And may God bless the United States of America, and all who serve her.
","President Barack Obama on Tuesday formally declared an end to combat operations in the seven-year-old Iraq War and, during an Oval Office address, promised to refocus the government from prosecuting wars to rebuilding the U.S. economy.

Calling on Americans to summon ""as much energy and grist and sense of common purpose"" to their domestic challenges that U.S. service members applied abroad, Mr. Obama, in an 18-minute address, said, ""Now, it is our turn.""

With U.S. troop levels in Iraq now below 50,000, the president marked the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom, launched by his predecessor, George W. Bush, and the start of a military-assistance mission dubbed Operation New Dawn. Mr. Obama said the milestone should serve ""as a message to the world that the United States of America intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century."" He sought to shore up support for his build-up in Afghanistan, where 98,000 U.S. troops are currently stationed, and which Mr. Obama emphasized would not be an ""open-ended war.""

Republicans marked the occasion by castigating those Democrats, including Mr. Obama, who had opposed the 2007 troop surge in Iraq and had called for a much earlier end to the war.

""It makes it easier to talk about fulfilling a campaign promise to wind down our operations in Iraq when the previous administration signs the security agreement with Iraq to end our overall presence there,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said. ""It sure makes things easier when you reject your own campaign rhetoric about how the surge. . .shouldn't happen and wouldn't work.""

The president used the prime-time forum of his second Oval Office address to move beyond the war debates that launched his White House quest to the more pressing political quagmire threatening his administration: a faltering economic recovery. The U.S. ""sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home,"" he said. ""We have met our responsibility. Now, it is time to turn the page.""

The Oval Office address and a quick trip to the Army's Fort Bliss, outside El Paso, Texas, culminated a two-day commemoration of the end of combat operations in Iraq. Vice President Joe Biden touched down in Baghdad on Monday and declared Tuesday morning that ""not withstanding what the national press says,"" the nation of Iraq is ""much safer"" than understood.

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, eager for a second term but facing bitter opposition from former Shiite Muslim allies and other factions after an inconclusive March election, seized on the milestone to bolster his standing. ""Iraq today is sovereign and independent, controlling its fate and everything related to its present and future,"" he said. ""[O]ur heroic forces and security apparatuses will have the lead role in strengthening security and defending the country.""

For Mr. Obama, the day's events came amid a slowing economic recovery and political storm clouds gathering ahead of the November elections. He reprised another campaign theme, that taxpayer resources being spent in Iraq should be invested in the U.S. economy. The war in Iraq cost more than $700 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

""Today, our most urgent task is to restore our economy, and put the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs back to work,"" he told the nation. ""This will be difficult. But in the days to come, it must be our central mission as a people, and my central responsibility as president.""

Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R, Ohio), said the president's pivot to domestic policy showed no clear plan to revive the economy beyond a call to ""unleash innovation"" and ""strengthen our middle class.""

The president told troops earlier at Fort Bliss that they had given Iraq ""an opportunity to create a better future for itself"" while making the U.S. more secure. That was a break from Mr. Obama's statement as a candidate that war in Iraq had fanned anti-American sentiment, left the Afghan war effort languishing and made the U.S. less safe.

But Mr. Obama said the end of combat operations was a time to thank U.S. service members, not relive political disagreements, and to acknowledge the sacrifices made in a war that cost more than 4,427 American lives and tens of thousands of Iraqi lives. Another 34,265 U.S. troops were wounded.

""Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,"" he said from the White House.

He said the debate over the wisdom of the war must end as well. Mr. Obama phoned Mr. Bush briefly Tuesday morning to talk about the speech. Mr. Obama pointedly didn't credit his predecessor's ""surge"" with the conclusion of combat. He did say, ""no one could doubt President Bush's support for our troops, or his love of country and commitment to our security.""

After the speech, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry (D, Mass.) echoed hopes of some Democrats that the issue of who did and didn't support the surge would be put to rest. ""The war over the war is over,"" he said.

In an August Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 49% said they approved of the way Mr. Obama has handled Iraq, versus 40% who disapproved. But Americans also signaled they are much more focused on domestic concerns now, with 73% saying their vote in November's elections would be based on issues at home, such as the economy, and just 12% saying they were focused on troubles abroad. During the last midterm elections in 2006, those figures were 43% and 28%, respectively.

Mr. Obama and his aides were careful not to declare ""Mission Accomplished,"" a slogan that haunted Mr. Bush for much of his presidency. The U.S. has ""no illusions"" that violence has ended, Deputy National Security Adviser Benjamin Rhodes said. Instead, Mr. Obama spoke of an ""enduring partnership"" that will bind Washington and Baghdad for years to come.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates struck a somber tone in a speech to the American Legion's national convention on Tuesday. ""Sectarian tensions remain a fact of life, al Qaeda in Iraq is beaten, but not gone,"" Mr. Gates said. ""This is not a time for premature victory parades or self-congratulations.""
","WASHINGTON â President Obama declared an end on Tuesday to the seven-year American combat mission in Iraq, saying that the United States has met its responsibility to that country and that it is now time to turn to pressing problems at home.

In a prime-time address from the Oval Office, Mr. Obama balanced praise for the troops who fought and died in Iraq with his conviction that getting into the conflict had been a mistake in the first place. But he also used the moment to emphasize that he sees his primary job as addressing the weak economy and other domestic issues â and to make clear that he intends to begin disengaging from the war in Afghanistan next summer.

âWe have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home,â Mr. Obama said. âThrough this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq, we have met our responsibility. Now, itâs time to turn the page.â

Seeking to temper partisan feelings over the war on a day when Republicans pointed out that Mr. Obama had opposed the troop surge generally credited with helping to bring Iraq a measure of stability, the president offered some praise for his predecessor, George W. Bush. Mr. Obama acknowledged their disagreement over Iraq but said that no one could doubt Mr. Bushâs âsupport for our troops, or his love of country and commitment to our security.â

Mr. Obama spoke for about 18 minutes, saying that violence would continue in Iraq and that the United States would continue to play a key role in nurturing a stable democracy there. He celebrated Americaâs fighting forces as âthe steel in our ship of state,â and pledged not to waver in the fight against Al Qaeda.

But he suggested that he sees his role in addressing domestic issues as dominant, saying that it would be difficult to get the economy rolling again but that doing so was âour central mission as a people, and my central responsibility as president.â

With his party facing the prospect of losing control of Congress in this fallâs elections and his own poll numbers depressed in large part because of the lackluster economy and still-high unemployment, he said the nationâs perseverance in Iraq must be matched by determination to address problems at home.

Over the last decade, âwe have spent over a trillion dollars at war, often financed by borrowing from overseas,â he said. âAnd so at this moment, as we wind down the war in Iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy and grit and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad.â

Mr. Obama acknowledged a war fatigue among Americans who have called into question his focus on the Afghanistan war, now approaching its 10th year. He said that American forces in Afghanistan âwill be in place for a limited timeâ to give Afghans the chance to build their government and armed forces.

âBut, as was the case in Iraq, we cannot do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves,â the president said. He reiterated that next July he would begin transferring responsibility for security to Afghans, at a pace to be determined by conditions.

âBut make no mistake: this transition will begin, because open-ended war serves neither our interests nor the Afghan peopleâs,â he said.

This was no iconic end-of-war moment with photos of soldiers kissing nurses in Times Square or victory parades down Americaâs Main Streets.

Instead, in the days leading to the Tuesday night deadline for the withdrawal of American combat troops, it has appeared as if administration officials and the American military were the only ones marking the end of this countryâs combat foray into Iraq. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are all in Baghdad for the official ceremony on Wednesday.

The very sight of Mr. Obama addressing Americans from the Oval Office â from the same desk where Mr. Bush announced the beginning of the conflict â shows the distance traveled since the Iraq war began. On the night of March 20, 2003, when the Armyâs Third Infantry Division first rolled over the border from Kuwait into Iraq, Mr. Obama was a state senator in Illinois.

Mr. Bush was at the height of his popularity, and the perception at home and in many places abroad was that America could achieve its national security goals primarily through military power. One of the biggest fears among the American troops in the convoy pouring into Iraq that night â every one of them suited in gas masks and wearing biohazard suits â was that the man they came to topple might unleash a chemical weapons attack.

Seven years and five months later, the biggest fears of American soldiers revolve around the primitive, basic, homemade bombs and old explosives in Afghanistan that were left over from the Soviet invasion. In Iraq, what was perceived as a threat from a powerful dictator, Saddam Hussein, has dissolved into the worry that as United States troops pull out they are leaving behind an unstable and weak government that could be influenced by Iran.

On Tuesday, a senior intelligence official said that Iran continues to supply militant groups in Iraq with weapons, training and equipment.

âMuch has changed since that night,â when Mr. Bush announced the war in Iraq, Mr. Obama said. âA war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency. Terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart. Thousands of Americans gave their lives; tens of thousands have been wounded. Our relations abroad were strained. Our unity at home was tested.â

The withdrawal of combat forces represents a significant milestone after the war that toppled Mr. Hussein, touched off waves of sectarian strife and claimed the lives of more than 4,400 American soldiers and more than 70,000 Iraqis, according to United States and Iraqi government figures.

âOperation Iraqi Freedom is over,â Mr. Obama said, using the military name for the mission, âand the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.â

As Mr. Obama prepared to observe the end of one phase of the war, he called Mr. Bush from Air Force One, as he was en route to Fort Bliss in Texas to meet with American troops home from Iraq.

The two spoke âjust for a few moments,â Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters aboard the plane, declining to give any additional details.

American troops reached Mr. Obamaâs goal for the drawdown early â last week Gen. Ray Odierno, the American commander in Iraq, said that the number of troops had dropped to 49,700, roughly the number that would stay through next summer.

That is less than a third of the number of troops in Iraq during the surge in 2007. Under an agreement between Iraq and the United States, the remaining troops are to leave by the end of 2011, though some Iraqi and American officials say they think that the agreement may be renegotiated to allow for a longer American military presence.

The remaining âadvise and assistâ brigades will officially concentrate on supporting and training Iraqi security forces, protecting American personnel and facilities, and mounting counterterrorism operations.

Still, as Mr. Obama himself acknowledged Tuesday, the milestone came with all of the ambiguity and messiness that accompanied the war itself.

A political impasse, in place since March elections, has left Iraq without a permanent government just as the government in Baghdad was supposed to be asserting more control.

Republican critics of the president were quick to point out Tuesday that Mr. Obama opposed the troop surge that they credit for decreased violence in Iraq.

âSome leaders who opposed, criticized, and fought tooth-and-nail to stop the surge strategy now proudly claim credit for the results,â Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, told veterans at the national convention of the American Legion in Milwaukee.

25,25,2010-11-02-MidtermElections.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody.  Last night I had a chance to speak to the leaders of the House and the Senate and reached out to those who had both won and lost in both parties.  I told John Boehner and Mitch McConnell that I look forward to working with them.  And I thanked Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid for their extraordinary leadership over the last two years.

After what I'm sure was a long night for a lot of you -- and needless to say it was for me -- I can tell you that some election nights are more fun than others.  Some are exhilarating; some are humbling.  But every election, regardless of who wins and who loses, is a reminder that in our democracy, power rests not with those of us in elected office, but with the people we have the privilege to serve.

Over the last few months I've had the opportunity to travel around the country and meet people where they live and where they work, from backyards to factory floors.  I did some talking, but mostly I did a lot of listening.  And yesterdayâs vote confirmed what I've heard from folks all across America:  People are frustrated -- theyâre deeply frustrated -- with the pace of our economic recovery and the opportunities that they hope for their children and their grandchildren.  They want jobs to come back faster, they want paychecks to go further, and they want the ability to give their children the same chances and opportunities as theyâve had in life.

The men and women who sent us here don't expect Washington to solve all their problems.  But they do expect Washington to work for them, not against them.  They want to know that their tax dollars are being spent wisely, not wasted, and that we're not going to leave our children a legacy of debt.  They want to know that their voices arenât being drowned out by a sea of lobbyists and special interests and partisan bickering.  They want business to be done here openly and honestly.

Now, I ran for this office to tackle these challenges and give voice to the concerns of everyday people.  Over the last two years, weâve made progress.  But, clearly, too many Americans havenât felt that progress yet, and they told us that yesterday. And as President, I take responsibility for that.

What yesterday also told us is that no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here, that we must find common ground in order to set -- in order to make progress on some uncommonly difficult challenges.  And I told John Boehner and Mitch McConnell last night I am very eager to sit down with members of both parties and figure out how we can move forward together.

Iâm not suggesting this will be easy.  I wonât pretend that we will be able to bridge every difference or solve every disagreement.  Thereâs a reason we have two parties in this country, and both Democrats and Republicans have certain beliefs and certain principles that each feels cannot be compromised.  But what I think the American people are expecting, and what we owe them, is to focus on those issues that affect their jobs, their security, and their future:  reducing our deficit, promoting a clean energy economy, making sure that our children are the best educated in the world, making sure that weâre making the investments in technology that will allow us to keep our competitive edge in the global economy.

Because the most important contest we face is not the contest between Democrats and Republicans.  In this century, the most important competition we face is between America and our economic competitors around the world.  To win that competition, and to continue our economic leadership, weâre going to need to be strong and weâre going to need to be united.

None of the challenges we face lend themselves to simple solutions or bumper-sticker slogans.  Nor are the answers found in any one particular philosophy or ideology.  As Iâve said before, no person, no party, has a monopoly on wisdom.  And thatâs why Iâm eager to hear good ideas wherever they come from, whoever proposes them. And thatâs why I believe itâs important to have an honest and civil debate about the choices that we face.  Thatâs why I want to engage both Democrats and Republicans in serious conversations about where weâre going as a nation.

And with so much at stake, what the American people donât want from us, especially here in Washington, is to spend the next two years refighting the political battles of the last two.  We just had a tough election.  We will have another in 2012.  Iâm not so naÃ¯ve as to think that everybody will put politics aside until then, but I do hope to make progress on the very serious problems facing us right now. And thatâs going to require all of us, including me, to work harder at building consensus.

You know, a little over a month ago, we held a town hall meeting in Richmond, Virginia.  And one of the most telling questions came from a small business owner who runs a tree care firm.  He told me how hard he works and how busy he was; how he doesnât have time to pay attention to all the back-and-forth in Washington.  And he asked, is there hope for us returning to civility in our discourse, to a healthy legislative process, so as I strap on the boots again tomorrow, I know that you guys got it under control?  Itâs hard to have a faith in that right now, he said.

I do believe there is hope for civility.  I do believe thereâs hope for progress.  And thatâs because I believe in the resiliency of a nation thatâs bounced back from much worse than what weâre going through right now -- a nation that's overcome war and depression, that has been made more perfect in our struggle for individual rights and individual freedoms.

Each time progress has come slowly and even painfully, but progress has always come -- because weâve worked at it and because weâve believed in it, and most of all, because we remembered that our first allegiance as citizens is not to party or region or faction, but to country -- because while we may be proud Democrats or proud Republicans, we are prouder to be Americans.

And that's something that we all need to remember right now and in the coming months.  And if we do, I have no doubt that we will continue this nationâs long journey towards a better future.

So with that, let me take some questions.
","Republicans won control of the House of Representatives as voters dealt a stiff rebuke to President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party, in a historic wave that swept the GOP to power in most levels of government and corners of the country.

Key party figures -- including Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt of South Carolina and 17-term incumbent Ike Skelton, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee -- were knocked from office. Republicans re-emerged in New England, a GOP-free zone after 2008.

In a major consolation, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid fended off a challenge from a tea-party backed Republican challenger, Sharron Angle, helping Democrats retain the Senate. Republicans nonetheless made gains in the upper chamber, picking up five seats as of early Wednesday morning. The GOP won a series of state houses and governorships as well.

The result sets the stage for a shift in Washington to a divided government that could lead to gridlock. Democrats will control the Senate and the presidency, with Republicans running the House. That could lead to bipartisanship on a few matters -- including education and infrastructure -- but conflict on tough issues splitting the nation, such as taxes, the deficit and health care.

Mr. Obama must now decide how to fashion the remainder of his current term. The president will give his first public indication Wednesday, in a press conference at which White House officials say he will extend an olive branch to the GOP and urge cooperation on issues such as education, infrastructure and oil.

Yet he will defend the achievements of his first two years: a sweeping rewrite of financial-industry regulations, a new law on higher-education aid, and, most of all, the landmark health-care law.

He made a series of congratulatory calls to Republican leaders early Wednesday morning.

The president will be facing a sizable class of freshman Republicans on both sides of the Capitol that will be gunning for his achievements.

In bellwether House races in Indiana, Florida and Virginia, Democrats were swept out of seats that gave the party their majority in 2006.

Old Democratic bulls and mainstays of the party's moderate wing went down to surprising defeat, including Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, Tennessee Rep. Lincoln Davis, F. Allen Boyd of Florida and Texas' Chet Edward.

Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello also lost; as recently as Friday, the president campaigned for him as a hero of the Democratic Party. The Democrats even lost the Senate seat vacated by Mr. Obama, who traveled several times to Chicago to try to keep Illinois in his column.

Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, who is likely to be elected House Speaker by his party, said late Tuesday that Americans ""have sent an unmistakable message"" to Mr. Obama, ""and that message is: 'Change course.'""

The verdict on the tea-party movement's role in the election appears mixed. Ophthalmologist Rand Paul took a Kentucky Senate seat by a wide margin over Democrat Jack Conway, the state's attorney general. Marco Rubio, the former speaker of the Florida House who remade himself as a tea-party outsider, vanquished Gov. Charlie Crist in a Republican primary and again Tuesday in the general election to claim a Florida Senate seat. Republican Pat Toomey won in Pennsylvania.

But the biggest prize of the night, Mr. Reid, slipped away as did GOP prospects in Delaware, where another tea-party candidate, Christine O'Donnell, stumbled.

Republican gains came not only in Washington but also in state houses and governors mansions across the country. Underlying the voter upheaval is a salient point: This election was the first in nearly 30 years that took place with the unemployment rate flirting with 10%.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) touted his party's efforts on the economy Tuesday night, but conceded: ""We haven't done it . . . fast enough or big enough.""

Republicans won the governors' mansions in Michigan, Pennsylvania and South Carolina, where tea-party favorite Nikki Haley prevailed. Republicans now control both state chambers in Indiana and Pennsylvania, two states that will play a big role in next year's all-important congressional redistricting. They were among the seven state chambers the GOP picked up as of the early running.

Democrats did have some victories, including in Massachusetts where Gov. Deval Patrick, a close friend of the president, won reelection.

Election Day won't necessarily settle the volatile political landscape. Some Democrats started pointing fingers, preparing to blame the White House for the defeats. The GOP's gains were fueled by the tea party, but questions remain about that movement's longevity.

How quickly the economic pain dissipates will help determine the next election, too, shaping a presidential race that is already showing signs of action. Exit polls suggested that anxiety about the economy was the largest issue on voters' minds, and that a narrow majority believes Mr. Obama's policies will hurt the country in the long run.

Republicans say their mandate is to reverse the Obama gains of the past two years, repeal the health-care act and pare federal spending, including the unspent balance of the president's 2009 stimulus law.

""Anyone whose guide is the constitution and goal is limited government, I'm willing to work with them today,"" said Sen. Jim DeMint (R, S.C.), in his victory speech Tuesday.

Before those legislative battles begin, a lame-duck Congress must return to Washington this month to pass bills to fund the government and deal with expiring tax cuts, including all of the income, estate, capital-gains and dividend-tax cuts approved under Mr. Bush. Looming over this will be the incoming Congress with its new GOP members.

Mr. Obama will press some of his own initiatives in the lame duck, hoping to ratify a far-reaching arms-control treaty with Russia and allow gays to openly serve in the military.

He and the new Congress will face pressure from voters. Liberal activists say the Democrats' poor showing stems from compromises made by party leaders on health care, gay rights and other issues. With dozens of moderate Democrats swept from office, the remaining Democratic Party in Washington will be more uniformly liberal.

The GOP will face a new element in its midst: tea party-fueled lawmakers who feel beholden to their supporters.

The results Tuesday showed the divide, with tea partiers including Messrs. Rubio and Paul winning alongside Republican veterans such as Rep. John Boozman in Arkansas, who beat Sen. Blanche Lincoln, Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire and former Bush trade representative Rob Portman in Ohio.

""Tonight there is a tea-party tidal wave, and we're sending a message,"" said Mr. Paul.
","Somewhere along the way, the apostle of change became its target, engulfed by the same currents that swept him to the White House two years ago. Now, President Obama must find a way to recalibrate with nothing less than his presidency on the line.

The verdict delivered by voters on Tuesday effectively put an end to his transformational ambitions and left him searching for a way forward with a more circumscribed horizon of possibilities. Facing a hostile House with subpoena power and a diminished majority in the Senate, he will have to figure out the right blend of conciliation and confrontation to reassert authority and avoid defeat in 2012.

The most pressing question as Mr. Obama picks through the results on Wednesday morning will be what lessons he takes from the electoral reversals. Was this the natural and unavoidable backlash in a time of historic economic distress, or was it a repudiation of a big-spending activist government? Was it primarily a failure of communications as the White House has suggested lately, or was it a fundamental disconnect with the values and priorities of the American public?

âHe will read the results carefully and hear the messages the American people are sending,â David Axelrod, the presidentâs senior adviser, said in an interview. âI think heâll do that with care and with humility. But heâs also very centered, and his impulse is to focus on what we do next and how we respond in a way thatâs constructive.â

Mr. Obama remained out of sight Tuesday night, watching the returns in the White House residence with his family, but he plans to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon to call on the country to put the divisive elections behind it and forge bipartisanship for a new era, aides said. He will soon invite leaders of both parties to meet to develop a common agenda to fix the economy and tame the deficit.

But fresh from their victories, Republicans may have little incentive to defer to Mr. Obama. âThe American people have sent an unmistakable message to him tonight and the message is: change course,â Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the putative new Republican speaker, said Tuesday night. In the days leading up to the election, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said âthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.â

The viability of the new political order in Washington will get a swift test when Congress returns to town for a lame-duck session this month. Mr. Obama may have to give ground and agree to at least a temporary extension of expiring tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, not just the middle class as he favors. He will be pressured to show that he is serious about reining in government spending.

Beyond the near term, the president appears likely to turn to more incremental initiatives in Congress and more aggressive use of his own executive authority to advance his agenda. In a recent interview, Mr. Obama listed areas where he thought he might be able to work with a new Congress: reforming immigration, curbing deficit spending and overhauling education.

âThe president is somebody who knows heâs not going to have his way on these things, that he needs Republicans and he has the ability to reach out to them,â said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the most prominent Republican in the administration.

At the same time, much of Mr. Obamaâs time may be spent on the defensive, fending off efforts by House Republicans to repeal or refuse to finance the health care program he pushed through this year. Of course, he will still have a relatively free hand in foreign policy, as he will demonstrate by leaving town on Friday for a long-delayed trip to Asia.

Mr. Obama finds himself in a similar position to his two most recent predecessors, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, each of whom endured a midterm election that handed Congress to the opposition. While distinguished by different factors, each of those elections was cast as a referendum on the president. Thirty-seven percent of voters in exit polls on Tuesday said they cast their vote to express opposition to Mr. Obama, compared with 24 percent who said they were trying to support him almost identical to the numbers for Mr. Bush four years ago.

Mr. Clinton responded to his partyâs 1994 losses by tacking to the middle and cutting deals with Republicans on welfare while outmaneuvering them during a government shutdown. With the Iraq war effort flailing, Mr. Bush fired Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld the day after the 2006 election, but battled with Democrats over war spending and other issues.

Strategists on both sides said the lessons of the past offered only limited utility. As politically toxic as the atmosphere in Washington was in the 1990s, the two sides appear even more polarized today. The Republicans may be more beholden to a Tea Party movement that abhors deal cutting, while Mr. Obama has not shown the same sort of centrist sensibilities that Mr. Clinton did and presides in a time of higher unemployment and deficits.

âI know President Clinton. President Clinton was an acquaintance of mine. Obama is no President Clinton,â said former Representative Dick Armey of Texas, who as House Republican leader squared off against Mr. Clinton at the time and today is a prime Tea Party promoter. âPersonally, I think heâs already lost his re-election.â

That remains to be determined, but he can expect a rough two years. If nothing else, both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush saw what can happen when the other side gets subpoena power. Legitimate oversight and political fishing expeditions can both take their toll.

âEven when carefully managed, these investigations can be distracting to senior White House officials,â said W. Neil Eggleston, who was a White House lawyer under Mr. Clinton and later represented an aide to Mr. Bush during a Congressional inquiry.

Still, Mr. Obama wields the veto pen, and his Democratic allies in the Senate will provide a firewall against Republican initiatives. The possibility of gridlock looms. And in the White House, there is hope that Republicans descend into fratricide between establishment and Tea Party insurgents, while Mr. Obama presents himself as above it all.

Former Representative Tom Davis, Republican of Virginia, said it was hard to see Mr. Obama finding common cause with Mr. Boehner or Mr. McConnell, the Republican leaders.

âObamaâs denigrated Boehner and McConnell by name not very presidential,â Mr. Davis said. Moreover, both sides will have to answer to partisans on the left and the right with little interest in compromise.

âThereâs going to be a lot of posturing to the base,â Mr. Davis said. âI think itâs going to be ugly, at least at first.â

26,26,2011-01-08-TucsonShooting.txt,"Thank you.Â PleaseÂ  -- Please be seated. To the families of those weâve lost; to all who called them friends; to the students of this university, the public servants who are gathered here, the people of Tucson and the people of Arizona: I have come here tonight as an American who, like all Americans, kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow. There is nothing I can say that will fill the sudden hole torn in your hearts.Â  But know this:Â The hopes of a nation are here tonight.Â  We mourn with you for the fallen.Â  We join you in your grief.Â  And we add our faith to yours that Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the other living victims of this tragedy will pull through. Scripture tells us: There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,the holy place where the Most High dwells.God is within her, she will not fall;God will help her at break of day. 1 On Saturday morning, Gabby, her staff and many of her constituents gathered outside a supermarket to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and free speech.Â They were fulfilling a central tenet of the democracy envisioned by our founders â- representatives of the people answering questions to their constituents, so as to carry their concerns back to our nationâs capital.Â  Gabby called it âCongress on Your Cornerâ -â just an updated version of government of and by and for the people. And that quintessentially American scene, that was the scene that was shattered by a gunmanâs bullets.Â  And the six people who lost their lives on Saturday â- they, too, represented what is best in us, what is best in America. Judge John Roll served our legal system for nearly 40 years. A graduate of this university and a graduate of this law school -- Judge Roll was recommended for the federal bench by John McCain 20 years ago -- appointed by President George H.W. Bush and rose to become Arizonaâs chief federal judge. His colleagues described him as the hardest-working judge within the Ninth Circuit.Â  He was on his way back from attending Mass, as he did every day, when he decided to stop by and say hi to his representative.Â  John is survived by his loving wife, Maureen, his three sons and his five beautiful grandchildren. George and Dorothy Morris -â âDotâ to her friends -â were high school sweethearts who got married and had two daughters.Â  They did everything together -- traveling the open road in their RV, enjoying what their friends called a 50-year honeymoon.Â  Saturday morning, they went by the Safeway to hear what their congresswoman had to say.Â  When gunfire rang out, George, a former Marine, instinctively tried to shield his wife.Â  Both were shot.Â  Dot passed away. A New Jersey native, Phyllis Schneck retired to Tucson to beat the snow.Â  But in the summer, she would return East, where her world revolved around her three children, her seven grandchildren and 2-year-old great-granddaughter.Â  A gifted quilter, sheâd often work under a favorite tree, or sometimes she'd sew aprons with the logos of the Jets and the Giants -- to give out at the church where she volunteered.Â  A Republican, she took a liking to Gabby, and wanted to get to know her better. Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard grew up in Tucson together -â about 70 years ago.Â  They moved apart and started their own respective families.Â  But after both were widowed they found their way back here, to, as one of Mavyâs daughters put it, âbe boyfriend and girlfriend again.â When they werenât out on the road in their motor home, you could find them just up the road, helping folks in need at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ.Â  A retired construction worker, Dorwan spent his spare time fixing up the church along with his dog, Tux.Â  His final act of selflessness was to dive on top of his wife, sacrificing his life for hers. Everything -- everything -- Gabe Zimmerman did, he did with passion.Â  But his true passion was helping people.Â  As Gabbyâs outreach director, he made the cares of thousands of her constituents his own, seeing to it that seniors got the Medicare benefits that they had earned, that veterans got the medals and the care that they deserved, that government was working for ordinary folks.Â  He died doing what he loved -â talking with people and seeing how he could help.Â  And Gabe is survived by his parents, Ross and Emily, his brother, Ben, and his fiancÃ©e, Kelly, who he planned to marry next year. And then there is nine-year-old Christina Taylor Green.Â  Christina was an A student; she was a dancer; she was a gymnast; she was a swimmer.Â  She decided that she wanted to be the first woman to play in the Major Leagues, and as the only girl on her Little League team, no one put it past her. She showed an appreciation for life uncommon for a girl her age.Â  Sheâd remind her mother, âWe are so blessed.Â  We have the best life.âÂ  And sheâd pay those blessings back by participating in a charity that helped children who were less fortunate. Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing.Â  Our hearts are broken -â and yet, our hearts also have reason for fullness. Our hearts are full of hope and thanks for the 13 Americans who survived the shooting, including the congresswoman many of them went to see on Saturday.Â  I have just come from the University Medical Center, just a mile from here, where our friend Gabby courageously fights to recover even as we speak.Â  And I want to tell you -- her husband Mark is here and he allows me to share this with you -- right after we went to visit, a few minutes after we left her room and some of her colleagues in Congress were in the room, Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.Â Gabby opened her eyes for the first time. Gabby opened her eyes.Â  Gabby opened her eyes, so I can tell you she knows we are here.Â  She knows we love her.Â  And she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey.Â  We are there for her. Our hearts are full of thanks for that good news, and our hearts are full of gratitude for those who saved others.Â  We are grateful to Daniel Hernandez -- a volunteer in Gabbyâs office. And, Daniel, Iâm sorry, you may deny it, but weâve decided you are a hero because -- you ran through the chaos to minister to your boss, and tended to her wounds and helped keep her alive. We are grateful to the men who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload.Â  Right over there.Â  We are grateful for petite Patricia Maisch, who wrestled away the killerâs ammunition, and undoubtedly saved some lives.Â And we are grateful for the doctors and nurses and first responders who worked wonders to heal those whoâd been hurt.Â  We are grateful to them. These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle.Â  They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength.Â  Heroism is here, in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens, all around us, just waiting to be summoned -â as it was on Saturday morning. Their actions, their selflessness poses a challenge to each of us.Â  It raises a question of what, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward.Â  How can we honor the fallen?Â  How can we be true to their memory? You see, when a tragedy like this strikes, it is part of our nature to demand explanations â- to try and pose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which seems senseless.Â  Already weâve seen a national conversation commence, not only about the motivations behind these killings, but about everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our mental health system.Â  And much of this process, of debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future, is an essential ingredient in our exercise of self-government. But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized -â at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happen to think differently than we do -â itâs important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that weâre talking with each other in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world, and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding. In the words of Job, âWhen I looked for light, then came darkness.âÂ  Bad things happen, and we have to guard against simple explanations in the aftermath. For the truth is none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack.Â  None of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped these shots from being fired, or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent manâs mind.Â  Yes, we have to examine all the facts behind this tragedy.Â  We cannot and will not be passive in the face of such violence.Â  We should be willing to challenge old assumptions in order to lessen the prospects of such violence in the future.Â But what we cannot do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other.Â That we cannot do.Â  That we cannot do. As we discuss these issues, let each of us do so with a good dose of humility.Â  Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, letâs use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy and remind ourselves of all the ways that our hopes and dreams are bound together. After all, thatâs what most of us do when we lose somebody in our family -â especially if the loss is unexpected.Â  Weâre shaken out of our routines.Â  Weâre forced to look inward.Â  We reflect on the past:Â  Did we spend enough time with an aging parent, we wonder.Â  Did we express our gratitude for all the sacrifices that they made for us?Â  Did we tell a spouse just how desperately we loved them, not just once in a while but every single day? So sudden loss causes us to look backward -â but it also forces us to look forward; to reflect on the present and the future, on the manner in which we live our lives and nurture our relationships with those who are still with us. We may ask ourselves if weâve shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives.Â  Perhaps we question whether we're doing right by our children, or our community, whether our priorities are in order. We recognize our own mortality, and we are reminded that in the fleeting time we have on this Earth, what matters is not wealth, or status, or power, or fame -â but rather, how well we have loved -- and what small part we have played in making the lives of other people better. And that process -- that process of reflection, of making sure we align our values with our actions â- that, I believe, is what a tragedy like this requires.Â  For those who were harmed, those who were killed â- they are part of our family, an American family 300 million strong. We may not have known them personally, but surely we see ourselves in them.Â  In George and Dot, in Dorwan and Mavy, we sense the abiding love we have for our own husbands, our own wives, our own life partners.Â  Phyllis â- sheâs our mom or our grandma; Gabe our brother or son.Â In Judge Roll, we recognize not only a man who prized his family and doing his job well, but also a man who embodied Americaâs fidelity to the law. And in Gabby -- in Gabby, we see a reflection of our public-spiritedness; that desire to participate in that sometimes frustrating, sometimes contentious, but always necessary and never-ending process to form a more perfect union. And in Christina -- in Christina we see all of our children. So curious, so trusting, so energetic, so full of magic.Â  So deserving of our love.Â  And so deserving of our good example.Â  If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate -- as it should -- letâs make sure itâs worthy of those we have lost.Â Letâs make sure itâs not on the usual plane of politics and point-scoring and pettiness that drifts away in the next news cycle. The loss of these wonderful people should make every one of us strive to be better.Â  To be better in our private lives, to be better friends and neighbors and coworkers and parents.Â  And if, as has been discussed in recent days, their death helps usher in more civility in our public discourse, let us remember it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy -- it did not -- but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation in a way that would make them proud. We should be civil because we want to live up to the example of public servants like John Roll and Gabby Giffords, who knew first and foremost that we are all Americans, and that we can question each otherâs ideas without questioning each otherâs love of country and that our task, working together, is to constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the American Dream to future generations. They believed -- they believed, and I believe that we can be better.Â  Those who died here, those who saved life here â- they help me believe.Â  We may not be able to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another, thatâs entirely up to us. And I believe that for all our imperfections, we are full of decency and goodness, and that the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us.Â   Thatâs what I believe, in part because thatâs what a child like Christina Taylor Green believed. Imagine -- imagine for a moment, here was a young girl who was just becoming aware of our democracy; just beginning to understand the obligations of citizenship; just starting to glimpse the fact that some day she, too, might play a part in shaping her nationâs future.Â  She had been elected to her student council.Â  She saw public service as something exciting and hopeful.Â  She was off to meet her congresswoman, someone she was sure was good and important and might be a role model.Â  She saw all this through the eyes of a child, undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted. I want to live up to her expectations.Â I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it.Â  I want America to be as good as she imagined it.Â  All of us -â we should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our childrenâs expectations. As has already been mentioned, Christina was given to us on September 11th, 2001, one of 50 babies born that day to be pictured in a book called âFaces of Hope.âÂ  On either side of her photo in that book were simple wishes for a childâs life.Â  âI hope you help those in need,â read one.Â  âI hope you know all the words to the National Anthem and sing it with your hand over your heart."" ""I hope"" -- ""I hope you jump in rain puddles.â If there are rain puddles in Heaven, Christina is jumping in them today.Â  And here on this Earth -- here on this Earth, we place our hands over our hearts, and we commit ourselves as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle, happy spirit. May God bless and keep those weâve lost in restful and eternal peace.Â   May He love and watch over the survivors. And may He bless the United States of America.","Bouquets, candles and handwritten notes piled up Sunday in public memorials across this city as residents struggled with the attack that killed six and wounded more than a dozen others, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

The victims at the ""Congress on Your Corner"" event outside a Safeway supermarket Saturday included a federal judge who had just come from Mass and a 9-year-old girl who had recently been elected to her student council and wanted to see politics up close.

A young social worker, engaged to be married, was killed in the attack, as was a great-grandmother who stitched aprons to sell at church craft fairs and gathered her family around a huge turkey dinner each Christmas.

""I can't make sense of it,"" said B.J. Offutt, whose mother, 79-year-old Phyllis Schneck, was killed. Ms. Offutt believes her mother, an avid cook and crafts-maker who talked about the importance of border security, may have stopped by Ms. Giffords's event to hear the Democratic lawmaker discuss the issue.

This has been a rough year in Tucson, a city of nearly 550,000 tucked amid craggy mountain ranges about 60 miles north of the Mexican border. Violence flared in late summer and early fall, with police reporting at least 17 homicides in six weeks.

""I can't wrap my heart around this,"" said Mike Nowak of Saturday's killings.

He is the minister at Mountain Avenue Church of Christ, a modest building with a small kids' playroom in the back labeled ""Dory's Room."" It's named for Dorwan Stoddard, the church member who built it. Mr. Stoddard, who was 76, was killed in the rampage. His wife, Mavanell, was wounded. They were both in line to meet Ms. Giffords.

""I don't have the right Scripture. I have nothing for you,"" Mr. Nowak told his shattered congregation Sunday.

He had just spoken, he said, to Mr. Stoddard's widow, who had watched her husband die, talking to him as he drew his final breaths, though he was unable to respond.

Several members of the congregation stood to share their grief. Kat Joplin, 38, recalled how much the Stoddards helped her when she was homeless, finding her a job and getting her settled in a motel. ""My heart is broken,"" Ms. Joplin said.

Memories flowed, too, at St. Odilia Catholic Church at a Mass in honor of another victim, Christina Taylor Green, a third-grader with a winning smile who sang in the Joyful Noise Choir.

Born on Sept. 11, 2001, Christina was featured in the book ""Faces of Hope,"" about children with that birthday.

Her father, a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers, told local media that Christina played second base in Little League and had been intrigued by politics for some time.

Christina was ""a gentle, beautiful little girl,"" said Teresa Bier, the parish's director of religious education.

Ms. Giffords's public session, one of a series she has held over the years, was intended to let her talk with constituents one-on-one. Her staff at the event included Gabriel Zimmerman, a trained social worker who focused on helping those in need, including veterans and the mentally ill.

Mr. Zimmerman, who was 30, was among those slain. His mother, Emily Nottingham, described him as ""a very happy and optimistic and very caring person.""

Also killed was Dorothy Morris, a 76-year-old grandmother who spent several years traveling the country in a motor home with her husband, George, a former airline pilot. Mrs. Morris was killed at the scene. Mr. Morris was shot twice and remains hospitalized, said a family friend, Bill Royle.

The couple, high-school sweethearts, retired to Arizona in the mid-1990s and built their dream home in the mountains, Mr. Royle said.

The sixth fatality was U.S. Judge John M. Roll, who had stopped by the event to talk with Rep. Giffords.

The grief extended beyond Tucson. At a concert Saturday night, the Phoenix Symphony added to the program a somber selection from Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations to honor the victims.

Music director Michael Christie asked the audience for silence after the piece, instead of applause. As the final notes died, the hall fell quiet, but for the sound of weeping.","Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, and 18 others were shot Saturday morning when a gunman opened fire outside a supermarket where Ms. Giffords was meeting with constituents.

Six of the victims died, among them John M. Roll, the chief judge for the United States District Court for Arizona, and a 9-year-old girl, the Pima County sheriff, Clarence W. Dupnik, said.

Ms. Giffords, 40, whom the authorities called the target of the attack, was said to be in very critical condition at the University Medical Center in Tucson, where she was operated on by a team of neurosurgeons. Dr. Peter Rhee, medical director of the hospital's trauma and critical care unit, said that she had been shot once in the head, ""through and through,"" with the bullet going through her brain.

President Obama, speaking at the White House, confirmed that a suspect was in custody and said that the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, was on his way to Arizona to oversee the investigation.

Investigators identified the gunman as Jared Lee Loughner, 22, and said that he was refusing to cooperate with the authorities and had invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. Mr. Loughner was in custody with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Saturday night, the Pima Country sheriff's office said.

Mr. Loughner had exhibited increasingly strange behavior in recent months, including ominous Internet postings -- at least one showing a gun -- and a series of videos in which he made disjointed statements on topics like the gold standard and mind control.

Pima Community College said he had been suspended for conduct violations and withdrew in October after five instances of classroom or library disruptions that involved the campus police.

The authorities were seen entering the Loughner family house about five miles from the shooting scene. Investigators said they were looking for a possible accomplice, believed to be in his 50s.

The shootings raised questions about potential political motives, and Sheriff Dupnik blamed the toxic political environment in Arizona. There were immediate national reverberations as Democrats denounced the fierce partisan atmosphere in Ms. Gifford's district and top Republicans quickly condemned the violence.

Mark Kimble, an aide to Ms. Giffords, said the shooting occurred about 10 a.m. in a small area between an American flag and an Arizona flag. He said that he went into the store for coffee, and that as he came out the gunman started firing.

Ms. Giffords had been talking to a couple about Medicare and reimbursements, and Judge Roll had just walked up to her and shouted ""Hi,"" when the gunman, wearing sunglasses and perhaps a hood of some sort, approached and shot the judge, Mr. Kimble said. ""Everyone hit the ground,"" he said. ""It was so shocking.""

The United States Capitol Police, which is investigating the attack, cautioned lawmakers ""to take reasonable and prudent precautions regarding their personal security.""

Because of the shootings, House Republicans postponed all legislation to be considered on the floor this week, including a vote to repeal the health care overhaul. The House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, said lawmakers needed to ""take whatever actions may be necessary in light of today's tragedy.""

Speaking of Ms. Giffords's condition, Dr. Rhee said at a news conference, ""I can tell you at this time, I am very optimistic about her recovery."" He added, ""We cannot tell what kind of recovery, but I'm as optimistic as it can get in this kind of situation.""

Ms. Giffords remained unconscious on Saturday night, said C. J. Karamargin, her spokesman.

Several aides to Ms. Giffords were wounded, and her director of community outreach, Gabriel Zimmerman, 30, was among those killed. The girl who died was identified as Christina Green, a third grader. The others killed were Dorothy Murray, 76; Dorwin Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79.

Ms. Giffords, who represents the Eighth District, in the southeastern corner of Arizona, has been an outspoken critic of the state's tough immigration law, which is focused on identifying, prosecuting and deporting illegal immigrants, and she had come under criticism for her vote in favor of the health care law.

Friends said she had received threats over the years. Judge Roll had been involved in immigration cases and had received death threats.

The police said Ms. Giffords's district office was evacuated late Saturday after a suspicious package was found. Officers later cleared the scene.

Ms. Giffords, widely known as Gabby, had been speaking to constituents in a store alcove under a large white banner bearing her name when a man surged forward and began firing. He tried to escape but was tackled by a bystander and taken into custody by the police. The event, called ""Congress on Your Corner,"" was outside a Safeway supermarket northwest of Tucson and was the first opportunity for constituents to meet with Ms. Giffords since she was sworn in for a third term on Wednesday.

Ms. Giffords was part of the Democratic class of 2006 that swept Democrats into the majority in the House. She narrowly won re-election in November, while many fellow Democrats were toppled and the House turned to Republican control.

""I saw the congresswoman talking to two people, and then this man suddenly came up and shot her in the head and then shot other people,"" said Dr. Steven Rayle, a witness to the shootings. ""I think it was a semiautomatic, and he must have got off 20 rounds.""

Dr. Rayle said that Ms. Giffords slumped to the ground and that staff members immediately rushed to her aid. ""A staffer had his arm around her, and she was leaning against the window of the Safeway,"" the doctor said. ""He had a jacket or towel on her head.""

At least one of the other shooting victims helped Ms. Giffords, witnesses said.

Television broadcasts showed a chaotic scene outside a normally tranquil suburban shopping spot as emergency workers rushed to carry the wounded away in stretchers. Some of the victims were taken from the site by helicopter, three of which had arrived.

Law enforcement officials said that the congresswoman had received numerous threats.

Congressional leaders of both parties issued statements throughout the day expressing outrage at the shooting as well as concern and prayers for Ms. Giffords and her family.

The new House speaker, John A. Boehner, said: ""I am horrified by the senseless attack on Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and members of her staff. An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve.

""Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society. Our prayers are with Congresswoman Giffords, her staff, all who were injured and their families. This is a sad day for our country.""

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, issued one of the strongest statements, saying: ""I am horrified by the violent attack on Representative Gabrielle Giffords and many other innocent people by a wicked person who has no sense of justice or compassion. I pray for Gabby and the other victims, and for the repose of the souls of the dead and comfort for their families.""

He added, ""Whoever did this, whatever their reason, they are a disgrace to Arizona, this country and the human race.""

Ms. Giffords is a centrist Democrat who won re-election in part by stressing her strong support for gun rights and for tougher immigration controls, including tighter border security, even though she opposed the controversial Arizona law.

Last March, after the final approval of the Democrats' health care law, which Ms. Giffords supported, the windows of her office in Tucson were broken or shot out in an act of vandalism. Similar acts were reported by other members of Congress.

In August 2009, when there were demonstrations against the health care measure across the nation, a protester who showed up to meet Ms. Giffords at a supermarket event similar to Saturday's was removed by the police when the pistol he had holstered under his armpit fell and bounced on the floor.

In an interview at the Capitol this week, Ms. Giffords said she was excited to count herself among the Democrats who joined the new Republican majority in reading the Constitution aloud from the House floor. She said she was particularly pleased with being assigned the reading of the First Amendment.

""I wanted to be here,"" she said. ""I think it's important. Reflecting on the Constitution in a bipartisan way is a good way to start the year.""

As a Democrat, Ms. Giffords is something of anomaly in Arizona and in her district, which has traditionally tilted Republican. Last year, she barely squeaked to victory over a Republican challenger, Jesse Kelly. But she had clearly heard the message that constituents were dissatisfied with Democratic leaders in Washington.

At the Capitol last week, Ms. Giffords refused to support the outgoing Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, in her symbolic contest with the Republican, Mr. Boehner of Ohio. Instead, she cast her vote for Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and hero of the civil rights movement.

""It's not surprising that today Gabby was doing what she always does: listening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbors,"" Mr. Obama said during a news conference Saturday, calling her a ""friend of mine"" and an ""extraordinary public servant."" ""I know Gabby is as tough as they come,"" he said. ""Obviously, our hearts go out to the family members of those who have been slain."" ""We're going to get to the bottom of this, and we're going to get through this,"" he said.

The shooting mobilized officials at the White House and throughout the highest levels of government, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department.

Rabbi Stephanie Aaron, who in 2007 officiated at the wedding of Ms. Giffords and the astronaut Mark E. Kelly, and leads Congregation Chaverim in Tucson, said the congresswoman had never expressed any concern about her safety. ""No fear. I've only seen the bravest possible, most intelligent young congresswoman,"" Rabbi Aaron said. ""I feel like this is really one of those proverbial -- seemingly something coming out of nowhere.""

At Ms. Giffords's district office, a group of about 50 people formed a prayer circle. Chris Cole, a Tucson police officer whose neighborhood beat includes the district office, said of the shooting, ""This kind of thing just doesn't happen in Tucson.""

Behind the office, in the parking lot, campaign volunteers stood around a car with the door open, listening to a live radio broadcast of a hospital news conference updating the congresswoman's condition. A cheer went up when it was announced that she was still alive.

The volunteers included Kelly Canady and her mother, Patricia Canady, both longtime campaign workers. Patricia Canedy had worked for Ms. Giffords since she served in the State Senate while Kelly, her daughter, moved to Tucson 13 years ago and was active in last year's campaign and in the health care debate.

""She's one of those people who remembers you. She always spoke to me by my first name,"" Kelly Canady said. ""She loved everybody. She was very easy to talk to. She was one of the main reasons I will stay involved in politics.""",2011-01-08,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.864, POS: 0.078, NEG: 0.058})",0.07833822816610336,0.863898754119873,0.057762984186410904,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.732, NEU: 0.263, POS: 0.006})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.879, NEU: 0.118, POS: 0.003})",0.005847098305821419,0.2625490128993988,0.7316038608551025,0.0030443815048784018,0.11809675395488739,0.8788589239120483
27,27,2011-01-26-StateOfTheUnion.txt,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans: Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress, as well as your new Speaker, John Boehner.Â And as we mark this occasion, weâre also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber, and we pray for the health of our colleague -- and our friend -â Gabby Giffords. Itâs no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years.Â  The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs.Â  And thatâs a good thing.Â  Thatâs what a robust democracy demands.Â  Thatâs what helps set us apart as a nation. But thereâs a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater -â something more consequential than party or political preference. We are part of the American family.Â  We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people; that we share common hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled. That, too, is what sets us apart as a nation. Now, by itself, this simple recognition wonât usher in a new era of cooperation.Â  What comes of this moment is up to us.Â  What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow. I believe we can.Â  And I believe we must.Â  Thatâs what the people who sent us here expect of us.Â  With their votes, theyâve determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties.Â  New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans.Â  We will move forward together, or not at all -â for the challenges we face are bigger than party, and bigger than politics. At stake right now is not who wins the next election -â after all, we just had an election.Â  At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country, or somewhere else.Â  Itâs whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded.Â  Itâs whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the light to the world. We are poised for progress.Â  Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back.Â  Corporate profits are up.Â  The economy is growing again. But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone.Â  We measure progress by the success of our people.Â  By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer.Â  By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise.Â  By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children. Thatâs the project the American people want us to work on. Together. We did that in December.Â  Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americansâ paychecks are a little bigger today.Â  Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year.Â  And these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year. But we have to do more.Â  These steps weâve taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, weâll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making. Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown.Â  You didnât always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors.Â  If you worked hard, chances are youâd have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion.Â  Maybe youâd even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company. That world has changed.Â  And for many, the change has been painful.Â  Iâve seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets. Iâve heard it in the frustrations of Americans whoâve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear -â proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game. Theyâre right.Â  The rules have changed.Â  In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business.Â  Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100.Â  Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever thereâs an Internet connection. Meanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science.Â  Theyâre investing in research and new technologies.Â  Just recently, China became the home to the worldâs largest private solar research facility, and the worldâs fastest computer. So, yes, the world has changed.Â  The competition for jobs is real.Â  But this shouldnât discourage us.Â  It should challenge us. Remember -â for all the hits weâve taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world.Â  No workers -- no workers are more productive than ours.Â  No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs.Â  Weâre the home to the worldâs best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any place on Earth. Whatâs more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea -â the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny.Â  Thatâs why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here.Â  Itâs why our students donât just memorize equations, but answer questions like âWhat do you think of that idea?Â  What would you change about the world?Â  What do you want to be when you grow up?â The future is ours to win.Â  But to get there, we canât just stand still.Â  As Robert Kennedy told us, âThe future is not a gift.Â  It is an achievement.âÂ  Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat.Â  It has required each generation to sacrifice, and struggle, and meet the demands of a new age. And now itâs our turn.Â  We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time.Â  We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world.Â We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business.Â  We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government.Â  Thatâs how our people will prosper.Â  Thatâs how weâll win the future.Â  And tonight, Iâd like to talk about how we get there.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation.Â  None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from.Â  Thirty years ago, we couldnât know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution.Â  What we can do -- what America does better than anyone else -- is spark the creativity and imagination of our people.Â  Weâre the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook.Â  In America, innovation doesnât just change our lives.Â  It is how we make our living. Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation.Â  But because itâs not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need.Â  Thatâs what planted the seeds for the Internet.Â  Thatâs what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS.Â  Just think of all the good jobs -- from manufacturing to retail -- that have come from these breakthroughs. Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon.Â  The science wasnât even there yet.Â  NASA didnât exist.Â  But after investing in better research and education, we didnât just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs. This is our generationâs Sputnik moment.Â  Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we havenât seen since the height of the Space Race.Â  And in a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal.Â  Weâll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology -â an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people. Already, weâre seeing the promise of renewable energy.Â  Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company.Â  After September 11th, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon.Â  But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard.Â  Today, with the help of a government loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country.Â  In Robertâs words, âWe reinvented ourselves.â Thatâs what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves.Â  And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, weâve begun to reinvent our energy policy. Weâre not just handing out money.Â  Weâre issuing a challenge.Â  Weâre telling Americaâs scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, weâll fund the Apollo projects of our time. At the California Institute of Technology, theyâre developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars.Â  At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, theyâre using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities.Â  With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015. We need to get behind this innovation.Â  And to help pay for it, Iâm asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies.Â  I donât know if -- I donât know if youâve noticed, but theyâre doing just fine on their own.Â So instead of subsidizing yesterdayâs energy, letâs invest in tomorrowâs. Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what theyâre selling.Â  So tonight, I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal:Â  By 2035, 80 percent of Americaâs electricity will come from clean energy sources. Some folks want wind and solar.Â  Others want nuclear, clean coal and natural gas.Â  To meet this goal, we will need them all -- and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen. Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to Americaâs success.Â  But if we want to win the future -â if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas -â then we also have to win the race to educate our kids. Think about it.Â  Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education.Â  And yet, as many as a quarter of our students arenât even finishing high school.Â  The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations.Â  America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree.Â  And so the question is whether all of us â- as citizens, and as parents â- are willing to do whatâs necessary to give every child a chance to succeed. That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities.Â  Itâs family that first instills the love of learning in a child.Â  Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done.Â  We need to teach our kids that itâs not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair.Â  We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline. Our schools share this responsibility.Â  When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance.Â  But too many schools donât meet this test. Thatâs why instead of just pouring money into a system thatâs not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top.Â  To all 50 states, we said, âIf you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, weâll show you the money.â Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation.Â  For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning.Â  And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country.Â  And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law thatâs more flexible and focused on whatâs best for our kids. You see, we know whatâs possible from our children when reform isnât just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities.Â  Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver.Â  Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado -- located on turf between two rival gangs.Â  But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma.Â  Most will be the first in their families to go to college.Â  And after the first year of the schoolâs transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, âThank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it.âÂ  Thatâs what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country. Letâs also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a childâs success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom.Â  In South Korea, teachers are known as ânation builders.âÂ  Here in America, itâs time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect.Â  We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones.Â And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math. In fact, to every young person listening tonight whoâs contemplating their career choice:Â  If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child -- become a teacher.Â  Your country needs you. Of course, the education race doesnât end with a high school diploma.Â  To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American.Â  Thatâs why weâve ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students.Â And this year, I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit â- worth $10,000 for four years of college.Â  Itâs the right thing to do. Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in todayâs fast-changing economy, weâre also revitalizing Americaâs community colleges.Â  Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina.Â  Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town.Â  One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old.Â  And she told me sheâs earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams, too.Â  As Kathy said, âI hope it tells them to never give up.â If we take these steps -â if we raise expectations for every child, and give them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they are born until the last job they take â- we will reach the goal that I set two years ago:Â  By the end of the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. One last point about education.Â  Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens.Â  Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents. They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.Â  Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities.Â  But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us.Â  It makes no sense. Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration.Â  And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows.Â  I know that debate will be difficult.Â  I know it will take time.Â  But tonight, letâs agree to make that effort.Â  And letâs stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this nation. The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America.Â  To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information -- from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet. Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped.Â  South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do.Â  Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do.Â  China is building faster trains and newer airports.Â  Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nationâs infrastructure, they gave us a âD.â We have to do better.Â  America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System.Â  The jobs created by these projects didnât just come from laying down track or pavement.Â  They came from businesses that opened near a townâs new train station or the new off-ramp. So over the last two years, weâve begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry.Â  And tonight, Iâm proposing that we redouble those efforts. Weâll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges.Â  Weâll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on] whatâs best for the economy, not politicians. Within 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail.Â  This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car.Â  For some trips, it will be faster than flying â- without the pat-down.Â  As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway. Within the next five years, weâll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans.Â  This isnât just about -- this isnât about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls.Â  Itâs about connecting every part of America to the digital age.Â  Itâs about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world.Â  Itâs about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor. All these investments -â in innovation, education, and infrastructure â- will make America a better place to do business and create jobs.Â  But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success. For example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries.Â  Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all.Â  But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.Â  It makes no sense, and it has to change. So tonight, Iâm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system.Â  Get rid of the loopholes.Â  Level the playing field.Â  And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years â- without adding to our deficit.Â  It can be done. To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -â because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home.Â  Already, our exports are up.Â  Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States.Â  And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs.Â  This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans -- and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible. Now, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs.Â  Thatâs what we did with Korea, and thatâs what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks. To reduce barriers to growth and investment, Iâve ordered a review of government regulations.Â  When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them.Â  But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common-sense safeguards to protect the American people.Â  Thatâs what weâve done in this country for more than a century.Â  Itâs why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe.Â  Itâs why we have speed limits and child labor laws.Â  Itâs why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis.Â And itâs why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients. Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law.Â  So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved.Â  If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you.Â  We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses. What Iâm not willing to do -- what Iâm not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition. Iâm not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered.Â  Iâm not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business man from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees.Â  As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patientsâ -- parentsâ coverage. So I say to this chamber tonight, instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, letâs fix what needs fixing and letâs move forward. Now, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we arenât buried under a mountain of debt. We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago.Â  And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in peopleâs pockets. But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in.Â  That is not sustainable.Â  Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means.Â  They deserve a government that does the same. So tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years.Â Now, this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President. Â Â Â Â Â  This freeze will require painful cuts.Â  Already, weâve frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years.Â  Iâve proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs.Â  The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without. I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and Iâm willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without.Â  But letâs make sure that weâre not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.Â  And letâs make sure that what weâre cutting is really excess weight.Â  Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine.Â  It may make you feel like youâre flying high at first, but it wonât take long before you feel the impact. Now, most of the cuts and savings Iâve proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget.Â  To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough.Â  It wonât. The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear.Â  I donât agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress.Â  And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it â- in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes. This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit.Â  The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit.Â  Still, Iâm willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year -- medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits. To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations.Â  We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americansâ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market. And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply canât afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.Â  Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break.Â  Itâs not a matter of punishing their success.Â  Itâs about promoting Americaâs success. In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code.Â  This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them. So now is the time to act.Â  Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress â- Democrats and Republicans -â to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done.Â  If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future. Let me take this one step further.Â  We shouldnât just give our people a government thatâs more affordable.Â  We should give them a government thatâs more competent and more efficient.Â  We canât win the future with a government of the past. We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV.Â  There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports.Â  There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy.Â  Then thereâs my favorite example:Â  The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while theyâre in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when theyâre in saltwater.Â I hear it gets even more complicated once theyâre smoked. Now, weâve made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste.Â  Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse.Â  Weâre selling acres of federal office space that hasnât been used in years, and weâll cut through red tape to get rid of more.Â  But we need to think bigger.Â  In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America.Â  I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote â- and we will push to get it passed. In the coming year, weâll also work to rebuild peopleâs faith in the institution of government.Â  Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, youâll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history.Â  Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done -- put that information online.Â  And because the American people deserve to know that special interests arenât larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this:Â  If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it.Â  I will veto it.Â  The 21st century government thatâs open and competent.Â  A government that lives within its means.Â  An economy thatâs driven by new skills and new ideas.Â  Our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation.Â  It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs. Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges.Â  No single wall separates East and West.Â  No one rival superpower is aligned against us. And so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion.Â  And Americaâs moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity.Â  And because weâve begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and Americaâs standing has been restored. Look to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high.Â American combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new government has been formed.Â  This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq.Â  Americaâs commitment has been kept.Â  The Iraq war is coming to an end. Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us.Â  Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, weâre disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies.Â  And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family. Weâve also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad.Â  In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces.Â  Our purpose is clear:Â  By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11. Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency.Â  There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance.Â  But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them.Â  This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead.Â  And this July, we will begin to bring our troops home. In Pakistan, al Qaedaâs leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001.Â  Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield.Â  Their safe havens are shrinking.Â  And weâve sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe:Â  We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you. American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war.Â  Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed.Â  Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists. Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before.Â  And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons. This is just a part of how weâre shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity.Â  With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense.Â  Weâve reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, built new partnerships with nations like India. This March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas.Â  Around the globe, weâre standing with those who take responsibility -â helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity. Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power -â it must also be the purpose behind it.Â  In south Sudan -â with our assistance -â the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war.Â  Thousands lined up before dawn.Â  People danced in the streets.Â  One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him:Â  âThis was a battlefield for most of my life,â he said.Â  âNow we want to be free.â  And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator.Â  And tonight, let us be clear:Â  The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people. We must never forget that the things weâve struggled for, and fought for, live in the hearts of people everywhere.Â  And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country. Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families.Â  Let us serve them as well as theyâve served us -- by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation. Our troops come from every corner of this country -â theyâre black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American.Â  They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim.Â  And, yes, we know that some of them are gay.Â  Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love.Â  And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC.Â  It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past.Â  It is time to move forward as one nation. We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit â- none of this will be easy.Â  All of it will take time.Â  And it will be harder because we will argue about everything.Â  The costs.Â  The details.Â  The letter of every law. Of course, some countries donât have this problem.Â  If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed.Â  If they donât want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesnât get written. And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isnât a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth. We may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution.Â  We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try.Â  We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible.Â  No matter who you are.Â  No matter where you come from. That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight.Â  That dream is why a working-class kid from Scranton can sit behind me.Â That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his fatherâs Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth. That dream -â that American Dream -â is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era.Â  Itâs what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future.Â  And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher. Brandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology.Â  And one day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them. But Brandon thought his company could help.Â  And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B.Â  His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment.Â  And Brandon left for Chile. Along with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground, working three- or four-hour -- three or four days at a time without any sleep.Â  Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded, and the miners were rescued.Â  But because he didnât want all of the attention, Brandon wasnât there when the miners emerged.Â  Heâd already gone back home, back to work on his next project. And later, one of his employees said of the rescue, âWe proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things.â We do big things. From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream.Â  Thatâs how we win the future. Weâre a nation that says, âI might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company.âÂ  âI might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.âÂ  âI might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try.âÂ  âIâm not sure how weâll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know weâll get there.Â  I know we will.â We do big things. The idea of America endures.Â  Our destiny remains our choice.Â  And tonight, more than two centuries later, itâs because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong. Thank you.Â  God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.","President Barack Obama used his State of the Union address Tuesday to ask the nation to meet the challenges of a global economy, framing what he called a competitiveness agenda that includes traditional Democratic proposals like increased education spending, alongside gestures to Republicans seeking deep budget cuts.

Mr. Obama said the nation needs to address its rising budget deficit but couldn't afford to back away from new spending on programs that he said would allow the U.S. to compete with rising powers like China and India -- an approach Republicans were quick to reject as unaffordable. Mr. Obama also laid out areas of potential cooperation between the parties, such as a call to rewrite the corporate tax code.

The president answered Republican calls for steep budget cuts with a far more modest proposal to freeze a portion of government spending for five years. The bulk of his speech had larger aims: to recapture the policy initiative after his party's devastating losses in November and to inspire a nation worried about its place in a sometimes threatening global economy.

""We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world,"" Mr. Obama said in tones that resembled a halftime pep talk. ""We have to make America the best place on earth to do business.""

More than two months after what he described as his party's ""shellacking"" in midterm elections, Mr. Obama didn't appear to be on the defense. His pivot to the political center has boosted his poll ratings and captured the nation's attention. Before a national television audience, he hoped to use that attention to recapture the momentum on policy -- or at least share it with resurgent Republicans.

Among other proposals, Mr. Obama called on the nation to prepare 100,000 new math, science and engineering teachers. He used the Cold War imagery of the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite more than half a century ago to exhort a new generation to counter a new challenge: global competition.

""After investing in better research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs,"""" Mr. Obama said.

And he laid down a series of goals: By 2035, he said 80% of America's electricity should come from clean energy sources. Within 25 years, 80% of Americans should have access to high-speed rail. Within five years, communications businesses should be able to deploy high-speed wireless to 98% of all Americans. He did little to explain how those goals would be reached beyond pledges to boost federal spending on infrastructure and basic research.

Much of what the president called for to boost the nation's competitiveness are items he has pushed for two years. Many of them -- such as investments in high-speed rail, expanded Internet access and more infrastructure spending -- were central to his stimulus plan of 2009.

But in some cases, Mr. Obama pressed to move to a new level. For instance, he said he would launch a national wireless initiative to augment an earlier push for broadband Internet access in rural areas.

And he said he would use expanded tax rebates and competitive grant programs to get consumers to buy electric vehicles and help communities build the infrastructure for the next generation of clean cars. That piggybacks on the stimulus program's efforts to stimulate advanced battery production.

In the Republicans' formal response, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said his party would take the lead in shrinking government and reducing spending.

""Our nation is approaching a tipping point,"" said Mr. Ryan. ""We are at a moment, where if government's growth is left unchecked and unchallenged, America's best century will be considered our past century. This is a future in which we will transform our social safety net into a hammock, which lulls able-bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency.""

He also derided Democrats' effort to describe new spending proposals as ""investments.""

""Whether sold as 'stimulus' or repackaged as 'investment,' their actions show they want a federal government that controls too much; taxes too much; and spends too much in order to do too much,"" Mr. Ryan said.

Republicans were underwhelmed by the president's pledge to freeze spending for five years on nonsecurity, discretionary spending. Such spending is a relatively small portion of total outlays, accounting for roughly 15% of the $3.5 trillion spent by the federal government last year.

""It strikes me as too little, too late,"" said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), a member of the new Republican House leadership team. ""After this huge inflation of spending, he's willing to level-fund it. If that's his idea of fiscal responsibility, this nation is in deep trouble.""

Mr. Obama's freeze proposal in essence extends a plan for a three-year freeze that he laid out in his State of the Union speech a year ago. Even Democrats were calling for a more aggressive approach, at least in defense spending.

In urging lawmakers to rewrite corporate tax law, Mr. Obama said tax breaks should be eliminated in order to cover the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate. If Congress follows through, the process is sure to set off a lobbying scramble among businesses and could serve as a precursor to the more difficult task of rewriting tax law for individuals -- an effort that Mr. Obama also said he was willing to undertake.

White House officials said the overhaul should be revenue-neutral: neither raise additional revenue nor add to the deficit.

The president called for $8 billion a year in research and development on clean-energy technologies, a one-third increase, toward a goal of putting one million clean cars on the road by 2015. He also called for eliminating $4 billion in tax deductions to oil companies to help cover the cost of the new spending, a proposal the oil industry said was unfair and would hurt jobs.

""It is difficult to understand why we need to discriminate against our single largest form of energy at a time the nation needs additional jobs and revenue,"" said Jack Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington, D.C., trade group that represents most major oil companies.

Mr. Obama proposed his programs to a Congress where much of the political momentum is flowing toward austerity. Before the president took to the podium, the House voted to give Mr. Ryan broad new powers to cut spending quickly.

On Wednesday, a group of Senate Republicans planned to revive a push for a constitutional amendment mandating balanced budgets, an issue little heard of since the heyday of the Republican ""revolution"" of 1994.

Mr. Obama delivered only one veto threat in his State of the Union address. He said he will not sign spending bills that contain pet projects of lawmakers, known as earmarks.

Republicans have vowed to forgo earmarks, but Democrats have generally declined to join them. Banning earmarks ""takes power away from the legislative branch of government, and I think it's the wrong thing to do,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said.

Some of Mr. Obama's proposals seemed aimed at pleasing business groups. The president promised to work with Republicans on ""medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits."" He called for quick action on free-trade agreements, especially the newly completed free-trade accord with South Korea.

Mr. Obama extended an invitation to lawmakers to address Social Security's looming financial crunch, as the Baby Boom generation retires. But he made clear he would oppose dramatic changes unsuccessfully pushed by his predecessor, George W. Bush, who wanted to allow some Social Security taxes to be invested in the stock market.

Mr. Obama said he would oppose ""slashing benefits"" for future retirees, but that left open the possibility of benefit trims that budget experts in both parties believe is necessary.

The president pledged to offset his proposed spending increases with cuts elsewhere. His five-year freeze on nonsecurity domestic spending, while affecting a small part of the overall budget, would nonetheless shrink anticipated budget deficits by more than $400 billion over the next decade, said Gene Sperling, director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council.

Mr. Obama didn't detail the kind of efforts that would shrink government as much as Republicans have demanded. But he promised a reorganization of the federal government, including merging and consolidating agencies, and vowed to submit such a plan to Congress for a vote.","President Obama challenged Americans on Tuesday night to unleash their creative spirit, set aside their partisan differences and come together around a common goal of outcompeting other nations in a rapidly shifting global economy.

In a State of the Union address to a newly divided Congress, Mr. Obama outlined what he called a plan to ""win the future"" -- a blueprint for spending in critical areas like education, high-speed rail, clean-energy technology and high-speed Internet to help the United States weather the unsettling impact of globalization and the challenge from emerging powers like China and India.

""The rules have changed,"" he said.

But at the same time he proposed budget-cutting measures, including a five-year freeze in spending on some domestic programs that he said would reduce the deficit by $400 billion over 10 years.

Drawing a stark contrast between himself and Republicans, who are advocating immediate and deep cuts in spending, Mr. Obama laid out a philosophy of a government that could be more efficient but would still be necessary if the nation was to address fundamental challenges at home and abroad.

""We need to out-innovate, outeducate and outbuild the rest of the world,"" he said. ""We have to make America the best place on earth to do business. We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government. That's how our people will prosper.""

Just weeks after the shooting in Tucson that claimed six lives and left Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, gravely injured, Mr. Obama received a reception that was muted and civil.

There were no boos or a shout of ""You lie!"" as in speeches past. Many Republicans and Democrats sat side by side -- the first time anyone here can remember such mixing -- and nearly all wore black-and-white lapel ribbons in honor of the dead and injured. Ms. Giffords's colleagues held a seat open for her.

The president's speech, lasting slightly more than an hour, lacked the loft of the inspirational address he delivered in Tucson days after the shooting. But it seemed intended to elevate his presidency above the bare-knuckled legislative gamesmanship that has defined the first two years of his term.

Reaching out to Republicans who have vowed to end the pet projects known as ""earmarks,"" Mr. Obama pledged to veto any bill that contained them. He tried to defuse partisan anger over his health care measure with humor, saying he had ""heard rumors"" of concerns over the bill, and he reiterated his pledge to fix a tax provision in the measure that both parties regard as burdensome to businesses.

He drew sustained applause when he declared that colleges should open their doors to military recruiters and R.O.T.C. programs now that ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" the policy barring gay men and lesbians from serving openly, has been repealed.

And he tried to charm Republicans by weaving the new House speaker, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, into his narrative about American greatness, citing Mr. Boehner's rise from ""someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father's Cincinnati bar"" as an example of ""a country where anything is possible.""

Still, the good will lasted only so long. Moments after Mr. Obama finished speaking, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, delivered the official Republican response, in which he criticized Mr. Obama as doing too little to attack the deficit.

And Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who delivered her own Republican critique with the backing of the Tea Party wing, complained that instead of creating ""a leaner, smarter government,"" Mr. Obama had created ""a bureaucracy that tells us which light bulbs to buy.""

The president sought to use Tuesday night's address to shed the tag of big-government liberal that Republicans have placed on him, and to reclaim the mantle of a pragmatic, postpartisan leader that he used to ride to the presidency in 2008.

With one eye toward his 2012 re-election campaign, Mr. Obama offered a rosy economic vision. The president who once emphasized the problems he had inherited from his predecessor was instead looking forward and making the case that the nation had at long last emerged from economic crisis.

""Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.""

The speech was light on new policy proposals, reflecting both political and fiscal restraints on the administration after two years in which it achieved substantial legislative victories but lost the midterm elections, failed to bring the unemployment rate below 9 percent and watched the budget deficit rise sharply.

Mr. Obama did not address gun control, a hotly debated topic after the shooting in Tucson.

He did not lay out any specific plans for addressing the long-term costs of Social Security and Medicare, the biggest fiscal challenges ahead. He backed an overhaul of corporate taxes but spoke only in passing about the need to simplify the tax code for individuals. He called for legislation to address illegal immigration but provided no details.

He called for an end to subsidies for oil companies and set a goal of reducing dependence on polluting fuels over the next quarter-century, but without any mechanism to enforce it. And in a speech largely devoted to economic issues, he talked only generally about the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

As he drew a contrast between the United States and other nations, Mr. Obama gave a nod to the nation's high unemployment rate, arguing that ""the world has changed"" and that it was no longer as easy as it once was for Americans to find a good and secure job.

Government itself, he said, needs to be updated for the information age. ""We can't win the future with a government of the past,"" he said.

He packaged his message in optimistic, almost nationalistic phrasing, saying the country had always risen to challenges.

""So yes, the world has changed,"" Mr. Obama said. ""The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn't discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember, for all the hits we've taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world.""

He continued: ""No workers are more productive than ours. No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventers and entrepreneurs. We are home to the world's best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any other place on earth.""

Mr. Obama outlined initiatives in five areas: innovation; education; infrastructure; deficit reduction; and a more efficient federal bureaucracy. He pledged to increase the nation's spending on research and development, as a share of the total economy, to the highest levels since John F. Kennedy was president, and vowed to prepare an additional 100,000 science and math teachers over the next 10 years.

He proposed new efforts on high-speed rail, road and airport construction and a ""national wireless initiative"" that, administration officials said, would extend the next generation of wireless coverage to 98 percent of the population.

""Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped,"" Mr. Obama said. ""South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do. Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do. China is building faster trains and newer airports.""

Saying it was imperative for the nation to tackle its deficit, Mr. Obama reiterated his support for $78 billion in cuts to the Pentagon's budget over five years, in addition to the five-year partial freeze on domestic spending. But he did not adopt any of the recommendations of the bipartisan fiscal commission he appointed to figure out ways to bring the deficit under control.

Mr. Obama headed into the speech in surprisingly good political shape, given the drubbing Democrats took in the November elections. His job approval ratings are up -- in some polls, higher than 50 percent. The public is feeling more optimistic about the economy, voters are giving Mr. Obama credit for reaching out to Republicans in a bipartisan way, and the president won high marks for his speech in Tucson after the shooting.

""There's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause,"" Mr. Obama said Tuesday night. ""Amid all the noise and passions and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater -- something more consequential than party or political preference.""",2011-01-26,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.964, NEU: 0.035, NEG: 0.001})",0.96381676197052,0.035023387521505356,0.0011599152348935604,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.782, POS: 0.195, NEG: 0.023})","AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.577, NEU: 0.419, NEG: 0.004})",0.1947283148765564,0.7818129062652588,0.023458780720829964,0.5767350792884827,0.41917872428894043,0.004086141474545002
28,28,2011-01-31-EgyptProtests.txt,"Good evening, everybody.Â  Over the past few days, the American people have watched the situation unfolding in Egypt.Â  Weâve seen enormous demonstrations by the Egyptian people.Â  Weâve borne witness to the beginning of a new chapter in the history of a great country, and a long-time partner of the United States. And my administration has been in close contact with our Egyptian counterparts and a broad range of the Egyptian people, as well as others across the region and across the globe.Â  And throughout this period, weâve stood for a set of core principles. First, we oppose violence.Â  And I want to commend the Egyptian military for the professionalism and patriotism that it has shown thus far in allowing peaceful protests while protecting the Egyptian people.Â  Weâve seen tanks covered with banners, and soldiers and protesters embracing in the streets.Â  And going forward, I urge the military to continue its efforts to help ensure that this time of change is peaceful. Second, we stand for universal values, including the rights of the Egyptian people to freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and the freedom to access information.Â  Once more, weâve seen the incredible potential for technology to empower citizens and the dignity of those who stand up for a better future.Â  And going forward, the United States will continue to stand up for democracy and the universal rights that all human beings deserve, in Egypt and around the world. Third, we have spoken out on behalf of the need for change.Â  After his speech tonight, I spoke directly to President Mubarak.Â  He recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and that a change must take place.Â  Indeed, all of us who are privileged to serve in positions of political power do so at the will of our people.Â  Through thousands of years, Egypt has known many moments of transformation.Â  The voices of the Egyptian people tell us that this is one of those moments; this is one of those times. Now, it is not the role of any other country to determine Egyptâs leaders.Â  Only the Egyptian people can do that.Â  What is clear -- and what I indicated tonight to President Mubarak -- is my belief that an orderly transition must be meaningful, it must be peaceful, and it must begin now. Furthermore, the process must include a broad spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties.Â  It should lead to elections that are free and fair.Â  And it should result in a government thatâs not only grounded in democratic principles, but is also responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people. Throughout this process, the United States will continue to extend the hand of partnership and friendship to Egypt.Â  And we stand ready to provide any assistance that is necessary to help the Egyptian people as they manage the aftermath of these protests. Over the last few days, the passion and the dignity that has been demonstrated by the people of Egypt has been an inspiration to people around the world, including here in the United States, and to all those who believe in the inevitability of human freedom. To the people of Egypt, particularly the young people of Egypt, I want to be clear:Â  We hear your voices.Â  I have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren.Â  And I say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the United States and Egypt. There will be difficult days ahead.Â  Many questions about Egyptâs future remain unanswered.Â  But I am confident that the people of Egypt will find those answers.Â  That truth can be seen in the sense of community in the streets.Â  It can be seen in the mothers and fathers embracing soldiers.Â  And it can be seen in the Egyptians who linked arms to protect the national museum -- a new generation protecting the treasures of antiquity; a human chain connecting a great and ancient civilization to the promise of a new day. Thank you very much.","Egypt's opposition groups lined up behind a moderate leader comfortable on the world stage as their best chance to oust President Hosni Mubarak Sunday, while the nation's military closed ranks with the government leadership but allowed protests to continue raging in the streets.

The moves continued to sharpen the country's clash over whether Mr. Mubarak would resign. Events here present difficult choices for the U.S., which has been attempting to push for both the stability that the military offers and the sweeping political changes demanded by the opposition. There was no indication that the two sides would meet or hold discussions.

State television showed footage of Mr. Mubarak with his newly appointed vice president, former intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, meeting Egypt's top army commanders Sunday. The images appeared to be a bid to show that control of the armed forces was still in the hands of Mr. Mubarak and his regime.

Fragmented opposition groups, including the powerful Muslim Brotherhood, put aside sometimes strident differences to unify behind Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel peace laureate who often tangled with U.S. officials when he led the United Nations agency inspecting Iran's nuclear program. His entry in Egyptian politics is more recent. He came to Cairo last week only after the protest movement had gathered steam on its own.

Egypt's opposition groups have had a checkered past, with ideological divides and personal animosities sapping them against the might of the Mubarak regime. For now, their solidarity appears to be holding. Mr. ElBaradei's endorsement by the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest and best-organized opposition force, amounted to a historic display of unity between the country's secular and Islamist opposition forces.

The umbrella organization that organized the protests formed a steering committee on Sunday under Mr. ElBaradei to pressure the regime for more political concessions, according to senior Brotherhood leaders.

Mr. ElBaradei said in televised remarks that he looked forward to working with the military to help establish order and forge Egypt's new political future. In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, he said: ""The first step is [Mubarak] has to go. . .The second step is we have to have a government of national salvation in coordination with the army. The third step is the army has that horrible task of ensuring security."" He warned the U.S. that its failure to disavow the current government was causing it to ""lose credibility by the day.""

Public acknowledgment of the crucial role the military would play in any transition appeared to be an attempt by Mr. ElBaradei to win over a key pillar of the regime. Since a military-led coup seized power in 1952, the military has wielded considerable power, but in recent decades has kept a relatively low political profile.

The military on Sunday dramatically increased its control over security and political affairs. The army assumed control of the Ministry of the Interior, which oversees the country's internal security forces, loathed by many Egyptians for their brutality. Top army officials, including the defense minister, made appearances around the capital Sunday, meeting with troops and shaking hands with people gathered for demonstrations.

Despite the public displays of power, major question marks surrounded the Mubarak regime. It was unclear how unified the top leadership was; how deeply divisions ran within the military hierarchy; and the extent of cooperation between the military and the police force.

Mr. ElBaradei made his first appearance in the city's central Tahrir Square on Sunday evening, where tens of thousands of protesters massed. The Interior Ministry's headquarters just a few blocks away was the site a day earlier of violent clashes between protesters and what appeared to be the last vestiges of internal security forces left on the country's streets. The military appeared to come to the protesters' aid, sending four armored personnel carriers to face down police.

While U.S. officials cautiously distanced themselves from Mr. Mubarak and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for transition to a ""real democracy,"" the Egyptian military still came in for praise. ""They are acting professionally,"" said Capt. John Kirby, a spokesman for Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""They are supporting the institutions of government and that is the proper role of the military.""

The military has enjoyed broad respect among Egyptians, and appears to have gone to great lengths to avoid antagonizing citizens since deploying in the streets. But it showed no clear signs of reaching out to the opposition leadership. Military factories control significant chunks of the nation's economy, giving its leaders a vested interest in controlling the pace and extent of any political reforms.

Egypt's armed forces are the 12th largest in the world, according to the International Institute for Security Studies, and receive $1.3 billion in annual U.S. aid. One dramatic display of military might Sunday afternoon came when two F-16 jets flew over the Nile and the center of the capital.

Still, signs of disorder -- including widespread outbreaks of looting and reports of mass prison breaks from at least five different detention facilities since Friday -- threaten to erode the military's standing if it doesn't impose order. The army has yet to take firm control of the streets in the absence of the police, leaving many Egyptians worried and wondering why.

Security issues led the U.S. State department to organize emergency charters to help U.S. citizens who want to evacuate, beginning Monday. Sketchy reports have said more than 100 people have been killed during protests since Friday.

Throughout the capital, looting was a growing problem. As night fell Sunday, Cairo residents, armed with steel pipes and two-by-fours, organized neighborhood watch groups to fend off roving bands.

Many opposition leaders and analysts accused the military of allowing the chaos as part of a larger strategy to discredit popular protests.

Others believe that the military is incapable of restoring order or unwilling to jeopardize its popular standing by taking on the potentially unpopular role of a police force. State television announced that regular police forces would return to the streets Monday, but wouldn't deploy in the city's central Tahrir Square, apparently to avoid friction with protesters.","Egypt's powerful Muslim Brotherhood and the secular opposition banded together Sunday around a prominent government critic to negotiate for forces seeking the fall of President Hosni Mubarak, as the army struggled to hold a capital seized by fears of chaos and buoyed by euphoria that three decades of Mr. Mubarak's rule may be coming to an end.

The announcement that the critic, Mohamed ElBaradei, would represent a loosely unified opposition reconfigured the struggle between Mr. Mubarak's government and a six-day-old uprising bent on driving him and his party from power.

Though lacking deep support on his own, Dr. ElBaradei, a Nobel laureate and diplomat, could serve as a consensus figure for a movement that has struggled to articulate a program for a potential transition. It suggested, too, that the opposition was aware of the uprising's image abroad, putting forth a candidate who might be more acceptable to the West than beloved in Egypt.

In scenes as tumultuous as any since the uprising began, Dr. ElBaradei defied a government curfew and joined thousands of protesters in Liberation Square, a downtown landmark that has become the epicenter of the uprising and a platform, writ small, for the frustrations, ambitions and resurgent pride of a generation claiming the country's mantle.

""Today we are proud of Egyptians,"" Dr. ElBaradei told throngs who surged toward him in a square festooned with banners calling for Mr. Mubarak's fall. ""We have restored our rights, restored our freedom, and what we have begun cannot be reversed.""

Dr. ElBaradei declared it a ""new era,"" and as night fell there were few in Egypt who seemed to disagree.

Dr. ElBaradei also criticized the Obama administration, as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered the message via Sunday news programs in Washington that Mr. Mubarak should create an ""orderly transition"" to a more politically open Egypt, while she refrained from calling on him to resign. That approach, Dr. ElBaradei said, was ""a failed policy"" eroding American credibility.

""It's better for President Obama not to appear that he is the last one to say to President Mubarak, it's time for you to go,"" Dr. ElBaradei said.

The tumult Sunday seemed perched between two deepening narratives: a vision of anarchy offered by the government, and echoed by Egyptians fearing chaos, against the perspective of protesters and many others that the uprising had become what they called ""a popular revolution.""

The military, Egypt's most powerful institution and one embedded deeply in all aspects of life here, reinforced parts of the capital Sunday. It gathered as many as 100 tanks and armored carriers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the site of President Anwar el-Sadat's assassination in 1981, which brought Mr. Mubarak to power. The Interior Ministry announced it would again deploy once-ubiquitous police forces -- despised by many as the symbol of the daily humiliations of Mr. Mubarak's government -- across the country, except in Liberation Square.

In a collapse of authority, the police withdrew from major cities on Saturday, giving free rein to gangs that stole and burned cars, looted shops and ransacked a fashionable mall, where dismembered mannequins for conservative Islamic dress were strewn over broken glass and puddles of water. Thousands of inmates poured out of four prisons, including the country's most notorious, Abu Zaabal and Wadi Natroun. Checkpoints run by the military and neighborhood groups, sometimes spaced just a block apart, proliferated across Cairo and other cities.

Many have darkly suggested that the government was behind the collapse of authority as a way to justify a crackdown or discredit protesters' calls for change.

""Egypt challenges anarchy,"" a government-owned newspaper declared Sunday.

""A Conspiracy by Security to Support the Scenario of Chaos,"" replied an independent newspaper in a headline that shared space at a downtown kiosk.

The United States said it was organizing flights to evacuate its citizens on Monday, and the American Embassy urged all Americans to ""consider leaving as soon as they can safely do so,"" in a statement that underlined a deep sense of pessimism among Egypt's allies over Mr. Mubarak's fate.

Turkey, a major power in the region, said it was sending three flights to evacuate 750 of its citizens from Cairo and Alexandria.

""We're worried about the chaos, sure,"" said Selma al-Tarzi, 33, a film director who had joined friends in Liberation Square. ""But everyone is aware the chaos is generated by the government. The revolution is not generating the chaos.""

Still, driven by instances of looting -- and rumors fed by Egyptian television's unrelenting coverage of lawlessness -- it was clear that many feared the menace could worsen, and possibly undermine the protesters' demands.

""At first the words were right,"" said Abu Sayyid al-Sayyid, a driver. ""The protests were peaceful -- freedom, jobs and all that. But then the looting came and the thugs and thieves with it. Someone has to step in before there's nothing left to step into.""

For a government that long celebrated the mantra of Arab strongmen -- security and stability -- Mr. Mubarak and his officials seemed to stumble in formulating a response to the most serious challenge to his rule. Mr. Mubarak appeared on state television on Sunday in a meeting with military chiefs in what was portrayed as business as usual. Through the day, the station broadcast pledges of fealty from caller after caller.

""Behind you are 80 million people, saying yes to Mubarak!"" one declared.

That was the rarest of comments across Cairo, though, as anger grew at what residents described as treason and betrayal on the part of a reeling state.

For two days, clashes raged at Abu Zaabal, the prison north of Cairo, and officials said the police had killed at least 12 inmates there before abandoning it. On Sunday, scores of people passed in and out of the colonnaded entrance, hauling boxes and furniture through a black iron gate. Two army tanks parked nearby declined to intervene.

The Muslim Brotherhood said 34 of its members walked out of Wadi Natroun, on the road to Alexandria, after guards abandoned their posts. All had been arrested before dawn Friday, the biggest day of the protests.

""The prisoners themselves freed us from the gang who kidnapped us, this government that has become a gang,"" said Essam al-Arian, one of the Brotherhood's leaders, who had been among those held.

Since the uprising began last week, the Brotherhood has taken part in the protests but shied away from a leadership role, though that appeared to change Sunday. Mohammed el-Beltagui, a key Brotherhood leader and former Parliament member, said an alliance of the protest's more youthful leaders and older opposition figures had met again in an attempt to assemble a more unified front with a joint committee.

It included Dr. ElBaradei, along with other prominent figures like Ayman Nour and Osama al-Ghazali Harb, who have struggled to build a popular following. By far, the Brotherhood represents the most powerful force, but Mr. Beltagui and another Brotherhood official, Mohamed el-Katatni, said the group understood the implications of seeking leadership in a country still deeply divided over its religious program.

""We're supporting ElBaradei to lead the path to change,"" Mr. Beltagui said as he joined him in Liberation Square. ""The Brotherhood realizes the sensitivities, especially in the West, towards the Islamists, and we're not keen to be at the forefront.""

""We're trying to build a democratic arena before we start playing in it,"" he said.

Whether Dr. ElBaradei can emerge as that consensus figure remained unclear. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 for his work leading the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Even in Liberation Square, the crowd's reaction to Dr. ElBaradei was mixed -- some were sympathetic but many more were reserved in their support for a man who has spent much time abroad.

One Brotherhood supporter, Mohammed Fayed, an engineer, said that even if Dr. ElBaradei could replace Mr. Mubarak, he should stay no longer than a year: ""ElBaradei doesn't live here and doesn't know us. We need a leader who can understand Egyptians.""

Whatever his success, the army, long an institution shielded from criticism in the state media, was still the fulcrum of events, with a growing recognition that it would probably play the pivotal role in shaping the outcome.

In a show of authority, Mr. Mubarak was shown meeting with Defense Minister Mohammed Tantawi and Omar Suleiman, his right-hand man and the country's intelligence chief, whom he appointed as vice president on Saturday. In slogans and actions, protesters cultivated the military, too, in a bid to turn it to their side.

Military helicopters circled Liberation Square through the day, and jets roared across a late afternoon sky. But the army took no steps against the protesters, who cheered as the helicopters passed overhead. In an unprecedented scene, some of them lofted a captain in uniform on their shoulders, marching him through a square suffused with demonstrators that cut across Egypt's entrenched lines of class and religious devotion.

In contrast to the apprehension elsewhere in Cairo, a carnival atmosphere descended on the square, where vendors offered Egyptian dishes at discount prices and protesters posed for pictures beside tanks scrawled with slogans like, ""30 years of humiliation and poverty.""

""The people and the army are one hand!"" they shouted.

Across the capital, youths and some older men guarded their own neighborhoods, sometimes posting themselves at each block and alley. Several said they were in contact with the military, as well as with each other, and many residents expressed pride in the success that they had in securing their property from the threat of looters and thieves.

The sentiments captured what has become a powerful theme these days in Cairo: that Egyptians again were taking control of their destiny, against the odds.

""We know each other, we stand by each other and people respect what we're doing,"" said Ramadan Farghal, who headed one self-defense group in the poorer neighborhood of Bassateen. ""This is the Egyptian people. We used to be one hand.""",2011-01-31,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.803, NEU: 0.195, NEG: 0.002})",0.8033846020698547,0.1949346512556076,0.0016806948697194457,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.847, NEG: 0.139, POS: 0.014})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.732, NEG: 0.246, POS: 0.022})",0.014052256941795349,0.8472591638565063,0.1386885643005371,0.022332364693284035,0.7316193580627441,0.24604827165603638
29,29,2011-02-19-IntelCorp.txt,"Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you so much. I am thrilled to be here. I want to first of all thank Paul for that introduction, and I want to thank Paul for agreeing to be part of our administration's new Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. I look forward to our continuing conversations when we meet next week.

I also want to acknowledge a wonderful Governor, Governor Kitzhaber, who's here. Thank you so much for all the work that you're doing. And the mayor of Hillsboro, Jerry Willey, thank you for the great work that you do.

And I want to thank everybody here at Intel for hosting us here today. We just had a amazing tour. One of my staff, he said, ""It's like magic.""  He did. That's what he said. 

I had a chance to see everything from an electron microscope to the inside of your microprocessor facility, the clean room. And I have to say, for all the gadgets you've got here, what actually most impressed me were the students and the science projects that I just had a chance to see. It gave them a chance to talk about things like quantum ternary algorithms and it gave me a chance to nod my head and pretend that I understood what they were talking about. 

So that was the high school guys. Then we went over to seriously. Then we went over to meet some seventh graders, six girls, and it was wonderful that all girls who had started a science program after school that it involved Legos. So I'm thinking, now this is more my speed.  All right? I used to build some pretty mean Lego towers when I was a kid.  I thought I could participate. Only these students used their Legos to build models to build robots that were programmable to model brains that could repair broken bones. So I guess that's different than towers.  It's not as good the towers. 

So I couldn't be prouder of these students and all the work that they've done. And in my State of the Union Address, I said that it's not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but also the winner of science fairs. And since the Packers beat my Bears I'm reserving all my celebrating for the winners of the service fairs this year the science fairs. They deserve applause. They deserve our applause and our praise, and they make me optimistic about America's future, just as visiting this facility makes me optimistic about America's future.

I'm also I'm so proud of everybody here at Intel, not only because of what you do for these students or this community, because but because of what you do for the country. A few weeks ago, I went to the Chamber of Commerce, and I talked about the responsibility that American businesses have to create jobs and invest in this country. And there are few major companies that take this responsibility as seriously as Intel.

In 1968, Intel started as one of Silicon Valley's first startups. And as you grew in leaps and bounds in the eighties and the nineties, you experienced the competitive pressures of globalization, the changes in technology that made it cheaper for many computer companies to start hiring and manufacturing overseas. And over the years, you've done some of this yourself. And yet, by and large, Intel has placed its bets on America.

As Paul just mentioned, three-fourths of your manufacturing still happens right here in the United States. This year, you'll hire another 4,000 American workers. You'll create good construction jobs upgrading your facilities and building new plants in Arizona and right here in Oregon.

And this kind of commitment has always been part of Intel's philosophy. The founder of this company, the legendary Andy Grove, has said that he's always felt two obligations. One obligation is to your shareholders. But the other obligation is to America, because a lot of what Intel has achieved has been made possible, in Andy's words, ""by a climate of democracy, an economic climate and investment climate provided by our domicile, the United States.""

Intel's possible because of the incredible capacity of America to reinvent itself and to allow people to live out their dreams. And so the question we have to ask ourselves now is, how do we maintain this climate that Andy Grove was talking about? How do we make sure that more companies like Intel invest here, manufacture here, hire here?

In a world that is more competitive than ever before, it's our job to make sure that America is the best place on Earth to do business. Now, part of that requires knocking down barriers that stand in the way of a company's growth, which is why I've proposed lowering the corporate tax rate and eliminating unnecessary regulations. It also requires getting our fiscal house in order, which is why I've proposed a 5-year spending freeze that will reduce the deficit by $400 billion. That's a freeze that will bring our annual domestic spending to its lowest share of the economy since Eisenhower was President.

Now, to really get our deficit under control, we're going to have to do more. And I want to work with both parties to find additional savings and get rid of excessive spending wherever it exists, whether it's defense spending or health care spending or spending in the Tax Code in the form of loopholes.

But even as we have to live within our means, we can't sacrifice investments in our future. If we want the next technological breakthrough that leads to the next Intel to happen here in the United States not in China or not in Germany, but here in the United States then we have to invest in America's research and technology, in the work of our scientists and our engineers.

If we want companies like yours to be able to move goods and information quickly and cheaply, we've got to invest in communication and transportation networks, like new roads and bridges, high-speed rail, high-speed Internet.

If we want to make sure Intel doesn't have to look overseas for skilled, trained workers, then we've got to invest in our people, in our schools, in our colleges, in our children.

Basically, if we want to win the future, America has to outbuild and outinnovate and outeducate and outhustle the rest of the world. That's what we've got to do.

So today I want to focus on one component of that, and that is education. That's what I want to talk about today.

Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree. Times have changed. It used to be if you were willing to work hard, you could go to a factory, and you might be able to get a job that lasts 20 years, provide good benefits, provide decent salary. These days, those jobs are far and few between. Many of the jobs that are going to exist in the future, that exist now like the ones here at Intel require proficiency in math and science.

And yet today, as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. As we just heard Paul say, companies like Intel struggle to hire American workers who have the skills that fit their needs.

So we can't win the future if we lose the race to educate our children. Can't do it. In today's economy, the quality of a nation's education is one of the biggest predictors of a nation's success. It is what will determine whether the American Dream survives. And so it's the responsibility of all of us to get this right: parents, teachers, students, workers, business, and government. We're all going to have to focus on this like a laser.

And over the past 2 years, my administration's guiding philosophy has been that when it comes to reforming our schools, Washington shouldn't try to dictate all the answers. What we should be doing is rewarding and replicating the success of schools that have figured out a way to raise their standards and improve student performance.

And so here's what we did. Instead of pouring Federal money into a system that wasn't working, we launched a competition. We called it Race to the Top. To all 50 States we said, if you show us reforms that will lead to real results, we'll show you the money.

Race to the Top has turned out to be the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation. For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 States 40 to raise their standards for teaching and for learning. And these standards weren't developed in Washington, they were developed by Republican and Democratic Governors throughout the country.

Because we know that, other than parents, perhaps the biggest impact on a child's success comes from the man or woman who's sitting or who is standing in front of the classroom, we've also focused a lot on teaching, on teachers. We want to make teaching an honored profession in our society. We want to reward good teachers. We want to stop making excuses for bad teachers. And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, fields that will give the students the skills they need for the jobs that exist in places like Intel.

To ensure that higher education is within the reach of every American, we've extended we put an end to unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that used to go to banks, and we put the savings towards making college more affordable for millions of students. And this year, we want to make permanent our tuition tax credit, which is worth $10,000 for 4 years of college.

And finally, to make sure anyone can get trained and prepared for whatever career they pursue, we want to revitalize America's community colleges. Not everybody needs to go to a 4-year college. And so we've launched a nationwide initiative to connect graduates that need a job with businesses that need their skills.

And we've drawn lessons from Intel's experience. For years, Intel has recognized the value of these kinds of partnerships between schools and businesses. This company understands that your success depends on a pipeline of skilled workers who are ready to fill high-tech jobs.

And so over the last decade, you've invested $50 million to support education in the State of Oregon. You've started programs [Applause]. That's worth applause. You've started programs that get kids interested in engineering and technology as early as elementary school, like those six girls that I met. You've sponsored mentoring and engineering competitions for poor and underserved high school students. Your employer your employees volunteer some of you probably here have volunteered as tutors in nearby schools and universities. You've helped train 7,000 Oregon teachers over the last 10 years.

Your science fairs, your talent searches are some of the largest and most prestigious in the world, producing multiple Nobel Prize winners. And I expect some of the students I met will qualify soon. 

And we were so grateful that Intel was one of the four companies that initially joined our administration's nationwide campaign to boost math and science education here in America, as part of a new organization called Change the Equation.

So you guys have been pretty busy here at Intel.  You've given countless students the chance to succeed, and for that you should be very proud. But you're not just a good corporate role model. You're a corporation who understands that investing in education is also a good business model. It's good for the bottom line.

A lot of your employees were engineering undergraduates at Oregon State or Portland State, right? How many Beavers here, by the way? You know my brother-in-law's the coach there.  Just wanted to point that out. They're a young team, but they're on the move. 

But here's what we know: If you can spark a student's interest in math or science, who would have otherwise dropped out, you might not just change a child's life, you may nurture the talent that one day discovers the breakthrough that changes this industry forever.

In fact, before I came here, I read a story about a young University of Oregon graduate. His name is Nabil Mistkawi, and he joined Intel as an engineer in 1993. After working with so many other employees who had doctorate degrees, Nabil decided to go back to school and get his Ph.D. in chemistry at Portland State University. And thanks to Intel, he was able to pay for his degree and keep his full-time job.

Now, during that time, Intel was trying to find a faster, more efficient way to process their microchips, but nobody could figure it out. And they asked at least eight other companies and research labs for help. Some said it couldn't be done. Others worked on it for nearly a year with no success. And so they asked Nabil if he wanted to give it a shot.

Within 3 days 3 days he came up with a solution that is now saving this company millions of dollars a year. And I will not embarrass myself by trying to explain what his answer was and most of you probably know how it works anyway.  The point is, an investment in education paid off in a big way: for Nabil, for Intel, for the millions of workers and consumers who benefited from that discovery.

So for all the daunting statistics about our educational failings as a nation, for all the naysayers predicting America's decline you've been hearing them lately stories like this give me hope. Stories like these give me confidence that America will win the future. We know what works. We know how to succeed. We know how to do big things. And all across this Nation, in places just like this one, we have students and teachers, local leaders and companies, who are working together to make it happen.

When it comes to competing with other nations for the jobs and industries of the future, we are all on the same team: the American team. And if we start rowing in the same direction, I promise you, there is nothing that we cannot achieve. That's what you're proving here at Intel. That's what you're proving in the schools and colleges of this State. That's what America will prove in the months and years ahead.

Thank you, guys. God bless you.
","Intel Corp. used President Obama's visit to disclose plans to build a $5 billion chip factory in Arizona and hire 4,000 workers, moves that dovetail with the administration's job-creation agenda.

The move, made by Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini as the president toured Intel's operations in Oregon, is the latest investment by the Silicon Valley giant to help boost the output and performance of its chips.

President Obama's trip west to meet with high-tech leaders comes amid a looming budget fight in Washington and corporate opposition to some of the president's policies.

On Thursday, Mr. Obama had a dinner near San Francisco with a dozen high-tech CEOs, including Apple Inc.'s Steve Jobs, Facebook Inc.'s Mark Zuckerberg, Google Inc.'s Eric Schmidt and Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison. The White House said topics included research and exports, and the president's incentives for companies to grow and hire.

Mr. Otellini hasn't been shy about criticizing the administration; Intel has expressed concerns about the high cost of doing business in the U.S. and the possible impact of proposed greenhouse gas regulation.

Yet the White House on Friday said Mr. Otellini will join the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. And on Friday Intel's chief echoed many of the president's recent statements about the need to rebuild U.S. competitiveness against foreign rivals and invest in research, manufacturing and education.

""The best way forward for us is to unleash the unmatched creative energies of the people of this country to transform our manufacturing base,"" Mr. Otellini said. ""Intel is proud to do its part.""

As Mr. Otellini spoke, a screen behind him shimmered with alternating slogans that included ""Intel, Made in America,"" ""Invented in America"" and ""Designed in America.""

The Santa Clara, Calif., company stresses it sells most of its chips abroad but fabricates most of them in America. Mr. Otellini and his predecessors have been vocal about the need for a better-educated U.S. workforce, a theme the president amplified.

""Many of the jobs that are going to exist in the future, that exist now -- like the ones here at Intel -- require proficiency in math and science,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And yet today as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school.""

Intel had signaled a new factory was needed, and in mid-January boosted its capital spending forecast for 2011 to $9 billion from $5.2 billion in 2010.

Chandler, Ariz., is already home to one of the company's biggest production sites. The new project will lead to thousands of construction and permanent manufacturing jobs, Intel said. Construction is expected to begin this year and be completed in 2013, Intel said.","The Intel Corporation announced plans on Friday to build a $5 billion microprocessor plant in Arizona and hire 4,000 employees in the United States this year.

30,30,2011-05-02-binLadenKilled.txt,"Good evening. Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist whoâs responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.

It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history. The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory -- hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky; the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground; black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon; the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction.

And yet we know that the worst images are those that were unseen to the world. The empty seat at the dinner table. Children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father. Parents who would never know the feeling of their childâs embrace. Nearly 3,000 citizens taken from us, leaving a gaping hole in our hearts.

On September 11, 2001, in our time of grief, the American people came together. We offered our neighbors a hand, and we offered the wounded our blood.  We reaffirmed our ties to each other, and our love of community and country. On that day, no matter where we came from, what God we prayed to, or what race or ethnicity we were, we were united as one American family.

We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice. We quickly learned that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by al Qaeda -- an organization headed by Osama bin Laden, which had openly declared war on the United States and was committed to killing innocents in our country and around the globe. And so we went to war against al Qaeda to protect our citizens, our friends, and our allies.

Over the last 10 years, thanks to the tireless and heroic work of our military and our counterterrorism professionals, weâve made great strides in that effort. Weâve disrupted terrorist attacks and strengthened our homeland defense. In Afghanistan, we removed the Taliban government, which had given bin Laden and al Qaeda safe haven and support. And around the globe, we worked with our friends and allies to capture or kill scores of al Qaeda terrorists, including several who were a part of the 9/11 plot.

Yet Osama bin Laden avoided capture and escaped across the Afghan border into Pakistan. Meanwhile, al Qaeda continued to operate from along that border and operate through its affiliates across the world. And so shortly after taking office, I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al Qaeda, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network.

Then, last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden. It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground. I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside of Pakistan. And finally, last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.

Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.

For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaedaâs leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nationâs effort to defeat al Qaeda.

Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort. Thereâs no doubt that al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must â- and we will -- remain vigilant at home and abroad.

As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not â- and never will be -â at war with Islam. Iâve made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam. Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims. Indeed, al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own.  So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.

Over the years, Iâve repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was. That is what weâve done. But itâs important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding. Indeed, bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well, and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people.

Tonight, I called President Zardari, and my team has also spoken with their Pakistani counterparts. They agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations. And going forward, it is essential that Pakistan continue to join us in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates.

The American people did not choose this fight. It came to our shores, and started with the senseless slaughter of our citizens. After nearly 10 years of service, struggle, and sacrifice, we know well the costs of war. These efforts weigh on me every time I, as Commander-in-Chief, have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one, or look into the eyes of a service member whoâs been gravely wounded.

So Americans understand the costs of war. Yet as a country, we will never tolerate our security being threatened, nor stand idly by when our people have been killed. We will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies. We will be true to the values that make us who we are. And on nights like this one, we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to al Qaedaâs terror: Justice has been done.

Tonight, we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals whoâve worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome. The American people do not see their work, nor know their names. But tonight, they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice.

We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism, and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country. And they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of the burden since that September day.

Finally, let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 that we have never forgotten your loss, nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores. 

And tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11. I know that it has, at times, frayed. Yet todayâs achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people. 

The cause of securing our country is not complete. But tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to.  That is the story of our history, whether itâs the pursuit of prosperity for our people, or the struggle for equality for all our citizens; our commitment to stand up for our values abroad, and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place. 

Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power, but because of who we are: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Thank you.

May God bless you.

And may God bless the United States of America.
","Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, a mastermind of the largest terrorist attack in American history, was killed Sunday in Pakistan in a military operation after the U.S. learned of his location.

The death capped a manhunt of a decade for the architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that left nearly 3,000 people dead and dramatically altered U.S. foreign policy and the nation's sense of security.

""Justice has been done,"" President Barack Obama said from the White House, where he made the dramatic announcement late Sunday. ""The United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda and a terrorist who is responsible for the murder of thousands of men, women and children.""

He said that he had ordered the attack earlier in the day after it became clear last week that there was sufficient intelligence, following a lead about his whereabouts that first surfaced in August. He said the U.S. has Mr. bin Laden's body in its possession.

Hundreds of onlookers gathered outside the White House -- and at Ground Zero in New York City, where the twin towers of the World Trade Center once stood -- to mark the moment. Frank Cantwell, a 64-year-old operating engineer at the construction site there, said there were only a few people present when the news first broke. ""It's long overdue,"" he said. ""You can sort of hear the silent cheers of 3,000 ghosts.""

The elusive al Qaeda leader was killed in a targeted assault in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, roughly 40 miles outside the capital city of Islamabad. The raid was conducted by a small helicopter-borne strike team, a senior U.S. administration official said. The team was on the compound for under 40 minutes, the official said.

In addition to Mr. bin Laden, three men were killed in the raid. The U.S. believes that two of them were the couriers and the third was Mr. bin Laden's adult son. A woman was also killed during the raid when she was used as a ""shield"" by one of the men in the compound. Two other women were injured.

During the raid, one of the U.S. helicopters malfunctioned and went down. The helicopter was destroyed by the crew and the assault force and crew members left the compound in a second helicopter, the senior administration official said.

Omar Khan, a local resident in the area of the attack, said American and Pakistani commandos landed in the area at 1:10 a.m., local time, and raided a house. ""The entire area was rocked with a massive explosion,"" he said. ""A massive exchange of firing took place which continued for more than half an hour."" Security forces have cordoned off the area.

Mr. bin Laden's death is a major milestone for the U.S., but its precise effects on the battle against terrorism are unclear. Although Mr. bin Laden is the inspirational leader of al Qaeda and its offshoots around the world, he isn't thought to be a critical operational leader of the organization. Increasingly, terrorist actions have been undertaken by offshoots of his organization.

Still, Mr. bin Laden remained the worldwide symbol of the terrorist network and militant Islam more broadly. His death will be a major blow to al Qaeda, and one that makes the organization look less powerful.

""Taliban fighters have an admiration for Osama. It will affect their morale"" and trigger retaliatory attacks, a Taliban commander in Paktia province in Afghanistan said in a phone interview.

The Associated Press said late Sunday that the U.S. had put its embassies on alert and was warning Americans of possible reprisal attacks following Mr. bin Laden's death.

Mr. Obama said he was first briefed on a possible lead on Mr. bin Laden's whereabouts last August. ""It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground,"" Mr. Obama said in his address to the nation Sunday night.

Mr. Obama said he met repeatedly with his national security team ""as we developed more information about the possibility that we have located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside Pakistan.""

Last week, there was enough intelligence to take action. On Sunday, he ordered what he described as a targeted operation against a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. No Americans were hurt in the raid, Mr. Obama said, and the team took pains to avoid civilian casualties. Mr. Obama stressed that Pakistan's help was critical to developing intelligence on his location.

Mr. Obama called his predecessors in office, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, before speaking to the nation, a senior administration official said.

Because Mr. bin Laden was such an elusive figure, his death is a significant achievement for President Obama, who demanded an aggressive expansion of Predator strikes in Pakistan and pushed for expanded special operations training in that country as well.

The strike also has the potential to make already tense relations with Pakistan even more strained. Having vastly ramped up intelligence efforts on the ground and from the air in Pakistan, the U.S. carries out the strikes with little input from the Pakistanis.

The CIA has launched more than 200 drone strikes since it was ramped up in 2008. The bulk of those strikes have been launched under President Obama, who was an early convert to the covert program, which has killed 1,200 militants.

In recent months relations with Pakistan have grown tense, but the drone program has continued. CIA director Leon Panetta met on April 11 with Pakistan's intelligence chief Ahmad Shuja Pasha, and continued to receive private agreement allowing the U.S. to launch drone strikes.

After the news of Mr. bin Laden's death became public, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari called an emergency meeting and security around Islamabad was tightened.

There was a mix of somberness of and celebration near Ground Zero, where a new tower is rapidly becoming part of the city's skyline. Cheers rang out and horns honked, while others lit candles at a memorial at the site.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement, ""New Yorkers have waited nearly 10 years for this news. It is my hope that it will bring some closure and comfort to all those who lost loved ones on Sept. 11, 2001.""

Jane Pollicino of Plainview, N.Y., whose husband, Steve, died in the attack on the World Trade Center, said, ""It makes it all real again. You carry on day by day, hoping that the government is trying to get this person. But it has been 10 years. ""You get a sense of relief,"" she said, her voice shaking. ""But it brings it all back to the surface.""","Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the most devastating attack on American soil in modern times and the most hunted man in the world, was killed in a firefight with United States forces in Pakistan on Sunday, President Obama announced.

In a dramatic late-night appearance in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Obama declared that ""justice has been done"" as he disclosed that American military and C.I.A. operatives had finally cornered bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader who had eluded them for nearly a decade. American officials said bin Laden resisted and was shot in the head. He was later buried at sea.

The news touched off an extraordinary outpouring of emotion as crowds gathered outside the White House, in Times Square and at the Ground Zero site, waving American flags, cheering, shouting, laughing and chanting, ""USA, USA!"" In New York City, crowds sang the Star-Spangled Banner. Throughout downtown Washington, drivers honked horns deep into the night.

""For over two decades, bin Laden has been Al Qaeda's leader and symbol,"" the president said in a statement televised around the world. ""The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda. But his death does not mark the end of our effort. There's no doubt that Al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.""

Bin Laden's demise is a defining moment in the American-led war on terrorism, a symbolic stroke affirming the relentlessness of the pursuit of those who attacked New York and Washington on Sept. 11, 2001. What remains to be seen, however, is whether it galvanizes his followers by turning him into a martyr or serves as a turning of the page in the war in Afghanistan and gives further impetus to Mr. Obama to bring American troops home.How much his death will affect Al Qaeda itself remains unclear. For years, as they failed to find him, American leaders have said he was more symbolically important than operationally significant because he was on the run and hindered in any meaningful leadership role. And yet, he remained the most potent face of terrorism around the world and some of those who downplayed his role in recent years nonetheless celebrated his death.

Given Bin Laden's status among radicals, the American government braced for possible retaliation. A senior Pentagon official said late Sunday that military bases in the United States and around the world were ordered to a higher state of readiness. The State Department issued a worldwide travel warning, urging Americans in volatile areas ""to limit their travel outside of their homes and hotels and avoid mass gatherings and demonstrations.""

The strike could exacerbate deep tensions with Pakistan, which has periodically bristled at American efforts even as Bin Laden evidently found safe refuge on its territory for nearly a decade. Since taking office, Mr. Obama has ordered significantly more unmanned drone strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, stirring public anger and prompting the Pakistani government to protest.

When the end came for bin Laden, he was found not in the remote tribal areas along the Pakistani-Afghan border where he has long been presumed to be sheltered, but in a massive compound about an hour's drive north from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. He was hiding in the medium-sized city of Abbottabad, home to a large Pakistani military base and a military academy of the Pakistani army.

The house at the end of a narrow dirt road was roughly eight times larger than other homes in the area, but had no telephone or television connections. When American operatives converged on the house on Sunday, bin Laden ""resisted the assault force"" and was killed in the middle of an intense gun battle, a senior administration official said, but details were still sketchy early Monday morning.

The fate of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Al Qaeda second-in-command, was unclear Sunday night.

The official said that military and intelligence officials first learned last summer that a ""high-value target"" was being protected in the compound and began working on a plan for going in to get him. Beginning in March, Mr. Obama presided over five national security meetings at the White House to go over plans for the operation and on Friday morning, just before leaving Washington to tour tornado damage in Alabama, gave the final order for special forces and C.I.A. operatives to strike.

Mr. Obama called it a ""targeted operation,"" and added: ""No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.""

Bin Laden's death came nearly 10 years after Al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four American passenger jets, crashing three of them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon outside Washington. The fourth hijacked jet, United Flight 93, crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside after passengers fought the militants.

""This is important news for us, and for the world,"" said Gordon Felt, president of the group Families of Flight 93. ""It cannot ease our pain, or bring back our loved ones. It does bring a measure of comfort that the mastermind of the September 11th tragedy and the face of global terror can no longer spread his evil.""

The mostly young people who celebrated in the streets of New York and Washington saw it as a historic moment, one that for many of them culminated a worldwide manhunt that started when they were children.

Some climbed trees and lampposts directly in front of the White House to cheer and wave flags. Cigars and noisemakers were common. One group started singing, ""Osama, Osama, hey, hey, hey, good bye.""

Maureen Hasson, 22, a recent college graduate working for the Justice Department, came down to Lafayette Square in a fushia party dress and flip-flops. ""This is full circle for our generation,"" she said. ""Just look around at the average age here. We were all in middle school when the terrorists struck. We all vividly remember 9/11 and this is the close of that chapter.""

Sam Sherman, 18, a freshman at George Washington University originally from New York, also rushed down to the White House. ""The feeling you can't even imagine, the feeling in the air. ""It's crazy,"" he said. ""I have friends with parents dead because of Osama bin Laden's plan, okay? So when I heard this news, I was coming down to celebrate.""

Mr. Obama said Pakistan had helped develop the intelligence that led to Bin Laden, but an American official said Islamabad was not informed about the strike in advance. ""We shared our intelligence on this compound with no other country, including Pakistan,"" the official said.

Mr. Obama recalled his statements in the 2008 presidential campaign when he vowed to order American forces to strike inside Pakistan if necessary even without Islamabad's permission. ""That is what we've done,"" he said. ""But it's important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding.""

Relations with Pakistan had fallen in recent weeks to their lowest point in years. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly criticized the Pakistani military two weeks ago for failing to act against extremists allied to Al Qaeda who shelter in the tribal areas of North Waziristan. Last week, Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, head of the Pakistani army, said Pakistan had broken the back of terrorism on its territory, prompting skepticism in Washington.

Mr. Obama called President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan to tell him about the strike after it was underway and his advisers called their Pakistani counterparts. ""They agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations,"" Mr. Obama said.

The city of Abbottabad where Bin Laden was found has had other known Al Qaeda presence in the past. A senior Indonesian militant, Umar Patek, was arrested there earlier this year. Mr. Patek was protected by a Qaeda operative, a postal clerk who worked under cover at the main post office, a signal that Al Qaeda may have had other operations in the area.

As the operation's start approached, many American officials posted at the United States consulate in Peshawar, the capital of the north west area of Pakistan, were told suddenly to depart last Friday, leaving behind only a core group of essential staff. The American officials said they had been told to leave because of fears of kidnapping but were not tipped off to the operation.

Analysts said Bin Laden's death amounted to a double blow for Al Qaeda, after its sermons of anti-Western violence seemed to be rendered irrelevant by the wave of political upheaval rolling through the Arab world.

""It comes at a time when Al Qaeda's narrative is already very much in doubt in the Arab world,"" said Martin S. Indyk, vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. ""Its narrative was that violence was the way to redeem Arab honor and dignity. But Osama bin Laden and his violence didn't succeed in unseating anybody.""

Al Qaeda sympathizers reacted with disbelief, anger and in some cases talk of retribution. On a web site considered an outlet for Al Qaeda messages, forum administrators deleted posts by users announcing Bin Laden's death and demanded that members wait until the news was confirmed by Al Qaeda sources, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, an organization that monitors radicals.

Even so, SITE said, sympathizers on the forum posted messages calling Bin Laden a martyr and suggesting retaliation. ""America will reap the same if the news is true and false,"" said one message. ""The lions will remain lions and will continue moving in the footsteps of Usama,"" said another, using an alternate spelling of Bin Laden's name.

In the United States, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy organization, said it welcomed Bin Laden's death. ""As we have stated repeatedly since the 9/11 terror attacks, Bin Laden never represented Muslims or Islam,"" the group said in a statement. ""In fact, in addition to the killing of thousands of Americans, he and Al Qaeda caused the deaths of countless Muslims worldwide.""

""This momentous achievement marks a victory for America, for people who seek peace around the world, and for all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001,"" former President George W. Bush, who launched the war against Al Qaeda after Sept. 11 and called for Bin Laden to be caught ""dead or alive,"" said in a statement. ""The fight against terror goes on, but tonight America has sent an unmistakable message: No matter how long it takes, justice will be done.""

Mr. Obama used similar language and warned that the war against terrorists has not ended. ""We will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies. We will be true to the values that make us who we are. And on nights like this one, we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to Al Qaeda's terror, justice has been done.""

The president was careful to add that, as Mr. Bush did during his presidency, the United States is not at war with Islam. ""Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Indeed, Al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own. So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.""",2011-05-02,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.962, NEU: 0.035, POS: 0.003})",0.0033447840251028538,0.0345044806599617,0.9621506929397583,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.918, NEU: 0.080, POS: 0.003})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.500, NEG: 0.485, POS: 0.015})",0.0028633454348891973,0.07953345775604248,0.9176032543182373,0.015099539421498775,0.5000764727592468,0.48482394218444824
31,31,2011-05-23-MissouriTornado.txt,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so much. Please, please be seated.

Thank you, Governor, for that powerful message, but more importantly, for being here with and for your people every step of the way.

We are grateful to you, to Reverend Gariss, Father Monaghan. Iâm so glad you got in that tub. To Reverend Brown for that incredibly powerful message.

To Senator Claire McCaskill, whoâs been here, and Congressman Billy Long; Mayor Woolston. To Craig Fugate. It doesnât get a lot of attention, but he heads up FEMA, our emergency response at the federal level. Heâs been going from Tuscaloosa to Joplin and everywhere in between tirelessly doing outstanding work. Weâre grateful for him. Gail McGovern, the President of the National Red Cross, which has contributed mightily to the rebuilding efforts here.

Most of all, to the family and friends of all those whoâve been lost and all those whoâve been affected.

Today we gather to celebrate the lives of those weâve lost to the storms here in Joplin and across the Midwest, to keep in our prayers those still missing, to mourn with their families, to stand together during this time of pain and trial.

And as Reverend Brown alluded to, the question that weighs on us at a time like this is: Why? Why our town? Why our home? Why my son, or husband, or wife, or sister, or friend? Why?

We do not have the capacity to answer. We canât know when a terrible storm will strike, or where, or the severity of the devastation that it may cause. We canât know why weâre tested with the loss of a loved one, or the loss of a home where weâve lived a lifetime.

These things are beyond our power to control. But that does not mean we are powerless in the face of adversity. How we respond when the storm strikes is up to us. How we live in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache, thatâs within our control. And itâs in these moments, through our actions, that we often see the glimpse of what makes life worth living in the first place.

In the last week, thatâs what Joplin has not just taught Missouri, not just taught America, but has taught the world. I was overseas in the aftermath of the storm, and had world leaders coming up to me saying, let the people of Joplin know we are with them; weâre thinking about them; we love them.

Because the world saw how Joplin responded. A university turned itself into a makeshift hospital. Some of you used your pickup trucks as ambulances, carrying the injured -- on doors that served as stretchers. Your restaurants have rushed food to people in need. Businesses have filled trucks with donations. Youâve waited in line for hours to donate blood to people you know, but also to people youâve never met.  And in all this, you have lived the words of Scripture:

    We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;
    we are perplexed, but not in despair;
    Persecuted, but not forsaken;
    cast down, but not destroyed....

As the governor said, you have shown the world what it means to love thy neighbor. Youâve banded together. Youâve come to each otherâs aid. Youâve demonstrated a simple truth: that amid heartbreak and tragedy, no one is a stranger. Everybody is a brother. Everybody is a sister. We can all love one another.

As you move forward in the days ahead, I know that rebuilding what youâve lost wonât be easy. I just walked through some of the neighborhoods that have been affected, and you look out at the landscape, and there have to be moments where you just say, where to begin? How to start? There are going to be moments where after the shock has worn off, you feel alone. But thereâs no doubt in my mind what the people of this community can do. Thereâs no doubt in my mind that Joplin will rebuild.  And as President, I can promise you your country will be there with you every single step of the way. We will be with you every step of the way. Weâre not going anywhere. The cameras may leave. The spotlight may shift. But we will be with you every step of the way until Joplin is restored and this community is back on its feet. Weâre not going anywhere.

That is not just my promise; thatâs Americaâs promise. Itâs a promise I make here in Joplin; itâs a promise I made down in Tuscaloosa, or in any of the communities that have been hit by these devastating storms over the last few weeks.

Now, there have been countless acts of kindness and selflessness in recent days.  Weâve already heard the record of some of that. But perhaps none are as inspiring as what took place when the storm was bearing down on Joplin, threatening an entire community with utter destruction. And in the face of winds that showed no mercy, no regard for human life, that did not discriminate by race or faith or background, it was ordinary people, swiftly tested, who said, âIâm willing to die right now so that someone else might live.â

It was the husband who threw himself over his wife as their house came apart around them.  It was the mother who shielded her young son.
 
It was Dean Wells, a husband and father who loved to sing and whistle in his church choir. Dean was working a shift at the Home Depot, managing the electrical department, when the siren rang out. He sprang into action, moving people to safety. Over and over again, he went back for others, until a wall came down on top of him.  In the end, most of the building was destroyed, but not where Dean had directed his coworkers and his customers.
 
There was a young man named Christopher Lucas who was 26 years old. Father of two daughters; third daughter on the way. Just like any other night, Christopher was doing his job as manager on duty at Pizza Hut. And then he heard the storm coming.

It was then when this former sailor quickly ushered everybody into the walk-in freezer. The only problem was, the freezer door wouldnât stay closed from the inside. So as the tornado bore down on this small storefront on Range Line Road, Christopher left the freezer to find a rope or a cord or anything to hold the door shut. He made it back just in time, tying a piece of bungee cord to the handle outside, wrapping the other end around his arm, holding the door closed with all his might. 
 
And Christopher held it as long as he could, until he was pulled away by the incredible force of the storm. He died saving more than a dozen people in that freezer.

You see, there are heroes all around us, all the time. They walk by us on the sidewalk, and they sit next to us in class. They pass us in the aisle wearing an orange apron. They come to our table at a restaurant and ask us what weâd like to order.

Just as we canât know why tragedy strikes in the first place, we may never fully understand where these men and women find the courage and strength to do what they did. What we do know is that in a split-second moment where thereâs little time for internal reflection or debate, the actions of these individuals were driven by love -- love for a family member, love for a friend, or just love for a fellow human being.

Thatâs good to know. In a world that can be cruel and selfish, itâs this knowledge -- the knowledge that we are inclined to love one another, that weâre inclined to do good, to be good -- that causes us to take heart. We see with fresh eyes whatâs precious and so fragile and so important to us. We put aside our petty grievances and our minor disagreements. We see ourselves in the hopes and hardships of others. And in the stories of people like Dean and people like Christopher, we remember that each us contains reserves of resolve and compassion. There are heroes all around us, all the time.

And so, in the wake of this tragedy, let us live up to their example -- to make each day count -- to live with the sense of mutual regard -- to live with that same compassion that they demonstrated in their final hours. We are called by them to do everything we can to be worthy of the chance that weâve been given to carry on.

I understand that at a memorial yesterday for Dean, his wife decided to play a recording of Dean whistling a song he loved -- Amazing Grace. The lyrics are a fitting tribute to what Joplin has been through.

    Through many dangers, toils and snares
    I have already come;
    'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
    and Grace will lead me homeâ¦

    Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
    And mortal life shall cease,
    I shall possess within the veil,
    A life of joy and peace.

May those weâve lost know peace, and may Grace guide the people of Joplin home.

God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

Thank you.
","The deadliest U.S. tornado in nearly six decades ripped through this southwest Missouri city, leveling schools, businesses and churches and killing at least 116 people.

Rescue workers Monday searched for survivors of a twister more than half a mile wide that roared through here Sunday evening at wind speeds above 190 mph.

""It is utter chaos,"" City Councilwoman and Vice Mayor Melodee Colbert-Kean said Monday as thunderstorms pelted the city with rain and hail.

The tornado destroyed about 2,000 buildings and damaged roughly a third of the city, including a major hospital, said local and state officials. The death toll is the highest since 116 people died in a tornado in Flint, Mich., in 1953, the National Weather Service said. In Joplin, a city of 50,000, some 500 were injured. Tornadoes over the weekend also were blamed for a death in Minneapolis and one in Reading, Kan.

Search teams in Joplin rescued 17 people trapped Monday in various locations, including one at a Home Depot, according to the Associated Press. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and said he is ""optimistic that there are still lives out there to be saved.""

Across Joplin's south side, churches, schools, businesses and homes were reduced to rubble. Road signs beside Interstate 44 near the city were bent backward or torn from the ground.

Uprooted trees, overturned cars, power wires, furniture and other debris littered roads, while leaks from ruptured gas lines sparked fires. ""You feel numb,"" said Theresa Burrell, 50, a casino cashier sorting through debris in front of her home. Her house was mostly intact, with an empty space atop her front porch. ""This is where my balcony used to be,"" she said.

The tornado sheared the roof off the nine-story St. John's Regional Medical Center. Staffers had just a few moments to hustle patients into hallways before the storm blew out windows and rendered the facility useless. Five patients and a visitor to the center died, officials said.

City councilwoman Trisha Raney was in the emergency room there with her grandmother, who had been complaining of panic attacks, when the twister struck. ""The ceiling was raining on us,"" Ms. Raney said. Police escorted uninjured people from the hospital. Outside, they saw buildings reduced to shards. ""You couldn't recognize where you were,"" Ms. Raney said.

About two blocks away, damage was far less extensive at Freeman West Medical Center. But staff there described a long night after the twister hit, as hundreds of people either walked injured to the hospital or arrived in private cars. At one point, the staff sorted through 400 people in the lobby. They sent about 60 patients to hospitals outside Joplin.

Authorities were conducting a door-to-door search. ""Some houses where we're picking up bodies are just completely gone,"" said Newton County Coroner Mark Bridges. ""Stuff's stacked on top of stuff, and it's going to take time to dig down.""

He said some deaths were reported at a Wal-Mart and he expects bodies to be recovered from nearby building-supply stores and restaurants.

The twister in Missouri was one of 68 reported across seven Midwest states over the weekend, according to the weather service. The Joplin disaster extended a season of tornadoes and flooding that has staggered communities in the country's midsection from Minnesota to Mississippi, killing hundreds and forcing thousands from homes.

In Joplin, tornado sirens began sounding at 5:17 p.m. local time. The tornado touched down 24 minutes later, said Jack Hayes, director of the National Weather Service. City Manager Mark Rohr said the cyclone cut a path nearly six miles long.

David Hinkle, a 20-year-old freshman at Missouri Southern State University in Joplin, said he heard the sirens and that he and a friend drove to see the funnel cloud, but they eventually steered into a highway ditch for cover. They saw one man get out of his car and crawl into the ditch near their car. As the twister's roar grew, the man began pounding on Mr. Hinkle's door, begging to be let inside.

Mr. Hinkle said his friend refused to unlock the car because she was afraid that the wind would rip off the door. ""I wanted to let him in so bad, but we just couldn't,"" he said. Around that time, a tractor-trailer that had been parked on the other side of the road tipped over and was dragged by the wind across two lanes of traffic, stopping a few feet from falling into the ditch onto Mr. Hinkle's car.

When calm returned, Mr. Hinkle said they let the man inside -- all three of them were unhurt -- and began checking on others nearby. ""I thought I was going to die, he said, trembling as he spoke at a Red Cross shelter, where he has been volunteering. ""We were so close.""","A tornado steamrolled over Joplin, Mo., on Sunday night, knocking out a hospital and causing many deaths across the city, according to various reports.

Joplin, which the reports said was in the direct path of the tornado, was left isolated and in the dark after the destruction, with telephone connections largely cut off and many homes without electricity after the twister touched down around 6 p.m.

Reuters quoted the Newton County coroner, Mark Bridges, as saying about 30 people had been killed, and 11 bodies had been recovered from just one location.

A major hospital in town, St. John's Regional Medical Center, had to be abandoned, witnesses said, and the triage unit set up on its grounds to care for the patients had to be temporarily moved across the street when the hospital caught fire.

The tornado was just the latest in a string of deadly twisters that have killed hundreds of people in recent months, with Tuscaloosa, Ala., still recovering from one that also tore through the center of the city in late April.

Initial reports from Joplin said that schools, apartment buildings, megastores and fire stations were ravaged by the tornado.

""There was panic -- firefighters were pulling themselves out of the debris and then helping others,"" said Mike Bettes, a meteorologist for the Weather Channel who arrived in Joplin 10 minutes after the tornado touched down, as part of the show ""The Great Tornado Hunt.""

Hours later, he said, the scene was ""very serene -- dark, relatively quiet."" He and his Weather Channel crew had set up to report from the hospital grounds, he said in a telephone interview, and ""we are on a hill and the only lights we see are on the fire trucks or ambulances.""

Joplin's was by far the worst damage on a day of brutal storms in the Midwest, including a tornado in Minneapolis that city officials said left one person dead and dozens injured in an area that covered several blocks. By Sunday night, Missouri's governor, Jay Nixon, had already activated the National Guard and declared a state of emergency.

President Obama said the Federal Emergency Management Agency was being sent.

""FEMA is working with the affected area's state and local officials to support response and recovery efforts, and the federal government stands ready to help our fellow Americans as needed,"" Mr. Obama said.

Weather experts were still trying to assess exactly what had produced such damage. ""The power lines have gone down -- we can't reach anyone there,"" Bill Davis, a meteorologist at the Springfield, Mo., office of the National Weather Service, said in a telephone interview. He said any assessment of exactly how strong the tornado was would have to wait until tomorrow, when experts would drive to Joplin. However, he said, on a scale from 1 to 10, the tornado looked to be ""on the 8-9 level.""

He compared it to a tornado that struck in May 2008 and left a dozen dead in the same part of Missouri. ""It very much looked like that supercell,"" he said, though that storm managed to spare Joplin a direct hit.

Joplin, a city of about 49,000 people, sits at the edge of the Ozark Mountain region.

Mr. Bettes, the meteorologist, said that the storm that hit Joplin had been hard to read -- which was why his crew was willing to travel so close to it. ""It was a rain-wrapped tornado,"" he said. ""When it is obscured by rain, you can't tell what the danger is.""

One Joplin resident, Donald Davis, described to The Springfield News-Leader driving through the city, saying that Joplin High School's windows were broken out and part of its roof was missing. A church across the street was demolished, he said. He also described damage to a grocery store and a large apartment building.

""They're flattened,"" Mr. Davis said. ""You just can't believe it. There must have been 150 units. One lady had a bathrobe around her. Others just had blankets around them.""

The scene at St. John's hospital was equally overwhelming. ""I spoke to a couple of nurses who were on the sixth floor,"" said Mike Jenkins, a senior producer at Weather Channel who was with Mr. Bettes at the hospital. ""They told me they received a warning, that a tornado or possible tornado was 20 minutes away. They took their precaution, ran through their steps, and five minutes later the windows were blown out, people were blown across the hall.""",2011-05-23,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.992, NEU: 0.006, NEG: 0.002})",0.9923518300056458,0.005695388652384281,0.0019527756376191974,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.923, NEU: 0.074, POS: 0.003})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.883, NEU: 0.114, POS: 0.003})",0.003343797754496336,0.07395763695240021,0.9226985573768616,0.0030005695298314095,0.11367817223072052,0.8833212852478027
32,32,2011-06-23-AfghanistanPullout.txt,"Good evening. Nearly 10 years ago, America suffered the worst attack on our shores since Pearl Harbor. This mass murder was planned by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network in Afghanistan, and signaled a new threat to our security â- one in which the targets were no longer soldiers on a battlefield, but innocent men, women and children going about their daily lives.

In the days that followed, our nation was united as we struck at al Qaeda and routed the Taliban in Afghanistan. Then, our focus shifted. A second war was launched in Iraq, and we spent enormous blood and treasure to support a new government there. By the time I took office, the war in Afghanistan had entered its seventh year. But al Qaedaâs leaders had escaped into Pakistan and were plotting new attacks, while the Taliban had regrouped and gone on the offensive. Without a new strategy and decisive action, our military commanders warned that we could face a resurgent al Qaeda and a Taliban taking over large parts of Afghanistan.

For this reason, in one of the most difficult decisions that Iâve made as President, I ordered an additional 30,000 American troops into Afghanistan. When I announced this surge at West Point, we set clear objectives: to refocus on al Qaeda, to reverse the Talibanâs momentum, and train Afghan security forces to defend their own country. I also made it clear that our commitment would not be open-ended, and that we would begin to draw down our forces this July.

Tonight, I can tell you that we are fulfilling that commitment. Thanks to our extraordinary men and women in uniform, our civilian personnel, and our many coalition partners, we are meeting our goals. As a result, starting next month, we will be able to remove 10,000 of our troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year, and we will bring home a total of 33,000 troops by next summer, fully recovering the surge I announced at West Point. After this initial reduction, our troops will continue coming home at a steady pace as Afghan security forces move into the lead.  Our mission will change from combat to support.  By 2014, this process of transition will be complete, and the Afghan people will be responsible for their own security.

Weâre starting this drawdown from a position of strength. Al Qaeda is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11. Together with the Pakistanis, we have taken out more than half of al Qaedaâs leadership.  And thanks to our intelligence professionals and Special Forces, we killed Osama bin Laden, the only leader that al Qaeda had ever known. This was a victory for all who have served since 9/11. One soldier summed it up well. âThe message,â he said, âis we donât forget. You will be held accountable, no matter how long it takes.â 

The information that we recovered from bin Ladenâs compound shows al Qaeda under enormous strain. Bin Laden expressed concern that al Qaeda had been unable to effectively replace senior terrorists that had been killed, and that al Qaeda has failed in its effort to portray America as a nation at war with Islam -â thereby draining more widespread support. Al Qaeda remains dangerous, and we must be vigilant against attacks. But we have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat, and we will not relent until the job is done.

In Afghanistan, weâve inflicted serious losses on the Taliban and taken a number of its strongholds. Along with our surge, our allies also increased their commitments, which helped stabilize more of the country. Afghan security forces have grown by over 100,000 troops, and in some provinces and municipalities weâve already begun to transition responsibility for security to the Afghan people. In the face of violence and intimidation, Afghans are fighting and dying for their country, establishing local police forces, opening markets and schools, creating new opportunities for women and girls, and trying to turn the page on decades of war.

Of course, huge challenges remain. This is the beginning -- but not the end â- of our effort to wind down this war. Weâll have to do the hard work of keeping the gains that weâve made, while we draw down our forces and transition responsibility for security to the Afghan government. And next May, in Chicago, we will host a summit with our NATO allies and partners to shape the next phase of this transition.

We do know that peace cannot come to a land that has known so much war without a political settlement. So as we strengthen the Afghan government and security forces, America will join initiatives that reconcile the Afghan people, including the Taliban. Our position on these talks is clear: They must be led by the Afghan government, and those who want to be a part of a peaceful Afghanistan must break from al Qaeda, abandon violence, and abide by the Afghan constitution. But, in part because of our military effort, we have reason to believe that progress can be made.

The goal that we seek is achievable, and can be expressed simply: no safe haven from which al Qaeda or its affiliates can launch attacks against our homeland or our allies. We won't try to make Afghanistan a perfect place. We will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely. That is the responsibility of the Afghan government, which must step up its ability to protect its people, and move from an economy shaped by war to one that can sustain a lasting peace. What we can do, and will do, is build a partnership with the Afghan people that endures â- one that ensures that we will be able to continue targeting terrorists and supporting a sovereign Afghan government.

Of course, our efforts must also address terrorist safe havens in Pakistan. No country is more endangered by the presence of violent extremists, which is why we will continue to press Pakistan to expand its participation in securing a more peaceful future for this war-torn region. We'll work with the Pakistani government to root out the cancer of violent extremism, and we will insist that it keeps its commitments. For there should be no doubt that so long as I am President, the United States will never tolerate a safe haven for those who aim to kill us. They cannot elude us, nor escape the justice they deserve. 

My fellow Americans, this has been a difficult decade for our country. We've learned anew the profound cost of war -- a cost that's been paid by the nearly 4,500 Americans who have given their lives in Iraq, and the over 1,500 who have done so in Afghanistan -â men and women who will not live to enjoy the freedom that they defended. Thousands more have been wounded. Some have lost limbs on the battlefield, and others still battle the demons that have followed them home.

Yet tonight, we take comfort in knowing that the tide of war is receding.  Fewer of our sons and daughters are serving in harmâs way. Weâve ended our combat mission in Iraq, with 100,000 American troops already out of that country. And even as there will be dark days ahead in Afghanistan, the light of a secure peace can be seen in the distance. These long wars will come to a responsible end.

As they do, we must learn their lessons. Already this decade of war has caused many to question the nature of Americaâs engagement around the world. Some would have America retreat from our responsibility as an anchor of global security, and embrace an isolation that ignores the very real threats that we face. Others would have America over-extended, confronting every evil that can be found abroad.

We must chart a more centered course. Like generations before, we must embrace Americaâs singular role in the course of human events. But we must be as pragmatic as we are passionate; as strategic as we are resolute. When threatened, we must respond with force â- but when that force can be targeted, we need not deploy large armies overseas. When innocents are being slaughtered and global security endangered, we donât have to choose between standing idly by or acting on our own. Instead, we must rally international action, which weâre doing in Libya, where we do not have a single soldier on the ground, but are supporting allies in protecting the Libyan people and giving them the chance to determine their own destiny.

In all that we do, we must remember that what sets America apart is not solely our power -â it is the principles upon which our union was founded. Weâre a nation that brings our enemies to justice while adhering to the rule of law, and respecting the rights of all our citizens. We protect our own freedom and prosperity by extending it to others.  We stand not for empire, but for self-determination. That is why we have a stake in the democratic aspirations that are now washing across the Arab world. We will support those revolutions with fidelity to our ideals, with the power of our example, and with an unwavering belief that all human beings deserve to live with freedom and dignity.

Above all, we are a nation whose strength abroad has been anchored in opportunity for our citizens here at home. Over the last decade, we have spent a trillion dollars on war, at a time of rising debt and hard economic times. Now, we must invest in Americaâs greatest resource â- our people. We must unleash innovation that creates new jobs and industries, while living within our means. We must rebuild our infrastructure and find new and clean sources of energy. And most of all, after a decade of passionate debate, we must recapture the common purpose that we shared at the beginning of this time of war. For our nation draws strength from our differences, and when our union is strong no hill is too steep, no horizon is beyond our reach.

America, it is time to focus on nation building here at home.

In this effort, we draw inspiration from our fellow Americans who have sacrificed so much on our behalf. To our troops, our veterans and their families, I speak for all Americans when I say that we will keep our sacred trust with you, and provide you with the care and benefits and opportunity that you deserve.

I met some of these patriotic Americans at Fort Campbell. Awhile back, I spoke to the 101st Airborne that has fought to turn the tide in Afghanistan, and to the team that took out Osama bin Laden. Standing in front of a model of bin Ladenâs compound, the Navy SEAL who led that effort paid tribute to those who had been lost - brothers and sisters in arms whose names are now written on bases where our troops stand guard overseas, and on headstones in quiet corners of our country where their memory will never be forgotten. This officer -- like so many others Iâve met on bases, in Baghdad and Bagram, and at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital - spoke with humility about how his unit worked together as one, depending on each other, and trusting one another, as a family might do in a time of peril.

Thatâs a lesson worth remembering -â that we are all a part of one American family. Though we have known disagreement and division, we are bound together by the creed that is written into our founding documents, and a conviction that the United States of America is a country that can achieve whatever it sets out to accomplish. Now, let us finish the work at hand. Let us responsibly end these wars, and reclaim the American Dream that is at the center of our story. With confidence in our cause, with faith in our fellow citizens, and with hope in our hearts, let us go about the work of extending the promise of America for this generation, and the next.

May God bless our troops.

And may God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama ordered the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Afghanistan this year, leaving the bulk of U.S. forces in place into the summer of 2012, when fighting is fiercest, but also signaling the beginning of the end of America's role in the 10-year war.

The announcement pleased neither Democrats in Congress who wanted a faster end to the costly and increasingly unpopular conflict, nor the Republicans and defense officials who had pushed hard to keep more troops in the fight for longer.

Mr. Obama faces reelection in November 2012, and some critics said the timeline he set for pulling out 33,000 surge troops -- leaving about 70,000 troops in the country -- was influenced by politics, a charge the White House strongly denied.

In his 13-minute televised address from the White House Wednesday evening, Mr. Obama said the pullout was justified by military gains against the Taliban insurgency and successful counter-terrorism strikes that have put al Qaeda ""on a path to defeat"" following the killing of Osama bin Laden last month.

""We are starting this drawdown from a position of strength. Al Qaeda is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Of course, huge challenges remain. This is the beginning -- but not the end -- of our effort to wind down this war.""

Mr. Obama gave Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, leeway to determine how quickly to pull out the 10,000 troops this year, allowing him to delay major force reductions until after the current summer fighting season, when the Taliban is most active, a senior military official said.

Mr. Obama said all of the remaining 33,000 surge forces that began arriving in January 2010 would depart Afghanistan ""by next summer."" Officials said that meant the last of those troops would head for home between August and late September.

In an unusually blunt rebuke from a fellow Democrat, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said of Mr. Obama's decision: ""It has been the hope of many in Congress and across the country that the full drawdown of U.S. forces would happen sooner than the president laid out -- and we will continue to press for a better outcome.""

House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said troop levels should be based on conditions on the ground. ""Congress will hold the administration accountable for ensuring that the pace and scope of the drawdown does not undermine the progress we've made thus far,"" he said.

Administration officials said the risk of al Qaeda again using Afghanistan as a base for attacks against the U.S. or its allies was low, removing one of the main justifications for a large troop presence. ""We don't see a transnational threat coming out of Afghanistan,"" one senior administration official said.

But Mr. Obama also signaled the U.S. drone campaign against militants in Pakistan would continue and said he would press Islamabad to step up its own efforts.

""There should be no doubt that so long as I am President, the United States will never tolerate a safe-haven for those who aim to kill us: they cannot elude us, nor escape the justice they deserve,"" he said.

War costs figured centrally in Mr. Obama's decision. The U.S. spends an estimated $1 million a year for each service member in Afghanistan. The conflict has left more than 1,600 Americans dead and cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $500 billion since 2001.

""America, it is time to focus on nation building here at home,"" Mr. Obama said, underlining concerns about the weak U.S. economy.

Mr. Obama's decision to withdraw 10,000 troops this year was based on recommendations he received from Gen. Petraeus and other advisers. According to officials, Gen. Petraeus presented a total of three options to the president, and, along with departing Defense Secretary Robert Gates, urged Mr. Obama to keep the final surge troops in the country until late in the fall of 2012. That would have allowed them to keep fighting until the cold weather brought combat to a natural lull.

Defense officials said the military would find ways to bring sufficient combat power to bear on the Taliban as long as possible under Mr. Obama's withdrawal plan. But some defense officials complained that Mr. Obama's end-of-summer deadline was driven more by the political calendar than the exigencies of war.

To get all surge troops out by the end of next summer, the military will have to start pulling them out in August, officials said. ""We will lose at least two months of the fighting season,"" said a defense official.

Commanders had argued for a slow withdrawal of the surge troops to give the military more time to cement recent security gains in Helmand and Kandahar provinces, in the Taliban heartland of southern Afghanistan.

The drawdown from Afghanistan is similar in some ways to the pullout from Iraq. U.S. troops in Iraq peaked at around 171,000 during the 2007 surge, and have since dropped to under 50,000. The U.S. is scheduled to complete the withdrawal in December but could keep some forces in the country at the request of the Iraqi government. The Iraq war has cost more than $800 billion since its start in 2003.

When Mr. Obama announced the surge of 33,000 troops in December 2009, he promised to begin removing them from Afghanistan in July 2011. He said on Wednesday the drawdown would continue at a ""steady pace"" through the end of 2014, when Afghan forces are slated to assume responsibility for security.

The U.S. is eager to make sure the drawdown announcement wouldn't lead to a rush to the exits by its allies in Afghanistan.

Ahead of Mr. Obama's announcement, the U.K. said that around 200 of an expected 425 personnel Britain plans to remove from the country this year have already left.

British officials are considering a more substantial pullout. The U.K. provides the second-largest troop contingent in Afghanistan, with some 9,500 troops in country.","President Obama declared Wednesday that the United States had largely achieved its goals in Afghanistan, setting in motion a substantial withdrawal of American troops in an acknowledgment of the shifting threat in the region and the fast-changing political and economic landscape in a war-weary America.

Asserting that the country that served as a base for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks no longer represented a terrorist threat to the United States, Mr. Obama declared that the ""tide of war is receding."" And in a blunt recognition of domestic economic strains, he said, ""America, it is time to focus on nation-building here at home.""

Mr. Obama announced plans to withdraw 10,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year. The remaining 20,000 troops from the 2009 ""surge"" of forces would leave by next summer, amounting to about a third of the 100,000 troops now in the country. He said the drawdown would continue ""at a steady pace"" until the United States handed over security to the Afghan authorities in 2014.

The troop reductions, which were decided after a short but fierce internal debate, will be both deeper and faster than the recommendations made by Mr. Obama's military commanders, and they will come as the president faces relentless budget pressures, an increasingly restive American public and a re-election campaign next year.

Mr. Obama, speaking in businesslike tones during a 15-minute address from the East Room of the White House, talked of ending America's longest war and of the painful lessons he thought could be taken from it. While justifying the nation's decade-long commitment, he talked of ""ending the war responsibly"" and warned of the perils of overextending the military by sending large numbers of soldiers into combat. He acknowledged that huge challenges remained before an end to the conflict that has cost hundreds of billions of dollars and 1,500 American lives.

The withdrawals would begin winding down the military's counterinsurgency strategy, which Mr. Obama adopted 18 months ago. Administration officials indicated that they now planned to place more emphasis on focused clandestine counterterrorism operations of the kind that killed Osama bin Laden, which the president cited as Exhibit A in the case for a substantial American troop reduction.

""We are starting this drawdown from a position of strength,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Al Qaeda is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11."" He said that an intense campaign of drone strikes and other covert operations in Pakistan had crippled Al Qaeda's original network in the region, leaving its leaders either dead or pinned down in the rugged border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Of 30 top Qaeda leaders identified by American intelligence, 20 have been killed in the last year and a half, administration officials said.

But the withdrawal of the entire surge force by the end of next summer will significantly change the way that the United States wages war in Afghanistan, analysts said, suggesting that the administration may have concluded it can no longer achieve its loftiest ambitions there.

Mr. Obama acknowledged as much in his remarks. ""We will not try to make Afghanistan a perfect place,"" he said. ""We will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely. That is the responsibility of the Afghan government.""

Mr. Obama's decision is a victory for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has long argued for curtailing the military operation in Afghanistan. Mr. Obama indicated a willingness to move toward more focused covert operations of the type that the United States is conducting in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. ""When threatened, we must respond with force,"" he said. ""But when that force can be targeted, we need not deploy large armies overseas.""

The pace of the withdrawal is a setback for the president's top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, who has been named director of the Central Intelligence Agency. General Petraeus did not endorse the decision, said another official. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates argued publicly against a too-hasty withdrawal of troops, but he said in a statement on Wednesday that he supported Mr. Obama's decision.

During the internal debate, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also expressed reservations about the scale of the reductions, officials said.

General Petraeus had recommended limiting withdrawals to 5,000 troops this year and another 5,000 over the winter.

He and other military commanders argued that the 18 months since Mr. Obama announced the troop increase did not allow for enough time for the Americans to consolidate the fragile gains that they had made in Helmand and other provinces.

But troops have succeeded in clearing many towns and cities of insurgents, and then keeping them safe so that markets were able to reopen and girls could go to school, for example.

Military officials say the withdrawal of American troops will impose limits on which areas of the country can be pacified. In particular, plans to pivot extra American troops from south and southwestern Afghanistan to volatile areas in the east, along the Pakistan border, will be curtailed or even canceled, officials said.

The effort to transfer responsibility for security to Afghan forces remains elusive because the Afghan troops are proving unprepared for the job. Corruption in the government of President Hamid Karzai continues to be rampant, sapping the confidence of many Afghans.

Still, the growing disenchantment in the United States with the war, particularly given the ballooning national debt, the country's slow economic recovery and the whopping $120 billion price tag of the Afghan conflict this year alone, were all considerations weighed by the president. ""Over the last decade, we have spent a trillion dollars on war at a time of rising debt and hard economic times,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Now, we must invest in America's greatest resource: our people.""

Republican presidential candidates including Mitt Romney and Jon M. Huntsman Jr. are demanding a swift withdrawal from Afghanistan, while Democrats complain that the cost of the war is siphoning money away from efforts to create jobs in the United States. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, called on Mr. Obama to speed the withdrawal. ""If we're going to leave, we should leave,"" he said in a statement. ""The centralized system of government foisted upon the Afghan people is not going to hold after we leave. So let's quit prolonging the agony and the inevitable.""

Highlighting the unusual political splits the war is causing, other Republicans criticized the president for pulling out too soon. Representative Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, suggested that Mr. Obama was playing politics with the troop reduction, saying, ""The president is trying to find a political solution with a military component, when it needs to be the other way around."" He said the situation in Afghanistan was ""very precarious,"" and that the White House seemed to be panicking about the levels of violence.

Mr. Obama's speech, delivered at dawn on Thursday, Kabul time, is expected to be the subject of a speech by Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, scheduled for later in the day. Senior figures in Mr. Karzai's administration began signaling that they were comfortable with the withdrawal of 10,000 troops by year's end.

Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, said the Afghan National Army ""has this capability and quantity to fill the gap of those places where the foreign troops withdraw and leave Afghanistan.""

""We are ready,"" General Azimi said.

Muhammad Siddique Aziz, an adviser to Mr. Karzai on tribal affairs, said the withdrawal plan was acceptable, but he warned against a complete withdrawal of American troops before the Afghan government was strong enough to administer the country on its own. ""I think they have to concentrate more on the Afghan government so when they leave, the government can stand up on its own,"" Mr. Aziz said.",2011-06-23,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.967, NEU: 0.030, POS: 0.003})",0.003097898792475462,0.03032466024160385,0.9665773510932922,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.780, NEG: 0.183, POS: 0.036})","AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.602, NEU: 0.391, NEG: 0.007})",0.036112360656261444,0.7804690003395081,0.1834186166524887,0.6019976735115051,0.39125561714172363,0.006746736355125904
33,33,2011-07-26-DebtCeiling.txt,"Good evening.  Tonight, I want to talk about the debate weâve been having in Washington over the national debt -- a debate that directly affects the lives of all Americans.

For the last decade, weâve spent more money than we take in.  In the year 2000, the government had a budget surplus.  But instead of using it to pay off our debt, the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our nationâs credit card.

As a result, the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.  To make matters worse, the recession meant that there was less money coming in, and it required us to spend even more -â on tax cuts for middle-class families to spur the economy; on unemployment insurance; on aid to states so we could prevent more teachers and firefighters and police officers from being laid off.  These emergency steps also added to the deficit.

Now, every family knows that a little credit card debt is manageable.  But if we stay on the current path, our growing debt could cost us jobs and do serious damage to the economy.  More of our tax dollars will go toward paying off the interest on our loans.  Businesses will be less likely to open up shop and hire workers in a country that canât balance its books.  Interest rates could climb for everyone who borrows money -â the homeowner with a mortgage, the student with a college loan, the corner store that wants to expand.  And we wonât have enough money to make job-creating investments in things like education and infrastructure, or pay for vital programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

Because neither party is blameless for the decisions that led to this problem, both parties have a responsibility to solve it.  And over the last several months, thatâs what weâve been trying to do.  I wonât bore you with the details of every plan or proposal, but basically, the debate has centered around two different approaches.

The first approach says, letâs live within our means by making serious, historic cuts in government spending.  Letâs cut domestic spending to the lowest level itâs been since Dwight Eisenhower was President.  Letâs cut defense spending at the Pentagon by hundreds of billions of dollars.  Letâs cut out waste and fraud in health care programs like Medicare -- and at the same time, letâs make modest adjustments so that Medicare is still there for future generations.  Finally, letâs ask the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to give up some of their breaks in the tax code and special deductions.

This balanced approach asks everyone to give a little without requiring anyone to sacrifice too much.  It would reduce the deficit by around $4 trillion and put us on a path to pay down our debt.  And the cuts wouldnât happen so abruptly that theyâd be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from helping small businesses and middle-class families get back on their feet right now.

This approach is also bipartisan.  While many in my own party arenât happy with the painful cuts it makes, enough will be willing to accept them if the burden is fairly shared.  While Republicans might like to see deeper cuts and no revenue at all, there are many in the Senate who have said, âYes, Iâm willing to put politics aside and consider this approach because I care about solving the problem.â  And to his credit, this is the kind of approach the Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, was working on with me over the last several weeks.

The only reason this balanced approach isnât on its way to becoming law right now is because a significant number of Republicans in Congress are insisting on a different approach -- a cuts-only approach -â an approach that doesnât ask the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to contribute anything at all.  And because nothing is asked of those at the top of the income scale, such an approach would close the deficit only with more severe cuts to programs we all care about â- cuts that place a greater burden on working families.

So the debate right now isnât about whether we need to make tough choices.  Democrats and Republicans agree on the amount of deficit reduction we need.  The debate is about how it should be done.  Most Americans, regardless of political party, donât understand how we can ask a senior citizen to pay more for her Medicare before we ask a corporate jet owner or the oil companies to give up tax breaks that other companies donât get.  How can we ask a student to pay more for college before we ask hedge fund managers to stop paying taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries?  How can we slash funding for education and clean energy before we ask people like me to give up tax breaks we donât need and didnât ask for?  

Thatâs not right.  Itâs not fair.  We all want a government that lives within its means, but there are still things we need to pay for as a country -â things like new roads and bridges; weather satellites and food inspection; services to veterans and medical research. 

And keep in mind that under a balanced approach, the 98 percent of Americans who make under $250,000 would see no tax increases at all.  None.  In fact, I want to extend the payroll tax cut for working families.  What weâre talking about under a balanced approach is asking Americans whose incomes have gone up the most over the last decade -â millionaires and billionaires -â to share in the sacrifice everyone else has to make.  And I think these patriotic Americans are willing to pitch in.  In fact, over the last few decades, theyâve pitched in every time we passed a bipartisan deal to reduce the deficit.  The first time a deal was passed, a predecessor of mine made the case for a balanced approach by saying this:

âWould you rather reduce deficits and interest rates by raising revenue from those who are not now paying their fair share, or would you rather accept larger budget deficits, higher interest rates, and higher unemployment?  And I think I know your answer.â

Those words were spoken by Ronald Reagan.  But today, many Republicans in the House refuse to consider this kind of balanced approach -â an approach that was pursued not only by President Reagan, but by the first President Bush, by President Clinton, by myself, and by many Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate.  So weâre left with a stalemate. 

Now, what makes todayâs stalemate so dangerous is that it has been tied to something known as the debt ceiling -â a term that most people outside of Washington have probably never heard of before. 

Understand â- raising the debt ceiling does not allow Congress to spend more money.  It simply gives our country the ability to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up.  In the past, raising the debt ceiling was routine.  Since the 1950s, Congress has always passed it, and every President has signed it.  President Reagan did it 18 times.  George W. Bush did it seven times.  And we have to do it by next Tuesday, August 2nd, or else we wonât be able to pay all of our bills.  

Unfortunately, for the past several weeks, Republican House members have essentially said that the only way theyâll vote to prevent Americaâs first-ever default is if the rest of us agree to their deep, spending cuts-only approach.   

If that happens, and we default, we would not have enough money to pay all of our bills -â bills that include monthly Social Security checks, veteransâ benefits, and the government contracts weâve signed with thousands of businesses. 

For the first time in history, our countryâs AAA credit rating would be downgraded, leaving investors around the world to wonder whether the United States is still a good bet.  Interest rates would skyrocket on credit cards, on mortgages and on car loans, which amounts to a huge tax hike on the American people.  We would risk sparking a deep economic crisis -â this one caused almost entirely by Washington.

So defaulting on our obligations is a reckless and irresponsible outcome to this debate.  And Republican leaders say that they agree we must avoid default.  But the new approach that Speaker Boehner unveiled today, which would temporarily extend the debt ceiling in exchange for spending cuts, would force us to once again face the threat of default just six months from now.  In other words, it doesnât solve the problem.  

First of all, a six-month extension of the debt ceiling might not be enough to avoid a credit downgrade and the higher interest rates that all Americans would have to pay as a result.  We know what we have to do to reduce our deficits; thereâs no point in putting the economy at risk by kicking the can further down the road.    

But thereâs an even greater danger to this approach.  Based on what weâve seen these past few weeks, we know what to expect six months from now.  The House of Representatives will once again refuse to prevent default unless the rest of us accept their cuts-only approach.  Again, they will refuse to ask the wealthiest Americans to give up their tax cuts or deductions.  Again, they will demand harsh cuts to programs like Medicare.  And once again, the economy will be held captive unless they get their way. 

This is no way to run the greatest country on Earth.  Itâs a dangerous game that weâve never played before, and we canât afford to play it now.  Not when the jobs and livelihoods of so many families are at stake.  We canât allow the American people to become collateral damage to Washingtonâs political warfare. 

Congress now has one week left to act, and there are still paths forward.  The Senate has introduced a plan to avoid default, which makes a down payment on deficit reduction and ensures that we donât have to go through this again in six months. 

I think thatâs a much better approach, although serious deficit reduction would still require us to tackle the tough challenges of entitlement and tax reform.  Either way, Iâve told leaders of both parties that they must come up with a fair compromise in the next few days that can pass both houses of Congress -â and a compromise that I can sign.  Iâm confident we can reach this compromise.  Despite our disagreements, Republican leaders and I have found common ground before.  And I believe that enough members of both parties will ultimately put politics aside and help us make progress.

Now, I realize that a lot of the new members of Congress and I donât see eye-to-eye on many issues.  But we were each elected by some of the same Americans for some of the same reasons.  Yes, many want government to start living within its means.  And many are fed up with a system in which the deck seems stacked against middle-class Americans in favor of the wealthiest few.  But do you know what people are fed up with most of all?

Theyâre fed up with a town where compromise has become a dirty word.  They work all day long, many of them scraping by, just to put food on the table.  And when these Americans come home at night, bone-tired, and turn on the news, all they see is the same partisan three-ring circus here in Washington.  They see leaders who canât seem to come together and do what it takes to make life just a little bit better for ordinary Americans.  Theyâre offended by that.  And they should be. 

The American people may have voted for divided government, but they didnât vote for a dysfunctional government.  So Iâm asking you all to make your voice heard.  If you want a balanced approach to reducing the deficit, let your member of Congress know.  If you believe we can solve this problem through compromise, send that message.

America, after all, has always been a grand experiment in compromise.  As a democracy made up of every race and religion, where every belief and point of view is welcomed, we have put to the test time and again the proposition at the heart of our founding:  that out of many, we are one.  Weâve engaged in fierce and passionate debates about the issues of the day, but from slavery to war, from civil liberties to questions of economic justice, we have tried to live by the words that Jefferson once wrote:  âEvery man cannot have his way in all things -- without this mutual disposition, we are disjointed individuals, but not a society.â 

History is scattered with the stories of those who held fast to rigid ideologies and refused to listen to those who disagreed.  But those are not the Americans we remember.  We remember the Americans who put country above self, and set personal grievances aside for the greater good.  We remember the Americans who held this country together during its most difficult hours; who put aside pride and party to form a more perfect union.  

Thatâs who we remember.  Thatâs who we need to be right now.  The entire world is watching.  So letâs seize this moment to show why the United States of America is still the greatest nation on Earth â- not just because we can still keep our word and meet our obligations, but because we can still come together as one nation. 

Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.
","Financial markets on Monday began taking seriously the prospect of a downgrade of the U.S.'s triple-A credit rating, which it has held for nearly a century.

The new worries came as Republicans and Democrats moved even further apart, pushing separate plans for reducing the nation's deficit and raising its borrowing limit.

President Barack Obama warned in a televised prime-time speech that with no clear resolution in sight in Congress, the U.S. government is on the brink of a default that could deeply damage the economy.

""For the first time in history, our country's triple-A credit rating would be downgraded, leaving investors around the world to wonder whether the United States is still a good bet,"" he said.

House Republican Speaker John Boehner responded to the speech by reasserting his plan to avoid default, saying the president's approach was essentially a ""we spend more, you pay more"" philosophy.

Mr. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid earlier on Monday launched competing sales pitches for their separate plans, with the Aug. 2 deadline for a potential U.S. default on its debts little more than a week away.

Rep. Boehner (R., Ohio) briefed Republican lawmakers on his two-phase plan to trim as much as $3 trillion from the U.S. deficit and lift the debt ceiling.

Sen. Reid (D., Nev.) unveiled his separate plan for $2.7 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, a plan that would include a debt-ceiling increase sufficient to carry the government through the end of 2012 and no increase in tax revenue.

Despite the last-minute maneuvering, investors believe officials in Washington will find a way to reach an agreement that allows the government to keep paying its debts. But some worry that any deal might not be enough to stave off a downgrade.

Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings have all warned they might cut the U.S. credit rating. S&P, in particular, has said it could move even if a debt-reduction deal is met and the $14.29 trillion federal debt ceiling is raised.

S&P has cited $4 trillion in debt reduction as a figure that would be appropriate for keeping the triple-A rating. S&P has also said it wants a credible agreement, meaning one that has bipartisan support.

Neither side is close to a $4 trillion figure. And given the wrangling, the chances of strong bipartisan support for any deal seem unlikely, investors said.

President Obama in his speech said that ""a six-month extension of the debt ceiling"" -- similar to the Boehner plan's first phase -- ""might not be enough to avoid a credit downgrade.""

The possibility of a downgrade and its implications became a heavy topic of discussion among Wall Street analysts earlier Monday. ""We have gone past the point of no return regarding the debt downgrade. We fully expect the U.S. will lose its AAA status,"" wrote analysts at Faros Trading.

Spokesmen for S&P, Moody's and Fitch declined to comment.

Until recently, financial markets consistently shrugged off the debt-ceiling fight as distracting political theater. Yields on U.S. Treasurys remain low by historic standards, suggesting a still-robust investor demand for them, but some signs of concern are beginning to bubble. The yield gap between longest-maturity Treasury bonds, which are highly sensitive to fiscal concerns, and the rest of the Treasurys market has widened.

Yields on one-month Treasury bills also have risen. These assets are seen by some to be at risk since they mature in August, when the Treasury could have difficulty meeting obligations if the limit on federal borrowing isn't raised.

Stocks slid Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 88.36 points, or 0.70% to 12592.80. On Tuesday morning, Asian stock markets opened flat or slightly higher and stayed in the black after the Obama and Boehner speeches.

The loss of a triple-A rating, while unlikely to wreak the sort of havoc akin to a default, could lead to a knee-jerk sell-off in stocks, Treasury securities and the dollar.

Gold, already in record territory, could rally further. Banks and insurers, effectively backstopped by the U.S. government, could also face downgrades and find it more costly to borrow money. U.S. agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could also be downgraded. Moody's says about 7,000 municipal ratings could be cut.

The ratings firms, criticized for giving rosy ratings to subprime-mortgage debt before its collapse, have found themselves again in the middle of a potential debt crisis. They have been downgrading debt of European peripheral nations and have spoken out about the need for the U.S. to reduce its deficit.

A top S&P official met with lawmakers in a private meeting on Capitol Hill last week and said the firm could move to downgrade U.S. debt by early next month. While both S&P and Moody's are often in contact with the Treasury and Congress, their threats are drawing high levels of concern from lawmakers and administration officials.

The ratings agencies are playing such a large role in part because so many mutual funds, pension funds and banks, as well as regulators, use the ratings as a benchmark for setting rules and guidelines for investing. Many have long regarded triple-A-rated Treasurys as essentially ""risk free."" Any change to that could have broad ramifications for the way they invest and lend.

Some could prove short-lived, but there might be lingering negative effects in the form of higher borrowing costs for an economy already struggling to pay down debt. A downgrade could further spook already-nervous individual investors or foreign investors the U.S. government depends on to borrow.

Many investors believe that S&P, based on its public statements, is the most likely of the agencies to downgrade the U.S. In recent days, the chairman of S&P's sovereign-ratings committee, John Chambers, has been meeting with some of the world's biggest bond-fund managers.

On Thursday, he visited Pacific Investment Management Co., known as Pimco, for a session dominated by a discussion about a possible downgrade.

The day before, he visited Legg Mason Inc.'s Western Asset Management, which manages $455 billion. A group of 14 large investors, including BlackRock Inc., Legg Mason and pension plans in North Carolina and Florida, formed a coalition, writing an open letter to President Obama and Congress urging a quick resolution to the deficit gridlock.

The notion that the U.S. could be downgraded has strategists and analysts wrestling with what the impact might be. Some say 10-year Treasury yields might rise to 3.5% from 3%, a significant move but still a low rate.

Massive selling of Treasurys is considered unlikely; a downgrade is thought unlikely to force money-market funds or other holders to sell. Banks and insurers, though, likely would be forced to add more capital to support their portfolios, and borrowing costs in general probably would rise, investors said.

CME Group Inc. told traders late Monday that as of Thursday they would need to post more Treasurys when using them as collateral for futures trading, responding to rising volatility in Treasury markets.

President Obama said that without a resolution, ""We would risk sparking a deep economic crisis -- one caused almost entirely by Washington.""","The Democratic-led Senate and Republican-led House on Monday barreled toward a showdown on competing plans to cut spending and raise the debt limit as a resolution to the intensifying crisis remained farther from sight just one week before a possible federal default.

With President Obama trying to employ the power of the presidency to force an agreement, House and Senate leaders said votes could occur as early as Wednesday on competing proposals to slash spending in exchange for increasing federal borrowing authority that the Treasury Department says will be exhausted Aug. 2, raising the prospect that federal bills will go unpaid.

It was a day of legislative chess moves, back-to-back party caucuses and closed-door meetings that ended with a nationally televised presidential address and a rebuttal by the House speaker, John A. Boehner. Their separate speeches reflected that the two sides are farther apart than ever -- just a week ago, the two men were in private negotiations on a ""grand bargain"" of spending cuts and additional revenue, what Mr. Obama called ""a balanced approach.""

""The only reason this balanced approach isn't on its way to becoming law right now is because a significant number of Republicans in Congress are insisting on a different approach, a cuts-only approach -- an approach that doesn't ask the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to contribute anything at all,"" Mr. Obama said in his address. ""And because nothing is asked of those at the top of the income scales, such an approach would close the deficit only with more severe cuts to programs we all care about -- cuts that place a greater burden on working families.""

Even as he sought to set Republicans up for blame for any crisis, Mr. Obama offered assurance that a crisis would be averted. He called on Americans to contact their lawmakers in support of a compromise. ""We would risk sparking a deep economic crisis -- this one caused almost entirely by Washington,"" he said. ""Defaulting on our obligations is a reckless and irresponsible outcome to this debate.""

In response to Mr. Obama, Mr. Boehner said: ""The sad truth is that the president wanted a blank check six months ago, and he wants a blank check today. That is just not going to happen.""

Mr. Boehner urged the president to sign a Republican plan to raise the debt limit. ""If the president signs it,"" he said, ""the 'crisis' atmosphere he has created will simply disappear. The debt limit will be raised.""

Earlier in the day, in dueling news conferences on Capitol Hill, neither side showed any willingness to budge even though time was running very short, creating a distinct air of uncertainty around the Capitol about how the debt limit conflict would end.

""We're about to go over the cliff,"" Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who serves as majority leader, said Monday afternoon as he outlined his plan.

The back and forth began when House Republicans rolled out a two-stage deficit reduction plan that would allow the $14.3 trillion federal debt limit to rise immediately by about $1 trillion in exchange for $1.2 trillion in spending cuts, and tie a second increase early next year to the ability of a new bipartisan Congressional committee to produce more deficit reduction measures.

Mr. Reid dismissed the House Republican plan as a ""nonstarter"" and said Republicans were essentially trying to embarrass Mr. Obama in the middle of the 2012 election year by forcing another debt limit showdown. He said Democrats would not go along with any plan that did not guarantee a debt limit increase through next year.

Democrats countered with a $2.7 trillion menu of spending cuts and an increase in the debt limit through 2012. Neither plan would require any new revenue.

The approach assembled by Mr. Reid quickly received the president's endorsement. Over the next 10 years, it would cut $1.2 trillion from federal agency budgets and wring savings from recurring programs like agriculture subsidies. Like some earlier Republican plans, the plan also counts about $1 trillion in savings from winding down combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, a point objected to by House Republicans who consider such savings as budget trickery since they would occur regardless.

""The plan is full of gimmicks,"" Mr. Boehner told reporters about the Reid proposal, saying it makes no ""real changes in the spending structure of our government, and it doesn't deal with the biggest drivers of our deficit and our debt, and that would be entitlement programs.""

Rushing to beat the Senate to the punch, House Republican leaders were hoping to win approval of their measure on Wednesday and then send it to the Senate. The plan would cut current spending and put legal limits on future spending, saving what Republicans estimate to be about $1.2 trillion over 10 years. That approach would allow a debt limit increase that would extend into early next year.

At the same time, a new 12-member committee evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans would be assigned the job of finding an additional $1.8 trillion in savings. The panel would have special privileges to bring legislation before the House and Senate, and its proposal would not be subjected to amendment or Senate filibuster. If the plan passed, the president could seek a further $1.6 trillion increase in the debt limit based on the new committee's proposal.

In addition, members of the Senate and House would also be required to vote on a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution after Oct. 1 but before the end of the year -- a key demand from many House conservatives.

With House Democrats likely to line up solidly against Mr. Boehner's plan, the Republican leadership was pleading for support among the conservative rank and file, portraying it as the best alternative to end the impasse, even though it might fall short of the deep cuts many of the Republican newcomers want.

Some of the most conservative Republican House members, including Representative Allen West of Florida, endorsed it after the leadership made its case in an afternoon meeting. But others were balking, putting the plan's success at risk should the Republican leadership be forced to rely solely on Republican votes. By day's end, several Republicans -- including Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee -- said Mr. Boehner did not have their vote.

""I can't support it in its current form,"" said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, citing insufficient cuts and ""the dearth of confidence I have in a 12-member commission being able to do what Congress hasn't been able to do.""

At least two Senate conservatives also came out against the House plan, showing that it would face some resistance there from both parties.

Mr. Reid and his fellow Democratic leaders have their own vote problems since they will almost certainly need 60 votes to break a filibuster and advance their proposal. That would require Mr. Reid to hold all the members of his party and win over at least seven Republicans.

In a tactical move, Mr. Reid on Monday night declined to begin the procedural steps needed to force a Senate vote Wednesday, preferring instead to see how Mr. Boehner fared in the House.",2011-07-26,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.891, NEU: 0.102, POS: 0.006})",0.0063112517818808556,0.10222314298152924,0.8914656639099121,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.704, NEU: 0.287, POS: 0.009})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.893, NEG: 0.088, POS: 0.019})",0.008659999817609787,0.28718796372413635,0.7041520476341248,0.018865268677473068,0.8933969736099243,0.08773769438266754
34,34,2011-09-09-SpeechJobsAct.txt,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, and fellow Americans:

Tonight we meet at an urgent time for our country.  We continue to face an economic crisis that has left millions of our neighbors jobless, and a political crisis thatâs made things worse. 

This past week, reporters have been asking, âWhat will this speech mean for the President?  What will it mean for Congress?  How will it affect their polls, and the next election?â

But the millions of Americans who are watching right now, they donât care about politics.  They have real-life concerns.  Many have spent months looking for work.  Others are doing their best just to scrape by -- giving up nights out with the family to save on gas or make the mortgage; postponing retirement to send a kid to college. 

These men and women grew up with faith in an America where hard work and responsibility paid off.  They believed in a country where everyone gets a fair shake and does their fair share -- where if you stepped up, did your job, and were loyal to your company, that loyalty would be rewarded with a decent salary and good benefits; maybe a raise once in a while.  If you did the right thing, you could make it.  Anybody could make it in America. 

For decades now, Americans have watched that compact erode.  They have seen the decks too often stacked against them.  And they know that Washington has not always put their interests first. 

The people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities.  The question tonight is whether weâll meet ours.  The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy.  The question is -- the question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning.    

Those of us here tonight canât solve all our nationâs woes.  Ultimately, our recovery will be driven not by Washington, but by our businesses and our workers.  But we can help.  We can make a difference.  There are steps we can take right now to improve peopleâs lives. 

I am sending this Congress a plan that you should pass right away.  Itâs called the American Jobs Act.  There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation.  Everything in here is the kind of proposal thatâs been supported by both Democrats and Republicans -- including many who sit here tonight.  And everything in this bill will be paid for.  Everything.

The purpose of the American Jobs Act is simple:  to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working.  It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for long-term unemployed. It will provide -- it will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working American and every small business. It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled, and give companies confidence that if they invest and if they hire, there will be customers for their products and services.  You should pass this jobs plan right away.

Everyone here knows that small businesses are where most new jobs begin.  And you know that while corporate profits have come roaring back, smaller companies havenât.  So for everyone who speaks so passionately about making life easier for âjob creators,â this plan is for you.

Pass this jobs bill -- pass this jobs bill, and starting tomorrow, small businesses will get a tax cut if they hire new workers or if they raise workersâ wages.  Pass this jobs bill, and all small business owners will also see their payroll taxes cut in half next year. If you have 50 employees -- if you have 50 employees making an average salary, thatâs an $80,000 tax cut.  And all businesses will be able to continue writing off the investments they make in 2012. 

Itâs not just Democrats who have supported this kind of proposal.  Fifty House Republicans have proposed the same payroll tax cut thatâs in this plan.  You should pass it right away.

Pass this jobs bill, and we can put people to work rebuilding America.  Everyone here knows we have badly decaying roads and bridges all over the country.  Our highways are clogged with traffic.  Our skies are the most congested in the world.  Itâs an outrage.   

Building a world-class transportation system is part of what made us a economic superpower.  And now weâre going to sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads?  At a time when millions of unemployed construction workers could build them right here in America?

There are private construction companies all across America just waiting to get to work.  Thereâs a bridge that needs repair between Ohio and Kentucky thatâs on one of the busiest trucking routes in North America.  A public transit project in Houston that will help clear up one of the worst areas of traffic in the country.  And there are schools throughout this country that desperately need renovating.  How can we expect our kids to do their best in places that are literally falling apart?  This is America.  Every child deserves a great school -- and we can give it to them, if we act now.

The American Jobs Act will repair and modernize at least 35,000 schools.  It will put people to work right now fixing roofs and windows, installing science labs and high-speed Internet in classrooms all across this country.  It will rehabilitate homes and businesses in communities hit hardest by foreclosures.  It will jumpstart thousands of transportation projects all across the country.  And to make sure the money is properly spent, weâre building on reforms weâve already put in place.  No more earmarks.  No more boondoggles.  No more bridges to nowhere.  Weâre cutting the red tape that prevents some of these projects from getting started as quickly as possible.  And weâll set up an independent fund to attract private dollars and issue loans based on two criteria:  how badly a construction project is needed and how much good it will do for the economy.

This idea came from a bill written by a Texas Republican and a Massachusetts Democrat.  The idea for a big boost in construction is supported by Americaâs largest business organization and Americaâs largest labor organization.  Itâs the kind of proposal thatâs been supported in the past by Democrats and Republicans alike.  You should pass it right away.

Pass this jobs bill, and thousands of teachers in every state will go back to work.  These are the men and women charged with preparing our children for a world where the competition has never been tougher.  But while theyâre adding teachers in places like South Korea, weâre laying them off in droves.  Itâs unfair to our kids.  It undermines their future and ours.  And it has to stop.  Pass this bill, and put our teachers back in the classroom where they belong.

Pass this jobs bill, and companies will get extra tax credits if they hire Americaâs veterans.  We ask these men and women to leave their careers, leave their families, risk their lives to fight for our country.  The last thing they should have to do is fight for a job when they come home.

Pass this bill, and hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged young people will have the hope and the dignity of a summer job next year.  And their parents -- their parents, low-income Americans who desperately want to work, will have more ladders out of poverty.

Pass this jobs bill, and companies will get a $4,000 tax credit if they hire anyone who has spent more than six months looking for a job. We have to do more to help the long-term unemployed in their search for work.  This jobs plan builds on a program in Georgia that several Republican leaders have highlighted, where people who collect unemployment insurance participate in temporary work as a way to build their skills while they look for a permanent job.  The plan also extends unemployment insurance for another year. If the millions of unemployed Americans stopped getting this insurance, and stopped using that money for basic necessities, it would be a devastating blow to this economy.  Democrats and Republicans in this chamber have supported unemployment insurance plenty of times in the past.  And in this time of prolonged hardship, you should pass it again -- right away.

Pass this jobs bill, and the typical working family will get a $1,500 tax cut next year.  Fifteen hundred dollars that would have been taken out of your pocket will go into your pocket.  This expands on the tax cut that Democrats and Republicans already passed for this year.  If we allow that tax cut to expire -- if we refuse to act -- middle-class families will get hit with a tax increase at the worst possible time.  We canât let that happen.  I know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live.  Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle-class taxes, which is why you should pass this bill right away.

This is the American Jobs Act.  It will lead to new jobs for construction workers, for teachers, for veterans, for first responders, young people and the long-term unemployed.  It will provide tax credits to companies that hire new workers, tax relief to small business owners, and tax cuts for the middle class.  And hereâs the other thing I want the American people to know: The American Jobs Act will not add to the deficit.  It will be paid for.  And hereâs how.
 
The agreement we passed in July will cut government spending by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years.  It also charges this Congress to come up with an additional $1.5 trillion in savings by Christmas.  Tonight, I am asking you to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the American Jobs Act.  And a week from Monday, Iâll be releasing a more ambitious deficit plan -- a plan that will not only cover the cost of this jobs bill, but stabilize our debt in the long run.

This approach is basically the one Iâve been advocating for months.  In addition to the trillion dollars of spending cuts Iâve already signed into law, itâs a balanced plan that would reduce the deficit by making additional spending cuts, by making modest adjustments to health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and by reforming our tax code in a way that asks the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share. Whatâs more, the spending cuts wouldnât happen so abruptly that theyâd be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from helping small businesses and middle-class families get back on their feet right away.  

Now, I realize there are some in my party who donât think we should make any changes at all to Medicare and Medicaid, and I understand their concerns.  But hereâs the truth:  Millions of Americans rely on Medicare in their retirement.  And millions more will do so in the future.  They pay for this benefit during their working years.  They earn it.  But with an aging population and rising health care costs, we are spending too fast to sustain the program.  And if we donât gradually reform the system while protecting current beneficiaries, it wonât be there when future retirees need it.  We have to reform Medicare to strengthen it.

I am also -- Iâm also well aware that there are many Republicans who donât believe we should raise taxes on those who are most fortunate and can best afford it.  But here is what every American knows:  While most people in this country struggle to make ends meet, a few of the most affluent citizens and most profitable corporations enjoy tax breaks and loopholes that nobody else gets.  Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary -- an outrage he has asked us to fix.  We need a tax code where everyone gets a fair shake and where everybody pays their fair share. And by the way, I believe the vast majority of wealthy Americans and CEOs are willing to do just that if it helps the economy grow and gets our fiscal house in order.   

Iâll also offer ideas to reform a corporate tax code that stands as a monument to special interest influence in Washington.  By eliminating pages of loopholes and deductions, we can lower one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Our tax code should not give an advantage to companies that can afford the best-connected lobbyists.  It should give an advantage to companies that invest and create jobs right here in the United States of America.

So we can reduce this deficit, pay down our debt, and pay for this jobs plan in the process.  But in order to do this, we have to decide what our priorities are.  We have to ask ourselves, âWhatâs the best way to grow the economy and create jobs?â

Should we keep tax loopholes for oil companies?  Or should we use that money to give small business owners a tax credit when they hire new workers?  Because we canât afford to do both.  Should we keep tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires?  Or should we put teachers back to work so our kids can graduate ready for college and good jobs? Right now, we canât afford to do both.  

This isnât political grandstanding.  This isnât class warfare.  This is simple math.  This is simple math.  These are real choices.  These are real choices that weâve got to make.  And Iâm pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose.  Itâs not even close.  And itâs time for us to do whatâs right for our future.

Now, the American Jobs Act answers the urgent need to create jobs right away.  But we canât stop there.  As Iâve argued since I ran for this office, we have to look beyond the immediate crisis and start building an economy that lasts into the future -- an economy that creates good, middle-class jobs that pay well and offer security.  We now live in a world where technology has made it possible for companies to take their business anywhere.  If we want them to start here and stay here and hire here, we have to be able to out-build and out-educate and out-innovate every other country on Earth.

And this task of making America more competitive for the long haul, thatâs a job for all of us.  For government and for private companies.  For states and for local communities -- and for every American citizen.  All of us will have to up our game.  All of us will have to change the way we do business. 

My administration can and will take some steps to improve our competitiveness on our own.  For example, if youâre a small business owner who has a contract with the federal government, weâre going to make sure you get paid a lot faster than you do right now. Weâre also planning to cut away the red tape that prevents too many rapidly growing startup companies from raising capital and going public.  And to help responsible homeowners, weâre going to work with federal housing agencies to help more people refinance their mortgages at interest rates that are now near 4 percent.  Thatâs a step -- I know you guys must be for this, because thatâs a step that can put more than $2,000 a year in a familyâs pocket, and give a lift to an economy still burdened by the drop in housing prices. 

So, some things we can do on our own.  Other steps will require congressional action.  Today you passed reform that will speed up the outdated patent process, so that entrepreneurs can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as possible. Thatâs the kind of action we need.  Now itâs time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in Panama and Colombia and South Korea -â while also helping the workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition. If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, I want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and Chryslers. I want to see more products sold around the world stamped with the three proud words:  âMade in America.â  Thatâs what we need to get done.

And on all of our efforts to strengthen competitiveness, we need to look for ways to work side by side with Americaâs businesses.  Thatâs why Iâve brought together a Jobs Council of leaders from different industries who are developing a wide range of new ideas to help companies grow and create jobs. 

Already, weâve mobilized business leaders to train 10,000 American engineers a year, by providing company internships and training.  Other businesses are covering tuition for workers who learn new skills at community colleges.  And weâre going to make sure the next generation of manufacturing takes root not in China or Europe, but right here, in the United States of America. If we provide the right incentives, the right support -- and if we make sure our trading partners play by the rules -- we can be the ones to build everything from fuel-efficient cars to advanced biofuels to semiconductors that we sell all around the world.  Thatâs how America can be number one again.  And thatâs how America will be number one again.    

Now, I realize that some of you have a different theory on how to grow the economy.  Some of you sincerely believe that the only solution to our economic challenges is to simply cut most government spending and eliminate most government regulations.

Well, I agree that we canât afford wasteful spending, and Iâll work with you, with Congress, to root it out.  And I agree that there are some rules and regulations that do put an unnecessary burden on businesses at a time when they can least afford it.  Thatâs why I ordered a review of all government regulations.  So far, weâve identified over 500 reforms, which will save billions of dollars over the next few years.  We should have no more regulation than the health, safety and security of the American people require.  Every rule should meet that common-sense test. 

But what we canât do -- what I will not do -- is let this economic crisis be used as an excuse to wipe out the basic protections that Americans have counted on for decades. I reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between their jobs and their safety.  I reject the argument that says for the economy to grow, we have to roll back protections that ban hidden fees by credit card companies, or rules that keep our kids from being exposed to mercury, or laws that prevent the health insurance industry from shortchanging patients.  I reject the idea that we have to strip away collective bargaining rights to compete in a global economy. We shouldnât be in a race to the bottom, where we try to offer the cheapest labor and the worst pollution standards.  America should be in a race to the top.  And I believe we can win that race.

In fact, this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle government, refund everybodyâs money, and let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone theyâre on their own -- thatâs not who we are.  Thatâs not the story of America.   

Yes, we are rugged individualists.  Yes, we are strong and self-reliant.  And it has been the drive and initiative of our workers and entrepreneurs that has made this economy the engine and the envy of the world.

But thereâs always been another thread running throughout our history -- a belief that weâre all connected, and that there are some things we can only do together, as a nation.

We all remember Abraham Lincoln as the leader who saved our Union.  Founder of the Republican Party.  But in the middle of a civil war, he was also a leader who looked to the future -- a Republican President who mobilized government to build the Transcontinental Railroad -- launch the National Academy of Sciences, set up the first land grant colleges. And leaders of both parties have followed the example he set. 

Ask yourselves -- where would we be right now if the people who sat here before us decided not to build our highways, not to build our bridges, our dams, our airports?  What would this country be like if we had chosen not to spend money on public high schools, or research universities, or community colleges?  Millions of returning heroes, including my grandfather, had the opportunity to go to school because of the G.I. Bill.  Where would we be if they hadnât had that chance?  

How many jobs would it have cost us if past Congresses decided not to support the basic research that led to the Internet and the computer chip?  What kind of country would this be if this chamber had voted down Social Security or Medicare just because it violated some rigid idea about what government could or could not do?  How many Americans would have suffered as a result? 

No single individual built America on their own.  We built it together.  We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another.  And members of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.

Every proposal Iâve laid out tonight is the kind thatâs been supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past. Every proposal Iâve laid out tonight will be paid for.  And every proposal is designed to meet the urgent needs of our people and our communities. 

Now, I know thereâs been a lot of skepticism about whether the politics of the moment will allow us to pass this jobs plan -- or any jobs plan.  Already, weâre seeing the same old press releases and tweets flying back and forth.  Already, the media has proclaimed that itâs impossible to bridge our differences.  And maybe some of you have decided that those differences are so great that we can only resolve them at the ballot box.  

But know this:  The next election is 14 months away.  And the people who sent us here -- the people who hired us to work for them -- they donât have the luxury of waiting 14 months. Some of them are living week to week, paycheck to paycheck, even day to day.  They need help, and they need it now. 

I donât pretend that this plan will solve all our problems. It should not be, nor will it be, the last plan of action we propose.  Whatâs guided us from the start of this crisis hasnât been the search for a silver bullet.  Itâs been a commitment to stay at it -- to be persistent -- to keep trying every new idea that works, and listen to every good proposal, no matter which party comes up with it. 

Regardless of the arguments weâve had in the past, regardless of the arguments we will have in the future, this plan is the right thing to do right now. You should pass it.  And I intend to take that message to every corner of this country. And I ask -- I ask every American who agrees to lift your voice:  Tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want action now.  Tell Washington that doing nothing is not an option.  Remind us that if we act as one nation and one people, we have it within our power to meet this challenge.

President Kennedy once said, âOur problems are man-made -- therefore they can be solved by man.  And man can be as big as he wants.â

These are difficult years for our country.  But we are Americans.  We are tougher than the times we live in, and we are bigger than our politics have been.  So letâs meet the moment.  Letâs get to work, and letâs show the world once again why the United States of America remains the greatest nation on Earth.

Thank you very much.  God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama called on Congress Thursday to pass a $447 billion package of spending initiatives and tax cuts to boost economic growth, in what might be the White House's last chance to revive its political fortunes before the 2012 campaign kicks into high gear.

More than half of Mr. Obama's plan consists of payroll-tax cuts for employees and employers -- an idea the White House hopes will appeal enough to Republican lawmakers -- and is the policy that could have the best chance to pass.

Among other measures, the president also called for more than $62 billion in spending to extend unemployment insurance benefits through 2012 and fund programs to alleviate long-term joblessness. He also proposed $140 billion in infrastructure spending and aid to states.

The president's plan, unveiled in a speech to a joint session of Congress, is an attempt to wrest the initiative in Washington's protracted debate about fiscal policy. Both parties emerged from the debt-ceiling fight this summer with their approval ratings heading south as the economy stalled with the unemployment rate stuck above 9%.

In one sense, the jobs plan is in part a political strategy designed to give Mr. Obama room to campaign against Congress if lawmakers don't act. White House officials say they don't expect Congress to pass much of the proposal, which they say was constructed from policies that have previously won bipartisan support -- a point Republicans dispute.

Throughout his speech, Mr. Obama made repeated references to Republican plans and ideas, and even used a phrase similar to that employed by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia when he talked about American's getting their ""fair shake.""

At the same time, in a tone that was alternatively demanding and exasperated, he offered a robust defense of the Democratic vision of government and sharply criticized Republicans for their position on taxes and limited government. ""Ultimately, our recovery will be driven not by Washington, but by our businesses and our workers,"" Mr. Obama said. ""But we can help.""

As such, the speech was the latest in a series of efforts by the White House to present the president as above the Washington fray, a strategy designed to appeal to independents the president needs to win reelection but who have been deserting his cause of late.

Such an approach -- setting himself up as the grown-up in town -- didn't work for Mr. Obama during the debt-ceiling debate over the summer. While Congress' approval rating took a greater beating, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, Mr. Obama also took a hit. The Journal/NBC poll showed a sharp drop in voters' confidence that Mr. Obama can achieve his goals.

""Regardless of the arguments we've had in the past, regardless of the arguments we'll have in the future, this plan is the right thing to do right now,"" Mr. Obama said Thursday, his message clearly directed at Republicans. He also repeatedly urged Congress to act with speed on his proposal.

Mr. Obama studiously avoided calling his American Jobs Act a ""stimulus"" plan, a term freighted with political baggage. But it calls for tens of billions of dollars in aid to state and local governments, including cash for hiring teachers and refurbishing schools, as well as a $10 billion infrastructure bank and $50 billion for transportation projects.

Republicans in Congress appear ready to soften, albeit hesitantly, their lockstep opposition to the president. The party is also eager to focus its attention on policies designed to foster job creation, and they offered support for some of the ideas -- a marked change. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said Mr. Obama's proposals ""merit consideration,"" adding that he hoped ""we can work together to end the uncertainty facing families and small businesses.""

Republicans applauded Mr. Obama's proposal to let workers keep receiving unemployment checks while they audition for a job. And some like the idea of an infrastructure bank, funded with federal dollars, though others were suspicious of how the funds would be spent. Mr. Obama's suggestions for increased spending on roads, rail lines, airports and waterways, as well as aid to states, drew GOP opposition.

Mr. Obama largely bucked pressure from members of his own party who have urged him to put forward a bold, left-leaning vision of how to stimulate the economy. Lawmakers may try to enact some elements in Mr. Obama's speech that have bipartisan support to show Washington can tackle hard problems. ""I think it would surprise us all how quickly optimism could return if the relation between the parties could improve,"" said Mr. Cantor, who called the payroll-tax break ""certainly part of the mix.""

The address came on the heels of a government report that showed the economy added zero jobs in August. The options available to policy makers, including at the Federal Reserve, are constrained both by the tepid public interest in spending more money on stimulus projects and the limits of monetary policy with short-term interest rates close to zero.

The president made cutting the deficit a footnote in his speech Thursday night. But, aware of voter interest in curtailing spending, he stressed that his plan will be paid for by closing tax loopholes and other deficit-reduction measures.

Mr. Obama will call on a congressional supercommittee crafting a deficit-reduction package to aim for a larger number that also pays for his $447 billion plan over the next decade. He said he will put forward a plan for the committee on Sept. 19.

Economists have noted the relative small size of the plan and the debatable impact of a temporary cut in payroll taxes. The payroll-tax and unemployment-insurance provisions would be equivalent to about 1% of gross domestic product.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, estimated that the plan would add 2 percentage points to real GDP growth and 1.9 million payroll jobs, while reducing the unemployment rate by a percentage point.

White House officials said most of the spending in Mr. Obama's plan would take effect in 2012, although some funding, such as $35 billion for teacher hiring, could be spread over the next two years, White House officials said.

On the tax front, Mr. Obama's plan would cut the payroll tax for employers in half for businesses' first $5 million of wages. Additionally, businesses would get a full payroll tax holiday for any increase in payroll up to $50 million.

Mr. Obama's plan includes an initiative, modeled after programs in states like Georgia and North Carolina, which would allow people who have been unemployed for six months or more to work for up to eight weeks while receiving unemployment benefits, a way to forestall the problems that come with long-term unemployment.","Mixing politically moderate proposals with a punchy tone, President Obama challenged lawmakers on Thursday to ""pass this jobs bill"" -- a blunt call on Congress to enact his $447 billion package of tax cuts and new government spending, designed to revive a stalling economy and his own political standing.

Speaking to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama ticked off a list of measures that he emphasized had been supported by both Republicans and Democrats in the past. To keep the proposals from adding to the swelling federal deficit, Mr. Obama also said he would encourage a more ambitious target for long-term reduction of the deficit.

""You should pass this jobs plan right away,"" the president declared over and over in his 32-minute speech, in which he eschewed his trademark soaring oratory in favor of a plainspoken appeal for action, stiffened by a few sarcastic political jabs.

With Republicans listening politely but with stone-faced expressions, Mr. Obama said, ""The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy.""

Though Mr. Obama's proposals -- including an expansion of a cut in payroll taxes and new spending on public works -- were widely expected, the package was substantially larger than predicted, and much of the money would flow into the economic bloodstream in 2012. The pace would be similar to that of the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009, which was spread over more than two years. Analysts said that, if passed, the package would likely lift growth somewhat.

While Republicans did not often applaud Mr. Obama,, party leaders greeted his proposals with uncharacteristic conciliation. Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and other Republicans signaled a willingness to consider at least some of the measures, reflecting what some have described as anger in their home districts over the political dysfunction in Washington.

""The proposals the president outlined tonight merit consideration,"" Speaker John A. Boehner said in a statement. ""We hope he gives serious consideration to our ideas as well.""

Still, analysts said it was unlikely that the White House would win Congressional approval for many elements of the package.

For Mr. Obama, burdened by the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, the address crystallized the multiple challenges he faces, among them reviving a torpid economy with a Republican House that, however receptive some of its leaders appeared Thursday, has staked out a relentlessly confrontational course with the White House. The president must also shake off a perception, after so many speeches on the economy, that he has not delivered on the promise of his oratory.

After weeks on the defensive, however, Mr. Obama seemed to get off his back foot. He framed the debate over the economy as a tug-of-war between mainstream American values and a radical, antigovernment orthodoxy that holds that ""the only thing we can do restore prosperity is just dismantle government, refund everyone's money, let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone they're on their own.""

With a difficult re-election bid looming, Mr. Obama declared that his vision would appeal to more voters. ""These are real choices we have to make,"" he said. ""And I'm pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose. It's not even close.""

At times, he edged into sarcasm. Promoting the extension in the payroll tax cut to Republicans, Mr. Obama said: ""I know some of you have sworn oaths never to raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle-class taxes, which is why you should pass this bill right away.""

The centerpiece of the bill, known as the American Jobs Act, is an extension and expansion of the cut in payroll taxes, worth $240 billion, under which the tax paid by employees would be cut in half through 2012. Smaller businesses would also get a cut in their payroll taxes, as well as a tax holiday for hiring new employees. The plan also provides $140 billion for modernizing schools and repairing roads and bridges -- spending that Mr. Obama portrayed as critical to maintaining America's competitiveness.

The president insisted that everything in the package would be paid for by raising the target for long-term spending cuts to be negotiated by a special Congressional committee. He did not go through the arithmetic, but said he would send a detailed proposal to Congress in a week. Senior White House officials said the amount of increased spending cuts would hinge on how much of the plan gets through Congress.

Mr. Obama said most of his proposals had support from both parties, a contention that Republican leaders rejected. ""There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation,"" he said. ""Everything in here is the kind of proposal that's been supported by Democrats and Republicans.""

After a summer consumed by bitter debate over how to reduce the debt and deficit, Mr. Obama kept his focus squarely on the need to create jobs. He acknowledged that the government's role in fixing the problem was limited, but rejected the Republican argument that Washington's major contribution would be to eliminate regulations.

""Ultimately, our recovery will be driven not by Washington, but by our businesses and our workers,"" he said. ""But we can help. We can make a difference. There are steps we can take right now to improve people's lives.""

Still, even if every one of the proposals were passed by Congress -- something that is extremely unlikely to happen -- the measures would not solve the economy's problems, forecasters say, though they would likely spur some growth.

And that encapsulates the quandary for Mr. Obama: so long as there is no evidence of improvement in the job market, his economic call to arms -- backed by a familiar list of proposed remedies -- may not resonate with an American public grown weary of stagnation and an unemployment rate stuck at 9.1 percent.

Even the scheduling of the speech set off a tempest when Mr. Boehner rejected Mr. Obama's request to address Congress on Wednesday, the night of a Republican presidential debate. At Mr. Boehner's request, the White House agreed to move the date to Thursday, which meant Mr. Obama had to wrap up his remarks before the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers kicked off the N.F.L. season. As Mr. Obama was entering the chamber, microphones caught him assuring a lawmaker that his speech would not interfere with the game.

In setting out his program, Mr. Obama was, in effect, daring Republicans not to pass measures that enjoy support among independent voters and business leaders. If the Republicans refuse to embrace at least some of the measures, administration officials said, Mr. Obama will take them directly to the American public, portraying Congress as do-nothing and obstructionist.

""Maybe some of you have decided that those differences are so great that we can only resolve them at the ballot box,"" Mr. Obama told the lawmakers. ""But know this: the next election is fourteen months away. And the people who sent us here -- the people who hired us to work for them -- they don't have the luxury of waiting fourteen months.""",2011-09-09,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.918, NEU: 0.078, POS: 0.003})",0.0032627610489726067,0.07842452079057693,0.918312668800354,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.529, NEU: 0.468, NEG: 0.003})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.625, POS: 0.370, NEG: 0.006})",0.5288287401199341,0.46787846088409424,0.003292880952358246,0.3698062598705292,0.6246183514595032,0.005575431976467371
35,35,2011-10-17-MLKDedication.txt,"An earthquake and a hurricane may have delayed this day, but this is a day that would not be denied.

For this day, we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.âs return to the National Mall.  In this place, he will stand for all time, among monuments to those who fathered this nation and those who defended it; a black preacher with no official rank or title who somehow gave voice to our deepest dreams and our most lasting ideals, a man who stirred our conscience and thereby helped make our union more perfect.

And Dr. King would be the first to remind us that this memorial is not for him alone.  The movement of which he was a part depended on an entire generation of leaders.  Many are here today, and for their service and their sacrifice, we owe them our everlasting gratitude.  This is a monument to your collective achievement.

Some giants of the civil rights movement -- like Rosa Parks and Dorothy Height, Benjamin Hooks, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth -- theyâve been taken from us these past few years.  This monument attests to their strength and their courage, and while we miss them dearly, we know they rest in a better place. 

And finally, there are the multitudes of men and women whose names never appear in the history books -- those who marched and those who sang, those who sat in and those who stood firm, those who organized and those who mobilized -- all those men and women who through countless acts of quiet heroism helped bring about changes few thought were even possible. âBy the thousands,â said Dr. King, âfaceless, anonymous, relentless young people, black and whiteâ¦have taken our whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in the formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.â  To those men and women, to those foot soldiers for justice, know that this monument is yours, as well.

Nearly half a century has passed since that historic March on Washington, a day when thousands upon thousands gathered for jobs and for freedom.  That is what our schoolchildren remember best when they think of Dr. King -- his booming voice across this Mall, calling on America to make freedom a reality for all of Godâs children, [prophesying] of a day when the jangling discord of our nation would be transformed into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.

It is right that we honor that march, that we lift up Dr. Kingâs âI Have a Dreamâ speech -- for without that shining moment, without Dr. Kingâs glorious words, we might not have had the courage to come as far as we have.  Because of that hopeful vision, because of Dr. Kingâs moral imagination, barricades began to fall and bigotry began to fade.  New doors of opportunity swung open for an entire generation.  Yes, laws changed, but hearts and minds changed, as well. 

Look at the faces here around you, and you see an America that is more fair and more free and more just than the one Dr. King addressed that day.  We are right to savor that slow but certain progress -- progress thatâs expressed itself in a million ways, large and small, across this nation every single day, as people of all colors and creeds live together, and work together, and fight alongside one another, and learn together, and build together, and love one another.

So it is right for us to celebrate today Dr. Kingâs dream and his vision of unity.  And yet it is also important on this day to remind ourselves that such progress did not come easily; that Dr. Kingâs faith was hard-won; that it sprung out of a harsh reality and some bitter disappointments. 

It is right for us to celebrate Dr. Kingâs marvelous oratory, but it is worth remembering that progress did not come from words alone.  Progress was hard.  Progress was purchased through enduring the smack of billy clubs and the blast of fire hoses.  It was bought with days in jail cells and nights of bomb threats.  For every victory during the height of the civil rights movement, there were setbacks and there were defeats. 

We forget now, but during his life, Dr. King wasnât always considered a unifying figure.  Even after rising to prominence, even after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. King was vilified by many, denounced as a rabble rouser and an agitator, a communist and a radical.  He was even attacked by his own people, by those who felt he was going too fast or those who felt he was going too slow; by those who felt he shouldnât meddle in issues like the Vietnam War or the rights of union workers.  We know from his own testimony the doubts and the pain this caused him, and that the controversy that would swirl around his actions would last until the fateful day he died.

I raise all this because nearly 50 years after the March on Washington, our work, Dr. Kingâs work, is not yet complete.  We gather here at a moment of great challenge and great change.  In the first decade of this new century, we have been tested by war and by tragedy; by an economic crisis and its aftermath that has left millions out of work, and poverty on the rise, and millions more just struggling to get by.  Indeed, even before this crisis struck, we had endured a decade of rising inequality and stagnant wages.  In too many troubled neighborhoods across the country, the conditions of our poorest citizens appear little changed from what existed 50 years ago -- neighborhoods with underfunded schools and broken-down slums, inadequate health care, constant violence, neighborhoods in which too many young people grow up with little hope and few prospects for the future.

Our work is not done.  And so on this day, in which we celebrate a man and a movement that did so much for this country, let us draw strength from those earlier struggles.  First and foremost, let us remember that change has never been quick.  Change has never been simple, or without controversy.  Change depends on persistence.  Change requires determination.  It took a full decade before the moral guidance of Brown v. Board of Education was translated into the enforcement measures of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, but those 10 long years did not lead Dr. King to give up.  He kept on pushing, he kept on speaking, he kept on marching until change finally came.

And then when, even after the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act passed, African Americans still found themselves trapped in pockets of poverty across the country, Dr. King didnât say those laws were a failure; he didnât say this is too hard; he didnât say, letâs settle for what we got and go home.  Instead he said, letâs take those victories and broaden our mission to achieve not just civil and political equality but also economic justice; letâs fight for a living wage and better schools and jobs for all who are willing to work.  In other words, when met with hardship, when confronting disappointment, Dr. King refused to accept what he called the âisnessâ of today.  He kept pushing towards the âoughtnessâ of tomorrow.

And so, as we think about all the work that we must do -- rebuilding an economy that can compete on a global stage, and fixing our schools so that every child -- not just some, but every child -- gets a world-class education, and making sure that our health care system is affordable and accessible to all, and that our economic system is one in which everybody gets a fair shake and everybody does their fair share, let us not be trapped by what is.  We canât be discouraged by what is.  Weâve got to keep pushing for what ought to be, the America we ought to leave to our children, mindful that the hardships we face are nothing compared to those Dr. King and his fellow marchers faced 50 years ago, and that if we maintain our faith, in ourselves and in the possibilities of this nation, there is no challenge we cannot surmount.

And just as we draw strength from Dr. Kingâs struggles, so must we draw inspiration from his constant insistence on the oneness of man; the belief in his words that âwe are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.â  It was that insistence, rooted in his Christian faith, that led him to tell a group of angry young protesters, âI love you as I love my own children,â even as one threw a rock that glanced off his neck. 

It was that insistence, that belief that God resides in each of us, from the high to the low, in the oppressor and the oppressed, that convinced him that people and systems could change.  It fortified his belief in non-violence.  It permitted him to place his faith in a government that had fallen short of its ideals.  It led him to see his charge not only as freeing black America from the shackles of discrimination, but also freeing many Americans from their own prejudices, and freeing Americans of every color from the depredations of poverty.
    
And so at this moment, when our politics appear so sharply polarized, and faith in our institutions so greatly diminished, we need more than ever to take heed of Dr. Kingâs teachings.  He calls on us to stand in the other personâs shoes; to see through their eyes; to understand their pain.  He tells us that we have a duty to fight against poverty, even if we are well off; to care about the child in the decrepit school even if our own children are doing fine; to show compassion toward the immigrant family, with the knowledge that most of us are only a few generations removed from similar hardships.

To say that we are bound together as one people, and must constantly strive to see ourselves in one another, is not to argue for a false unity that papers over our differences and ratifies an unjust status quo.  As was true 50 years ago, as has been true throughout human history, those with power and privilege will often decry any call for change as âdivisive.â  Theyâll say any challenge to the existing arrangements are unwise and destabilizing.  Dr. King understood that peace without justice was no peace at all; that aligning our reality with our ideals often requires the speaking of uncomfortable truths and the creative tension of non-violent protest.

But he also understood that to bring about true and lasting change, there must be the possibility of reconciliation; that any social movement has to channel this tension through the spirit of love and mutuality.

If he were alive today, I believe he would remind us that the unemployed worker can rightly challenge the excesses of Wall Street without demonizing all who work there; that the businessman can enter tough negotiations with his companyâs union without vilifying the right to collectively bargain.  He would want us to know we can argue fiercely about the proper size and role of government without questioning each otherâs love for this country -- with the knowledge that in this democracy, government is no distant object but is rather an expression of our common commitments to one another.  He would call on us to assume the best in each other rather than the worst, and challenge one another in ways that ultimately heal rather than wound.

In the end, thatâs what I hope my daughters take away from this monument.  I want them to come away from here with a faith in what they can accomplish when they are determined and working for a righteous cause.  I want them to come away from here with a faith in other people and a faith in a benevolent God.  This sculpture, massive and iconic as it is, will remind them of Dr. Kingâs strength, but to see him only as larger than life would do a disservice to what he taught us about ourselves.  He would want them to know that he had setbacks, because they will have setbacks.  He would want them to know that he had doubts, because they will have doubts.  He would want them to know that he was flawed, because all of us have flaws.

It is precisely because Dr. King was a man of flesh and blood and not a figure of stone that he inspires us so.  His life, his story, tells us that change can come if you donât give up.  He would not give up, no matter how long it took, because in the smallest hamlets and the darkest slums, he had witnessed the highest reaches of the human spirit; because in those moments when the struggle seemed most hopeless, he had seen men and women and children conquer their fear; because he had seen hills and mountains made low and rough places made plain, and the crooked places made straight and God make a way out of no way.

And that is why we honor this man -- because he had faith in us.  And that is why he belongs on this Mall -- because he saw what we might become.  That is why Dr. King was so quintessentially American -- because for all the hardships weâve endured, for all our sometimes tragic history, ours is a story of optimism and achievement and constant striving that is unique upon this Earth.  And that is why the rest of the world still looks to us to lead.  This is a country where ordinary people find in their hearts the courage to do extraordinary things; the courage to stand up in the face of the fiercest resistance and despair and say this is wrong, and this is right; we will not settle for what the cynics tell us we have to accept and we will reach again and again, no matter the odds, for what we know is possible.

That is the conviction we must carry now in our hearts.  As tough as times may be, I know we will overcome.  I know there are better days ahead.  I know this because of the man towering over us.  I know this because all he and his generation endured -- we are here today in a country that dedicated a monument to that legacy. 

And so with our eyes on the horizon and our faith squarely placed in one another, let us keep striving; let us keep struggling; let us keep climbing toward that promised land of a nation and a world that is more fair, and more just, and more equal for every single child of God.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
","The new $120 million Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, dedicated by President Barack Obama on Sunday, is situated at the northwestern corner of the Tidal Basin in this capital's monumental core. Its success or failure depends on its centerpiece, a colossal portrait of the slain civil-rights leader, rendered in three-quarter relief. The work of Lei Yixin, a member in good standing of China's official monuments industry, the portrait was conceived for monumental effect. Sad to say, it's merely big.

The sculptural portrait is set within a four-acre King Memorial precinct that runs in a long arc alongside the basin, with the arc bisected by an entry axis roughly aligned with the intersection of Independence Avenue and West Basin Drive. The precinct slopes gently down toward the water. Its long, massive perimeter berms, which tilt upward from the avenue and the drive, respectively, jut into the two sundered portions of a beige-tinted granite mass, the Mountain of Despair, which are themselves aligned with the entry axis. The Stone of Hope, which bears the portrait of King and exceeds 30 feet in height, is designed to appear as if it had been cut out of the Mountain. It stands 50 feet closer to the water's edge.

The symbolism draws on King's 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech at the Lincoln Memorial in which he said, ""With this faith we will be able to hew out of a mountain of despair a stone of hope."" It was a core element of the competition-winning design produced a decade ago by the Roma Design Group of San Francisco, although the memorial as built is a much-modified version of the original concept. The Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation retained Mr. Lei to create the Mountain, Stone and relief portrait.

Also facing the Tidal Basin is a 450-foot-long ""inscription wall"" of gray-green granite that doubles as a retaining wall for the berms. There are narrow waterfalls where it meets the Mountain masses while, like Maya Lin's nearby Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall, the inscription wall decreases in height as distance from the Mountain increases.

The King Memorial is interspersed with several large landscaped pods planted with saplings (mainly the familiar Japanese cherries) along with shrubs, turf and flowers. These pods are girded with granite borders of varying heights that serve as benches. Mountain and Stone will thus be largely screened from Independence Avenue, along which new elms have been planted as well.

The entrance to the memorial's berm-flanked forecourt is from West Basin Drive, and from there you pass between the smooth inner faces of the Mountain masses. The outer faces of the Stone lying ahead are likewise finished, so it reads unmistakably as a mass ""hewn"" out of the Mountain. It has also been moved out of alignment with the gap in the Mountain and turned so the King portrait faces the Jefferson Memorial across the Tidal Basin. This is an intentional reference to King's description of the Declaration of Independence in his 1963 speech as a ""promissory note"" on which ""America has defaulted . . . insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.""

To be sure, the King relief looms large when you stand in front of it. Mr. Lei has rendered the civil-rights leader in a rigid, frontal pose, with his legs slightly parted. He is wearing a suit and tie and has his arms crossed and his head turned slightly to his right. But the King figure presents us with a disquieting collage of clumsy forms. The legs emerging from the Stone are treated as a pair of rectilinear planes forming a vertical crease. The jacket is more fully modeled, but its lower hem is absurdly thick. King's clothed torso consists of broad, crudely simplistic planes that convey little of the underlying anatomic structure. Moreover, he looks rather squat because the breadth of his shoulders is exaggerated while his neck is scarcely visible.

Mr. Lei has failed to capture King's facial features, starting with the eyes. Instead, the face consists of reductively rotund or -- as with the lips, nostrils and slightly cleft chin -- positively bulbous shapes. King wears a pensive, grave expression. It was softened at the insistence of the Commission of Fine Arts, which did not want a confrontational figure. But if you don't achieve a vivid likeness, a vivid characterization is hard to come by. Overall, the portrait doesn't resolve into a resonant whole. Far from defining King as a man -- or as the dominant figure in America's civil-rights movement -- it barely resembles him. And without a successful portrait, you don't have much of a monument.

Complaints have arisen that a quote on the Stone of Hope -- ""I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness"" -- is an inept paraphrase that makes King sound egotistical. Certainly the inscription-wall quotations should have focused exclusively on his crusade against Jim Crow, which is the reason he has a memorial near Thomas Jefferson's, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's and Abraham Lincoln's. Instead, the inscriptions digress into King's opposition to the Vietnam War, along with expressions of internationalist sentiment worthy of any number of forgettable United Nations functionaries. Example: ""Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.""

And despite the intended relationship between the Stone and the Jefferson Memorial, reciprocal views between the King and Jefferson memorials hardly enhance the former's stature. John Russell Pope's great temple -- a structure many times larger than the Mountain and Stone -- reads beautifully from the King Memorial. But from the Jefferson, the Mountain and Stone are a smallish, rather lumpen assemblage, diminished in this vast setting by the multitude of tall trees looming in the background as well as the Lincoln Memorial and office buildings in Rosslyn, Va., across the Potomac. It's as if this important view of the King Memorial wasn't even considered during the design process.

Even when viewed from the King Memorial forecourt, the Mountain masses are unimposing. It's the adjoining berms whose large scale registers. Partly on this account, and partly because of the overly schematic treatment of the memorial's quasigeological elements, the translation of King's mountain/stone figure of speech into three-dimensional form, like the relief portrait, is unconvincing. In short, monumental intentions have gone unfulfilled at the King Memorial.","They came from across the country, some arriving before dawn, carrying folding chairs, cameras and a strong, proud sense of history. Thousands stood and sat together under a bright blue sky Sunday as a memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- the first honoring an African-American in the area of the Mall -- was dedicated at last.

The morning ceremony, which ended with a speech by President Obama, took the audience back through 48 years of history, to 1963 and a defining moment for the civil rights movement, when Dr. King led the March on Washington and gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Mr. Obama is a direct beneficiary of the civil rights movement, a point he has made in past speeches. And at times Sunday, when he spoke of Dr. King's struggles, it was easy for many to think that the president was speaking of himself.

""For every victory, there were setbacks,"" he said. ""Even after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. King was vilified by many.""

Before Mr. Obama spoke, a star-studded list of other speakers -- including Dr. King's children, civil rights leaders like Jesse Jackson and Representative John Lewis, and performers including Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder -- invoked Dr. King's principles of social justice. Calling them all the more relevant today, at a time of economic hardship and growing inequality, the speakers implored the crowd to apply them.

""We should never adjust to 1 percent of the people controlling 40 percent of the wealth,"" said Bernice King, Dr. King's daughter. ""I hear my father say, 'We must have a radical revolution of values and reordering of priorities of this nation.' ""

The audience, which was overwhelmingly black, cheered its approval, the heads a sea of white baseball caps, which had been handed out at the entrance, interrupted by the occasional Sunday hat.

""I'm so happy. Aren't you happy?"" said Pat Harris, 53, clad in a purple sweat suit and a white vest and dancing in the grass to Mr. Wonder's music shortly after the president's speech.

Ms. Harris grew up in poverty and segregation in the Mississippi Delta town of Belzoni, she said. Now she is a federal employee in Washington, where, she said, she lives better than her parents did, progress that she credits to Dr. King.

""We stand here today, economically O.K., because of that man,"" she said.

The memorial -- a four-acre tract along the Tidal Basin that is dotted with elms and cherry trees and anchored by an imposing granite statue of Dr. King -- is the product of more than two decades of work. It was conceived in 1983 by members of Dr. King's fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, and authorized by Congress in 1996.

It was originally scheduled to be dedicated in August to coincide with the 48th anniversary of the March on Washington, but Hurricane Irene intervened.

The monument to Dr. King is the first to a black man on the Mall, ,heightening the emotion for visitors. His stone figure faces the Jefferson Memorial across the water. Lincoln is at his back, and Roosevelt to his right.

""This is just wonderful. It's a thrill,"" said Hattie Jones from Arlington, Va. ""Tears just ran down my eyes automatically when I saw it. It's really inspiring.""

The presence of Mr. Obama seemed to energize the crowd, with a loud ovation and shouts of ""Four more years!"" and ""That's the man!"" as he took the stage. But his speech drew tepid applause from some in the audience who said they felt he was too restrained.

""He has the ability to put it where the goats can get it, but instead he keeps it all in a little box,"" Ms. Harris said, a reference to Mr. Obama's oratory skills. She added: ""We like him. We just wish he would fight harder.""

Some of the loudest cheers were for the Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered a series of memorable one-liners in a speech laced with religious references in the style of Dr. King.

Of the Republican plan to change Medicare, he said: ""This is not about Obama. This is about your mama!""

A number of speakers made direct appeals to people to vote for Mr. Obama. Mr. Jackson, twice a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1980s, referred to Mr. Obama's Republican opponents as ""men that seem willing to sink the ship just to destroy the captain.""

Most speakers cast today's struggle as being as much about economics as race, and mentioned Dr. King's effort to organize the nation's poor shortly before his death in 1968. Several pointed to the Occupy Wall Street protests as evidence of modern-day protest and discontent.

""They changed the game on us,"" said Andrew Young, a friend of Dr. King's and a former mayor of Atlanta. ""Now it's economics that controls the politics.""

He added: ""Just like we won the battle of voting rights, we can win the battle of economic rights.""

Carolyn Bledsoe, 70, a retired teacher who lives in Washington and who participated in the 1963 march, praised the progress since her childhood in the Jim Crow South, where her father was a sharecropper. But racism, she said, has simply changed form -- more insidious, less direct.

""Now it's on paper,"" she said.

Ms. Bledsoe recalled the shame of being turned away from the first McDonald's in Goldsboro, N.C., in the 1950s because she was black, a feeling that most of her young students have not experienced. Race still binds them, she said, just in subtler ways.

The March on Washington she recalled fondly and a little wistfully. Most young people do not understand how her generation struggled, Ms. Bledsoe said. The country has come a long way, but not far enough.

""Some days I feel like we're at the beginning,"" she said. ""Some days I feel like we're in the middle. But I never feel like we're at the end.""

Lonnie Bunch, founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, said he believed the monument would help.

""For so long, we either tried to ignore race, tamp it down or try to say that it's over, that we've solved all the problems,"" Mr. Bunch said. ""His struggle helped us realize there's still a great deal of ambiguity about race. His monument will ensure we don't forget it.""",2011-10-17,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.982, NEU: 0.017, NEG: 0.001})",0.9817721843719482,0.016786806285381317,0.0014410719741135836,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.890, POS: 0.058, NEG: 0.052})","AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.891, NEU: 0.108, NEG: 0.001})",0.058179792016744614,0.8901855945587158,0.051634546369314194,0.8905619382858276,0.10825230181217194,0.0011857642093673348
36,36,2011-11-17-AustraliaSpeech.txt,"Prime Minister Gillard, Leader Abbott, thank you both for your very warm welcome.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, members of the House and Senate, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for the honor of standing in this great chamber to reaffirm the bonds between the United States and the Commonwealth of Australia, two of the worldâs oldest democracies and two of the world's oldest friends.

To you and the people of Australia, thank you for your extraordinary hospitality.  And here, in this city -- this ancient âmeeting placeâ -- I want to acknowledge the original inhabitants of this land, and one of the worldâs oldest continuous cultures, the First Australians.

I first came to Australia as a child, traveling between my birthplace of Hawaii, and Indonesia, where I would live for four years.  As an eight-year-old, I couldnât always understand your foreign language. Last night I did try to talk some ""Strine.""  Today I donât want to subject you to any earbashing.  I really do love that one and I will be introducing that into the vernacular in Washington.

But to a young American boy, Australia and its people -- your optimism, your easy-going ways, your irreverent sense of humor -- all felt so familiar.  It felt like home.  Iâve always wanted to return.  I tried last year -- twice.  But this is a Lucky Country, and today I feel lucky to be here as we mark the 60th anniversary of our unbreakable alliance.

The bonds between us run deep.  In each otherâs story we see so much of ourselves.  Ancestors who crossed vast oceans -- some by choice, some in chains.  Settlers who pushed west across sweeping plains.  Dreamers who toiled with hearts and hands to lay railroads and to build cities.  Generations of immigrants who, with each new arrival, add a new thread to the brilliant tapestry of our nations.  And we are citizens who live by a common creed -- no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, everyone deserves a fair chance; everyone deserves a fair go.

Of course, progress in our society has not always come without tensions, or struggles to overcome a painful past.  But we are countries with a willingness to face our imperfections, and to keep reaching for our ideals.  Thatâs the spirit we saw in this chamber three years ago, as this nation inspired the world with a historic gesture of reconciliation with Indigenous Australians.  Itâs the spirit of progress, in America, which allows me to stand before you today, as President of the United States.  And itâs the spirit Iâll see later today when I become the first U.S. President to visit the Northern Territory, where Iâll meet the Traditional Owners of the Land.

Nor has our progress come without great sacrifice.  This morning, I was humbled and deeply moved by a visit to your war memorial to pay my respects to Australiaâs fallen sons and daughters.  Later today, in Darwin, Iâll join the Prime Minister in saluting our brave men and women in uniform.  And it will be a reminder that -- from the trenches of the First World War to the mountains of Afghanistan -- Aussies and Americans have stood together, we have fought together, we have given lives together in every single major conflict of the past hundred years.  Every single one.

This solidarity has sustained us through a difficult decade. We will never forget the attacks of 9/11, that took the lives not only of Americans, but people from many nations, including Australia.  In the United States, we will never forget how Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty -- for the first time ever -- showing that our two nations stood as one.  And none of us will ever forget those weâve lost to al Qaedaâs terror in the years since, including innocent Australians.

And thatâs why, as both the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader indicated, we are determined to succeed in Afghanistan.  It is why I salute Australia -- outside of NATO, the largest contributor of troops to this vital mission.  And itâs why we honor all those who have served there for our security, including 32 Australian patriots who gave their lives, among them Captain Bryce Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt, and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin.  We will honor their sacrifice by making sure that Afghanistan is never again used as a source for attacks against our people.  Never again. 

As two global partners, we stand up for the security and the dignity of people around the world.  We see it when our rescue workers rush to help others in times of fire and drought and flooding rains.  We see it when we partner to keep the peace -- from East Timor to the Balkans -- and when we pursue our shared vision:  a world without nuclear weapons.  We see it in the development that lifts up a child in Africa; the assistance that saves a family from famine; and when we extend our support to the people of the Middle East and North Africa, who deserve the same liberty that allows us to gather in this great hall of democracy.

This is the alliance we reaffirm today -- rooted in our values; renewed by every generation.  This is the partnership we worked to deepen over the past three years.  And today I can stand before you and say with confidence that the alliance between the United States and Australia has never been stronger. It has been to our past; our alliance continues to be indispensable to our future.  So here, among close friends, Iâd like to address the larger purpose of my visit to this region -- our efforts to advance security, prosperity and human dignity across the Asia Pacific.

For the United States, this reflects a broader shift.  After a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region.  In just a few weeks, after nearly nine years, the last American troops will leave Iraq and our war there will be over.  In Afghanistan, weâve begun a transition -- a responsible transition -- so Afghans can take responsibility for their future and so coalition forces can begin to draw down.  And with partners like Australia, weâve struck major blows against al Qaeda and put that terrorist organization on the path to defeat, including delivering justice to Osama bin Laden.

So make no mistake, the tide of war is receding, and America is looking ahead to the future that we must build.  From Europe to the Americas, we've strengthened alliances and partnerships.  At home, weâre investing in the sources of our long-term economic strength -- the education of our children, the training of our workers, the infrastructure that fuels commerce, the science and the research that leads to new breakthroughs.  Weâve made hard decisions to cut our deficit and put our fiscal house in order -- and we will continue to do more.  Because our economic strength at home is the foundation of our leadership in the world, including here in the Asia Pacific.  

Our new focus on this region reflects a fundamental truth -- the United States has been, and always will be, a Pacific nation. Asian immigrants helped build America, and millions of American families, including my own, cherish our ties to this region.  From the bombing of Darwin to the liberation of Pacific islands, from the rice paddies of Southeast Asia to a cold Korean Peninsula, generations of Americans have served here, and died here -- so democracies could take root; so economic miracles could lift hundreds of millions to prosperity.  Americans have bled with you for this progress, and we will not allow it -- we will never allow it to be reversed.

Here, we see the future.  As the worldâs fastest-growing region -- and home to more than half the global economy -- the Asia Pacific is critical to achieving my highest priority, and that's creating jobs and opportunity for the American people.  With most of the worldâs nuclear power and some half of humanity, Asia will largely define whether the century ahead will be marked by conflict or cooperation, needless suffering or human progress. 

As President, I have, therefore, made a deliberate and strategic decision -- as a Pacific nation, the United States will play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future, by upholding core principles and in close partnership with our allies and friends.

Let me tell you what this means.  First, we seek security, which is the foundation of peace and prosperity.  We stand for an international order in which the rights and responsibilities of all nations and all people are upheld.  Where international law and norms are enforced.  Where commerce and freedom of navigation are not impeded.  Where emerging powers contribute to regional security, and where disagreements are resolved peacefully.  That's the future that we seek.

Now, I know that some in this region have wondered about Americaâs commitment to upholding these principles.  So let me address this directly.  As the United States puts our fiscal house in order, we are reducing our spending.  And, yes, after a decade of extraordinary growth in our military budgets -- and as we definitively end the war in Iraq, and begin to wind down the war in Afghanistan -- we will make some reductions in defense spending.

As we consider the future of our armed forces, we've begun a review that will identify our most important strategic interests and guide our defense priorities and spending over the coming decade.  So here is what this region must know.  As we end todayâs wars, I have directed my national security team to make our presence and mission in the Asia Pacific a top priority.  As a result, reductions in U.S. defense spending will not -- I repeat, will not -- come at the expense of the Asia Pacific. 

My guidance is clear.  As we plan and budget for the future, we will allocate the resources necessary to maintain our strong military presence in this region.  We will preserve our unique ability to project power and deter threats to peace.  We will keep our commitments, including our treaty obligations to allies like Australia.  And we will constantly strengthen our capabilities to meet the needs of the 21st century.  Our enduring interests in the region demand our enduring presence in the region.  The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay.

Indeed, we are already modernizing Americaâs defense posture across the Asia Pacific.  It will be more broadly distributed -- maintaining our strong presence in Japan and the Korean Peninsula, while enhancing our presence in Southeast Asia.  Our posture will be more flexible -- with new capabilities to ensure that our forces can operate freely.  And our posture will be more sustainable, by helping allies and partners build their capacity, with more training and exercises.

We see our new posture here in Australia.  The initiatives that the Prime Minister and I announced yesterday will bring our two militaries even closer together.  Weâll have new opportunities to train with other allies and partners, from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean.  And it will allow us to respond faster to the full range of challenges, including humanitarian crises and disaster relief.

Since World War II, Australians have warmly welcomed American service members who've passed through.  On behalf of the American people, I thank you for welcoming those who will come next, as they ensure that our alliance stays strong and ready for the tests of our time.

We see Americaâs enhanced presence in the alliance that weâve strengthened:  In Japan, where our alliance remains a cornerstone of regional security.  In Thailand, where weâre partnering for disaster relief.  In the Philippines, where weâre increasing ship visits and training.  And in South Korea, where our commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea will never waver.  Indeed, we also reiterate our resolve to act firmly against any proliferation activities by North Korea.  The transfer of nuclear materials or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States and our allies, and we would hold North Korea fully accountable for the consequences of such action.

We see Americaâs enhanced presence across Southeast Asia -- in our partnership with Indonesia against piracy and violent extremism, and in our work with Malaysia to prevent proliferation; in the ships weâll deploy to Singapore, and in our closer cooperation with Vietnam and Cambodia; and in our welcome of India as it âlooks eastâ and plays a larger role as an Asian power.

At the same time, weâll reengage with our regional organizations.  Our work in Bali this week will mark my third meeting with ASEAN leaders, and Iâll be proud to be the first American President to attend the East Asia Summit.  And together, I believe we can address shared challenges, such as proliferation and maritime security, including cooperation in the South China Sea.

Meanwhile, the United States will continue our effort to build a cooperative relationship with China.  All of our nations -- Australia, the United States -- all of our nations have a profound interest in the rise of a peaceful and prosperous China. That's why the United States welcomes it.  Weâve seen that China can be a partner from reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula to preventing proliferation.  And weâll seek more opportunities for cooperation with Beijing, including greater communication between our militaries to promote understanding and avoid miscalculation.  We will do this, even as we continue to speak candidly to Beijing about the importance of upholding international norms and respecting the universal human rights of the Chinese people.

A secure and peaceful Asia is the foundation for the second area in which America is leading again, and that's advancing our shared prosperity.  History teaches us the greatest force the world has ever known for creating wealth and opportunity is free markets.  So we seek economies that are open and transparent.  We seek trade that is free and fair.  And we seek an open international economic system, where rules are clear and every nation plays by them.

In Australia and America, we understand these principles.  Weâre among the most open economies on Earth.  Six years into our landmark trade agreement, commerce between us has soared.  Our workers are creating new partnerships and new products, like the advanced aircraft technologies we build together in Victoria.  Weâre the leading investor in Australia, and you invest more in America than you do in any other nation, creating good jobs in both countries.

We recognize that economic partnerships canât just be about one nation extracting anotherâs resources.  We understand that no long-term strategy for growth can be imposed from above.  Real prosperity -- prosperity that fosters innovation, and prosperity that endures -- comes from unleashing our greatest economic resource, and thatâs the entrepreneurial spirit, the talents of our people.

So even as America competes aggressively in Asian markets, weâre forging the economic partnerships that create opportunity for all.  Building on our historic trade agreement with South Korea, weâre working with Australia and our other APEC partners to create a seamless regional economy.  And with Australia and other partners, weâre on track to achieve our most ambitious trade agreement yet, and a potential model for the entire region -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

The United States remains the worldâs largest and most dynamic economy.  But in an interconnected world, we all rise and fall together.  Thatâs why I pushed so hard to put the G20 at the front and center of global economic decision-making -- to give more nations a leadership role in managing the international economy, including Australia.  And together, we saved the world economy from a depression.  And now, our urgent challenge is to create the growth that puts people to work.

We need growth that is fair, where every nation plays by the rules; where workers rights are respected, and our businesses can compete on a level playing field; where the intellectual property and new technologies that fuel innovation are protected; and where currencies are market driven so no nation has an unfair advantage.

We also need growth that is broad -- not just for the few, but for the many -- with reforms that protect consumers from abuse and a global commitment to end the corruption that stifles growth.  We need growth that is balanced, because we will all prosper more when countries with large surpluses take action to boost demand at home.

And we need growth that is sustainable.  This includes the clean energy that creates green jobs and combats climate change, which cannot be denied.  We see it in the stronger fires, the devastating floods, the Pacific islands confronting rising seas. And as countries with large carbon footprints, the United States and Australia have a special responsibility to lead.

Every nation will contribute to the solution in its own way -- and I know this issue is not without controversy, in both our countries.  But what we can do -- and what we are doing -- is to work together to make unprecedented investments in clean energy, to increase energy efficiency, and to meet the commitments we made at Copenhagen and Cancun.  We can do this, and we will.

As we grow our economies, weâll also remember the link between growth and good governance -- the rule of law, transparent institutions, the equal administration of justice.  Because history shows that, over the long run, democracy and economic growth go hand in hand.  And prosperity without freedom is just another form of poverty.

And this brings me to the final area where we are leading -- our support for the fundamental rights of every human being.  Every nation will chart its own course.  Yet it is also true that certain rights are universal; among them, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, and the freedom of citizens to choose their own leaders.

These are not American rights, or Australian rights, or Western rights.  These are human rights.  They stir in every soul, as weâve seen in the democracies that have succeeded here in Asia.  Other models have been tried and they have failed -- fascism and communism, rule by one man and rule by committee.  And they failed for the same simple reason:  They ignore the ultimate source of power and legitimacy -- the will of the people.  Yes, democracy can be messy and rough -- I understand you mix it up quite well during Question Time.  But whatever our differences of party or of ideology, we know in our democracies we are blessed with the greatest form of government ever known to man.

So as two great democracies, we speak up for those freedoms when they are threatened.  We partner with emerging democracies, like Indonesia, to help strengthen the institutions upon which good governance depends.  We encourage open government, because democracies depend on an informed and active citizenry.  We help strengthen civil societies, because they empower our citizens to hold their governments accountable.  And we advance the rights of all people -- women, minorities and indigenous cultures -- because when societies harness the potential of all their citizens, these societies are more successful, they are more prosperous and they are more just.

These principles have guided our approach to Burma, with a combination of sanctions and engagement.  And today, Aung San Suu Kyi is free from house arrest.  Some political prisoners have been released, and the government has begun a dialogue.  Still, violations of human rights persist.  So we will continue to speak clearly about the steps that must be taken for the government of Burma to have a better relationship with the United States.

This is the future we seek in the Asia Pacific -- security, prosperity and dignity for all.  Thatâs what we stand for.  Thatâs who we are.  Thatâs the future we will pursue, in partnership with allies and friends, and with every element of American power.  So let there be no doubt:  In the Asia Pacific in the 21st century, the United States of America is all in.

Still, in times of great change and uncertainty, the future can seem unsettling.  Across a vast ocean, itâs impossible to know what lies beyond the horizon.  But if this vast region and its people teach us anything, itâs the yearning for liberty and progress will not be denied.

Itâs why women in this country demanded that their voices be heard, making Australia the first nation to let women vote and run for parliament and, one day, become Prime Minister.  Itâs why the people took to the streets -- from Delhi to Seoul, from Manila to Jakarta -- to throw off colonialism and dictatorship and build some of the worldâs largest democracies.

Itâs why a soldier in a watchtower along the DMZ defends a free people in the South, and why a man from the North risks his life to escape across the border.  Why soldiers in blue helmets keep the peace in a new nation.  And why women of courage go into brothels to save young girls from modern-day slavery, which must come to an end.

Itâs why men of peace in saffron robes faced beatings and bullets, and why every day -- from some of the worldâs largest cities to dusty rural towns, in small acts of courage the world may never see -- a student posts a blog; a citizen signs a charter; an activist remains unbowed, imprisoned in his home, just to have the same rights that we cherish here today.

Men and women like these know what the world must never forget.  The currents of history may ebb and flow, but over time they move -- decidedly, decisively -- in a single direction.  History is on the side of the free -- free societies, free governments, free economies, free people.  And the future belongs to those who stand firm for those ideals, in this region and around the world.

This is the story of the alliance we celebrate today.  This is the essence of Americaâs leadership; it is the essence of our partnership.  This is the work we will carry on together, for the security and prosperity and dignity of all people. 

So God bless Australia.  God bless America.  And God bless the friendship between our two peoples.

Thank you very much.
","President Barack Obama laid out a sweeping vision of a U.S. newly committed to Asia and the Pacific, promising to ramp up American economic and military engagement despite the federal budget problems confronting him back in Washington.

In his first trip as president to Australia, Mr. Obama said U.S. Marines would be stationed permanently on Australia's north coast beginning next year, a gesture to Southeast Asian nations looking to U.S. authority to counter China's influence in the region.

""The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay,"" he said Thursday in remarks to the Australian Parliament.

Mr. Obama vowed to address a wide range of issues confronting the region, including the territorial disputes engulfing the South China Sea, an issue that has emerged as an important subtext of his weeklong Asian trip.

U.S. officials back countries that dispute China's claims to the resource-laden sea, and the president described the conflict as a ""shared challenge,"" along with maritime security and proliferation of weapons.

The Chinese government doesn't want the South China Sea issue to be raised during the East Asian Summit later this week in Bali, but the Obama administration has made it clear it intends to air the issue.

""The U.S. is standing up for norms like freedom of navigation that other nations support,"" said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama.

Mr. Obama said he had directed his national-security team to make the U.S. mission in the Asia-Pacific region a ""top priority"" as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down and vowed to allocate resources necessary to maintain a strong military presence in the region, while preserving America's ""unique ability to project power and deter threats to peace.""

""Reductions in U.S. defense spending will not -- I repeat, will not -- come at the expense of the Asia Pacific,"" he said in his speech to Parliament, reiterating a pledge first made last month by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

The White House wasn't specific about how the president would prioritize the region in future budgeting.

It was unclear, for instance, whether the region would see increased spending, flat funding or reductions that are simply less severe than those planned elsewhere.

Overall, the Pentagon is preparing $450 billion in spending cuts over the next decade, and faces cuts twice that amount if a congressional committee fails to come up with a deficit-reduction plan and automatic cuts are triggered.

The speech culminated months of signals by senior administration officials that Washington is turning more of its attention toward the Asia-Pacific region as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down.

Mr. Obama said he had made a ""deliberate and strategic decision"" to focus on the region.

""As a Pacific nation, the United States will play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future, by upholding core principles and in close partnership with allies and friends,"" he said.

His vision for U.S. leadership included economic engagement as well, and the president said the U.S. would press all nations to abide international rules to promote free and fair trade. In a clear shot toward China, he said currencies must be market-driven, ""so no nation has an unfair advantage.""

Mr. Obama's whirlwind trip was to have him in the country for just about 27 hours.","President Obama announced Wednesday that the United States planned to deploy 2,500 Marines in Australia to shore up alliances in Asia, but the move prompted a sharp response from Beijing, which accused Mr. Obama of escalating military tensions in the region.

The agreement with Australia amounts to the first long-term expansion of the American military's presence in the Pacific since the end of the Vietnam War. It comes despite budget cuts facing the Pentagon and an increasingly worried reaction from Chinese leaders, who have argued that the United States is seeking to encircle China militarily and economically.

""It may not be quite appropriate to intensify and expand military alliances and may not be in the interest of countries within this region,"" Liu Weimin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in response to the announcement by Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia.

In an address to the Australian Parliament on Thursday morning, Mr. Obama said he had ""made a deliberate and strategic decision -- as a Pacific nation, the United States will play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future.""

The president said the moves were not intended to isolate China, but they were an unmistakable sign that the United States had grown warier of its intentions.

China has invested heavily in military modernization and has begun to deploy long-range aircraft and a more able deep-sea naval force, and it has asserted territorial claims to disputed islands that would give it broad sway over oil and gas rights in the East and South China Seas.

While the new military commitment is relatively modest, Mr. Obama has promoted it as the cornerstone of a strategy to confront more directly the challenge posed by China's rapid advance as an economic and military power. He has also made some progress in creating a new Pacific free-trade zone that would give America's free-market allies in the region some trading privileges that do not immediately extend to China.

Mr. Obama described the deployment as responding to the wishes of democratic allies in the region, from Japan to India. Some allies have expressed concerns that the United States, facing war fatigue and a slackened economy, will cede its leadership role to China.

The president said budget-cutting in Washington -- and the inevitable squeeze on military spending -- would not inhibit his ability to follow through. Defense cuts ""will not -- I repeat, will not -- come at the expense of the Asia-Pacific,"" he said.

Some analysts in China and elsewhere say they fear that the moves could backfire, risking a cold war-style standoff with China.

""I don't think they're going to be very happy,"" said Mark Valencia, a Hawaii-based senior researcher at the National Bureau of Asian Research, who said the new policy was months in the making. ""I'm not optimistic in the long run as to how this is going to wind up.""

The president is to fly north across the continent to Darwin, a frontier port and military outpost across the Timor Sea from Indonesia, which will be the center of operations for the coming deployment. The first 200 to 250 Marines will arrive next year, with forces rotating in and out and eventually building up to 2,500, the two leaders said.

The United States will not build new bases on the continent, but will use Australian facilities instead. Mr. Obama said that Marines would rotate through for joint training and exercises with Australians, and the American Air Force would have increased access to airfields in the nation's Northern Territory.

""We're going to be in a position to more effectively strengthen the security of both of our nations and this region,"" he said.

The United States has had military bases and large forces in Japan and South Korea, in the north Pacific, since the end of World War II, but its presence in Southeast Asia was greatly diminished in the early 1990s with the closing of major bases in the Philippines, at Clark Field and Subic Bay. The new arrangement with Australia will restore a substantial American footprint near the South China Sea, a major commercial route -- including for American exports -- that has been roiled by China's disputed claims of control.

The United States and other Pacific Rim nations are also negotiating to create a free-trade bloc, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that would not initially include China, the world's largest exporter and producer of manufactured goods.

The tentative trade agreement was a topic over the weekend in Honolulu, where Mr. Obama hosted the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and it will be discussed again later this week when he becomes the first American president to participate in the East Asia Summit meeting, on the Indonesian island of Bali.

For China, the week's developments could suggest both an economic and a military encirclement. Top leaders did not immediately comment on Mr. Obama's speech, but Mr. Liu, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, emphasized that it was the United States, not China, seeking to use military power to influence events in Asia.

The Global Times, a state-run news organization known for its nationalist and bellicose commentaries, issued a stronger reaction in an editorial, saying that Australia should be cautious about allowing the United States to use bases there to ""harm China"" and that it risked getting ""caught in the cross-fire.""

Analysts say that Chinese leaders have been caught off guard by what they view as an American campaign to stir up discontent in the region. China may have miscalculated in recent years by restating longstanding territorial claims that would give it broad sway over development rights in the South China Sea, they say. But they argue that Beijing has not sought to project military power far beyond its shores, and has repeatedly proposed to resolve territorial disputes through negotiations.

The United States portrays itself as responding to a new Chinese assertiveness in the region that has alarmed core American allies. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote a recent article in Foreign Policy laying out an expansive case for American involvement in Asia, and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta characterized China's military development as lacking transparency and criticized its assertiveness in the regional waters.

Mr. Obama reached out to China even as he announced the new troop deployment. ""The notion that we fear China is mistaken; the notion that we are looking to exclude China is mistaken,"" he said.

The president said that China would be welcomed into the new trade pact if Beijing was willing to meet the free-trade standards for membership. But such standards would require China to let its currency rise in value, to better protect foreign producers' intellectual property rights and to limit or end subsidies to state-owned companies, all of which would require a major overhaul of China's economic development strategy.

Mr. Obama canceled two previous planned trips to Australia because of domestic demands; he recalled Wednesday at a state dinner that he had visited the country twice as a boy, when his mother was working in Indonesia on development programs.

This time, as president, Mr. Obama arrived at Parliament House to a 21-gun salute and, once inside, to the enthusiastic greeting of Australians crowding the galleries of the vast marble entrance hall.

The two countries have been allies for decades, and cooperated closely in World War II, when there were several dozen American air and naval bases and army camps in the country and Australian combat troops served under American command.

Another purpose of Mr. Obama's visit is to celebrate those ties. ""The United States has no stronger ally,"" Mr. Obama said.

Australians fought alongside Americans in every war of the 20th century, and more recently have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The war in Afghanistan has become increasingly unpopular here, though, and most Australians want their troops to come home immediately.",2011-11-17,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.990, NEU: 0.009, NEG: 0.001})",0.9900043606758118,0.00868834089487791,0.0013073404552415013,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.841, NEU: 0.157, NEG: 0.002})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.903, NEG: 0.078, POS: 0.020})",0.841344952583313,0.1568087637424469,0.001846308819949627,0.01987149938941002,0.9025776386260986,0.07755088806152344
37,37,2011-12-16-EndIraqWar.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody. As a candidate for President, I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end, for the sake of our national security and to strengthen American leadership around the world. After taking office, I announced a new strategy that would end our combat mission in Iraq and remove all of our troops by the end of 2011.

As Commander in Chief, ensuring the success of this strategy has been one of my highest national security priorities. Last year, I announced the end to our combat mission in Iraq. And to date, we've removed more than 100,000 troops. Iraqis have taken full responsibility for their country's security.

A few hours ago, I spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki. I reaffirmed that the United States keeps its commitments. He spoke of the determination of the Iraqi people to forge their own future. We are in full agreement about how to move forward.

So today I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly 9 years, America's war in Iraq will be over.

Over the next 2 months, our troops in Iraq--tens of thousands of them--will pack up their gear and board convoys for the journey home. The last American soldier [soldiers]* will cross the border out of Iraq with their held--heads held high, proud of their success, and knowing that the American people stand united in our support for our troops. That is how America's military efforts in Iraq will end.

But even as we mark this important milestone, we're also moving into a new phase in the relationship between the United States and Iraq. As of January 1 and in keeping with our strategic framework agreement with Iraq, it will be a normal relationship between sovereign nations, an equal partnership based on mutual interests and mutual respect.

In today's conversation, Prime Minister Maliki and I agreed that a meeting of the Higher Coordinating Committee of the strategic framework agreement will convene in the coming weeks. And I invited the Prime Minister to come to the White House in December, as we plan for all the important work that we have to do together. This will be a strong and enduring partnership. With our diplomats and civilian advisers in the lead, we'll help Iraqis strengthen institutions that are just, representative, and accountable. We'll build new ties of trade and of commerce, culture and education that unleash the potential of the Iraqi people. We'll partner with an Iraq that contributes to regional security and peace, just as we insist that other nations respect Iraq's sovereignty.

As I told Prime Minister Maliki, we will continue discussions on how we might help Iraq train and equip its forces, again, just as we offer training and assistance to countries around the world. After all, there will be some difficult days ahead for Iraq, and the United States will continue to have an interest in an Iraq that is stable, secure, and self-reliant. Just as Iraqis have persevered through war, I'm confident that they can build a future worthy of their history as a cradle of civilization.

Here at home, the coming months will be another season of homecomings. Across America, our service men and women will be reunited with their families. Today I can say that our troops in Iraq will definitely be home for the holidays.

This December will be a time to reflect on all that we've been though in this war. I'll join the American people in paying tribute to the more than 1 million Americans who have served in Iraq. We'll honor our many wounded warriors and the nearly 4,500 American patriots--and their Iraqi and coalition partners--who gave their lives to this effort.

And finally, I would note that the end of war in Iraq reflects a larger transition. The tide of war is receding. The drawdown in Iraq allowed us to refocus our fight against Al Qaida and achieve major victories against its leadership, including Usama bin Laden. Now, even as we remove our last troops from Iraq, we're beginning to bring our troops home from Afghanistan, where we've begun a transition to Afghan security in [and]* leadership. When I took office, roughly 180,000 troops were deployed in both these wars. And by the end of this year that number will be cut in half. And make no mistake: It will continue to go down.

Meanwhile, yesterday marked the definitive end of the Qadhafi regime in Libya. And there too, our military played a critical role in shaping a situation on the ground in which the Libyan people can build their own future. Today, NATO is working to bring this successful mission to a close.

So to sum up, the United States is moving forward from a position of strength. The long war in Iraq will come to an end by the end of this year. The transition in Afghanistan is moving forward, and our troops are finally coming home. As they do, fewer deployments and more time training will help keep our military the very best in the world. And as we welcome home our newest veterans, we'll never stop working to give them and their families the care, the benefits, and the opportunities that they have earned.

This includes enlisting our veterans in the greatest challenge that we now face as a nation: creating opportunity and jobs in this country. Because after a decade of war, the nation that we need to build--and the nation that we will build--is our own, an America that sees its economic strength restored just as we've restored our leadership around the globe.

Thank you very much.
","After nearly nine years of war, tens of thousands of Iraqi and American casualties -- including 4,487 Americans dead -- and more than $800 billion spent, the U.S. military formally ended its mission and prepared to leave the country.

Many Iraqis seemed either unaware of Thursday's official closing ceremony, or didn't fully believe U.S. troops were leaving.

Nonetheless, U.S. military and defense officials marked the end of their mission in a tradition-steeped observance held in a protected area within Baghdad International Airport, as Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, took down the flag that symbolized the American mission and soldiers prepared it for a journey home.

""No words, no ceremony, can provide full tribute to the sacrifices that brought this day to pass,"" Leon Panetta, the defense secretary, said.

In the coming days, the last of the 4,000 U.S. military personnel still in Iraq will follow the flag and head home -- leaving fewer than 200 to serve as part of the diplomatic mission.

But as the last units were departing, tensions flared up among Iraqis, and unresolved issues -- over regional efforts for greater autonomy, dividing the country's oil wealth and establishing an impartial judicial system among them -- were clear.

The dual-dynamic underscored the uncertainty and anxiety about the U.S. pullout in both nations and pointed to the array of political and security challenges that now confront Iraq's leaders.

The job of assisting them will be left to a U.S. diplomatic mission that is the biggest in the world and includes thousands of private security contractors and other support personnel.

Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's office issued a terse statement announcing his return to Baghdad from Washington on Thursday amid an intensifying crisis over a proposed move by some predominantly Sunni provinces to become semiautonomous regions.

Sunni-Shiite divisions were evident in reactions to the official end of the U.S. mission. In the Sunni bastion of Adhamiya on Baghdad's northwestern side, residents complained about excessive checkpoints and protective walls, relics of the U.S. troop surge in 2008.

Others spoke about the frequent nightly raids by Iraqi security forces in Adhamiya, which residents said suffers from a reputation as a onetime haven for former Sunni regime loyalists and insurgents. A recently released detainee with visible marks of beating on his face declined to be interviewed.

""I think the withdrawal is a lie and the Americans are still present, their concrete walls are still here and so are their towers and communications wires,"" said Tariq Adnan, 27, owner of a hardware store in Adhamiya.

In Fallujah, the predominantly Sunni Arab city west of Baghdad where U.S. soldiers and Marines fought some of the bloodiest battles of the war, people gathered for a memorial Thursday at a football stadium turned into a cemetery for hundreds of residents who perished in the war.

The mood was different in Sadr City, a predominantly Shiite district of Baghdad renamed after the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003 in honor of a revered clerical family that includes the father of anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

Most shopkeepers in Sadr City were busy watching a soccer match Thursday and paid scant attention to the U.S. ceremony.

""We started to know Sunni and Shiite only after the arrival of the Americans in our country,"" said Ali Mohammed, 23, a cellphone shop owner. ""We want to prove to the world that we are one -- and especially Iran, because it's trying directly to destabilize Iraq.""

There was no reaction from Mr. Sadr, one of the fiercest opponents to the U.S. presence in Iraq. His movement's website posted a statement from Mr. Sadr dated Monday lambasting Mr. Maliki for his visit to the U.S. and meeting with President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials earlier in the week.

""It's contrary to the blood that was spilled on the homeland's soil because of the occupation and its soldiers,"" wrote Mr. Sadr.

The military has largely shut its main base in western Baghdad, Camp Victory -- a name that often had a bitterly ironic ring for many service members -- and held the final ceremony at Baghdad International Airport.

Gen. Austin reflected on how, as an assistant division commander, he gave the order for the lead elements of the 3rd Infantry division to cross into Iraq eight years, eight months and 26 days earlier.

""As fate would have it, I now give the order to case the colors,"" Gen. Austin said, referring to a long-established military ritual in which regiments ""uncase"" their identifying colors when arriving for deployments, and ""case"" them when they pack up to leave.

The Iraq war has become a defining experience for a generation of officers, including all of the top generals in the Pentagon. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who previously served two tours in Iraq, called the war a ""test of our character.""

""Every day required us to balance conflict and compassion,"" Gen. Dempsey said. ""Every step was a singular act of moral and physical courage.""

At Thursday's ceremony, Mr. Panetta evoked the most important battles of the war in Fallujah, Ramadi and Sadr City. He returned to a theme he has struck all week while visiting troops in Djibouti, Afghanistan and Iraq: American service members have given Iraqis the opportunity to make their own future. The hardships and losses endured by America's military, he said, weren't in vain because they led to a free Iraq.

""You leave with great pride, lasting pride, secure in knowing that your sacrifice has helped the Iraqi people begin a new chapter in history,"" Mr. Panetta said.","At a crowded market in the city center here, the flotsam of the war is for sale. Ripped Fuel workout supplement. Ready-to-eat meals, macaroni and cheese ""Mexican style."" Pistol holsters. Nothing seems off limits to the merchants out for a quick dinar, not even a bottle of prescription pills from a pharmacy in Waco, Tex., probably tossed out by a departing soldier.

The concrete blast walls that shielded the shopping stalls have lately come down. Since then, three explosions have struck the market, killing several people.

""This will be an easy target for car bombs,"" said Muhammad Ali, a merchant who lost two brothers during the cruelest times of the conflict. ""People will die here.""

After nearly nine years, about 4,500 American fatalities and $1 trillion, America's war in Iraq is about to end. Officials marked the finish on Thursday with a modest ceremony at the airport days before the last troops take the southern highway to Kuwait, going out as they came in, to conclude the United States' most ambitious and bloodiest military campaign since Vietnam.

For the United States, the war leaves an uncertain legacy as Americans weigh what may have been accomplished against the price paid, with so many dead and wounded. The Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, was vanquished, but the failure to find illicit weapons undermined the original rationale, leaving a bitter taste as casualties mounted. The lengthy conflict and repeated deployments strained the country and its resources, raising questions about America's willingness to undertake future wars on such a grand scale.

Iraqis will be left with a country that is not exactly at war, and not exactly at peace. It has improved in many ways since the 2007 troop ""surge,"" but it is still a shattered country marred by violence and political dysfunction, a land defined on sectarian lines whose future, for better or worse, is now in the hands of its people.

""It is the end for the Americans only,"" Emad Risn, an Iraqi columnist, recently wrote in Assabah al-Jadeed, a government-financed newspaper. ""Nobody knows if the war will end for Iraqis, too.""

Iraq will now be on its own both to find its place in a region upended by revolutions and to manage its rivalry with Iran, which will look to expand its influence culturally and economically in the power vacuum left by the United States military. While American officials worry about the close political ties between Iraq's Shiite leadership and Iran, the picture at the grass-roots level is more nuanced. Iraqis complain about shoddy Iranian consumer goods -- they frequently mention low-quality yogurts and cheeses -- and the menacing role of Iranian-backed militias, which this year killed many American soldiers.

Failed Reconciliation

The Iranian rivalry frequently plays out in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, where Iraq's religious authorities are based. Iran, which like Iraq is majority Shiite, recently installed one of its leading clerics in Najaf, raising worries that Iran is trying to spread its brand of clerical rule to Iraq. Meanwhile, Moktada al-Sadr, an anti-American cleric with very close ties to Iran, has recently said that with the military withdrawal, American diplomats are now fair game for his militiamen.

Iraq faces a multitude of vexing problems the Americans tried and failed to resolve, from how to divide the country's oil wealth to sectarian reconciliation to the establishment of an impartial justice system. A longstanding dispute festers in the north over how to share power in Kirkuk between Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen, an ominous harbinger for power struggles that may ensue in a post-America Iraq. A recent deal between Exxon Mobil and the Kurdistan government in the north has been deemed illegal by Baghdad in the absence of procedures for sharing the country's oil resources.

""We are in a standstill and things are paralyzed,"" said Adel Abdul Mahdi, a prominent Shiite politician and former vice president of Iraq, describing the process of political reconciliation among Iraq's three main factions, Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. ""We are going from bad to worse.""

A surprising number of Iraqis refuse to believe that the Americans are really leaving, the effect of a conspiratorial mind-set developed over years living under the violent and repressive dictatorship of Mr. Hussein, and a view of history informed by the Crusades, colonialism and other perceived injustices at the hands of the West.

Rani Basil, who drives a taxi in the capital, said, ""Iraq will be a great place if the U.S. withdraws,"" but he does not believe that it will. ""I do not think the United States will leave Iraq, because they are about to attack Iran,"" he said.

In Falluja, where years of block-to-block urban combat left behind a city that its Sunni residents refer to as Iraq's Hiroshima, residents celebrated the withdrawal with a day of public demonstrations, angry speeches, the burning of American flags and a gallery exhibition of photos of mangled children, destroyed homes and other signposts of what residents call the bitter legacy of the American invasion.

""It's a huge happiness that the Americans are getting out,"" said Mohammed Adnan, 35. ""Hopefully, we are all going to be fine, we Iraqis. We were doing fine before 2003.""

Not everyone was doing fine before 2003. After a failed Shiite uprising at the close of the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Mr. Hussein executed tens of thousands of people, mostly Kurds and Shiites. International sanctions destroyed the economy, creating mass poverty and crime. The dictatorship inflicted deep wounds to the collective psyche, which partially explains why the American invasion unleashed so many unforeseen consequences, from sectarian violence to a winner-take-all political culture.

""If you go to Basra and go house to house, wives will say that their husband disappeared,"" said Jana Hybaskova, the European Union's ambassador to Iraq. ""The level of destruction of society was a million times deeper than anyone expected.""

Experts estimate that the remains of 250,000 to one million Iraqis lie in mass graves around the country, victims of the Hussein government. Not a single victim has been identified by DNA analysis, partly because various government ministries and the two factions with the greatest claims of victimhood -- the Kurds and Shiites -- have been unable to agree on how to proceed. The lack of a painful but cathartic process of reckoning with its history -- as South Africa and other countries have done -- has stymied Iraqi society's ability to vanquish the ghosts of its past.

While more than 100,000 Iraqi civilians perished in the war and its aftermath, violence has decreased significantly since 2007, when there were almost 7,500 attacks a month.

But Iraq remains an extremely dangerous place. According to the American military, there were 500 to 750 attacks a month this year, including bombings, rocket attacks and assassinations. There are still roughly a dozen insurgent groups and militias active in Iraq: Sunni groups made up of former members of the ruling Baath Party and the homegrown insurgent group, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia; and Shiite militias supported by Iran and Mr. Sadr, the anti-American cleric.

Progress in Small Steps

While the violence has declined, sectarian rifts still have not healed. American officials worry that a large attack on a Shiite shrine could trigger a new round of sectarian bloodletting. It remains unclear whether Iraq's security forces are loyal to their nation or their sect. In Abu Ghraib, the Sunni stronghold outside Baghdad, residents complain about harassment by the Shiite-dominated security forces and say they fear them more than insurgents. Local police and army outposts fly the flag of Imam Hussein, the revered Shiite martyr.

""It's been papered over,"" Joost R. Hiltermann, of the International Crisis Group, said of the sectarian divides. ""There has been no reconciliation whatsoever.""

The war opened Iraq's tremendous petroleum reserves to foreign investment for the first time since 1974, though American companies did poorly in the postwar auctions. So far, the Ministry of Oil has granted 12 licenses for fields in the south to companies from Britain, China, South Korea, the Netherlands, Russia and elsewhere, with just one going to an American company, Exxon Mobil. The outcome helped defuse criticism that the United States had invaded Iraq for its oil.

Yet, Iraq's oil output still has not rebounded to the level it was in the late 1970s, according to the International Energy Agency. The Iraqi government's stated goal of raising output to 12 million barrels a day by 2017, from the current 2.95 million barrels a day, is regarded as unattainable by some analysts.

Aesthetically, Baghdad is still a war zone of checkpoints, blast walls and coils of razor wire, where buildings sit partially destroyed from the first wave of bombings that President George W. Bush called ""shock and awe."" At entrances to the garrisoned heart of the central government, the Green Zone, vehicles on the way in are searched for bombs, and on the way out for kidnapping victims. And most Iraqis still receive only a few hours of electricity a day, forcing many to sleep on their rooftops during sweltering summer nights.

Iraq has improved in some respects. Life in Baghdad has blossomed in recent years -- street life has returned, markets are bustling, a new amusement park is opening and even the circus came to town this year. The government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, while hamstrung by sectarian infighting, was chosen in elections last year that international monitors declared as free.

Melancholia and Hope

On the garbage-strewn banks of the Tigris River, a group of young men who lived abroad during the bad days now gather on Fridays to ride their Jet Skis, arriving in the early afternoon and staying until the sun goes down. They drink Tuborg beer and Chivas whiskey, and listen to American pop and rap music.

""When I'm on the Jet Ski on the Tigris, I forget all the explosions and the politics, everything,"" said Khaldi Nuami, who owns an import-export company whose primary product is armored cars.

A palpable sense of melancholy pervades Iraq. The war opened a generational divide that splits older Iraqis, who recall a brief golden age in the 1960s and 1970s, from younger ones, who are drawn more to the culture and ideas the Americans tried to import here.

""In the 1960s, life was good,"" said Qassim Jasim, who has baked bread at the Abu Naseer Bakery in Adhamiya, a Sunni enclave in the capital, for 38 years. During the war, he said, ""when I used to go out and see the dead bodies, I would cry for what it used to be like here.""

His neighborhood is no longer a bloody battleground controlled by Al Qaeda. But the Shiites have mostly left. The fabric of the community has been forever altered. Ghaith Raad, whose family owns a well-known sweets shop across the street from the bakery, returned from Syria -- where he fled during the fighting -- about four months ago.

""When I came back, I didn't find any of my friends,"" he said. ""The society has changed here, the people have changed.""

The war opened Iraq to the outside world. For the first time, Iraqis had easy access to satellite television and the Internet. This allowed the pop singer known as Dali, who left Iraq in the 1990s as a child and became famous in the Arab world, to become a star in her own country. She recently returned for the first time since the war began, to perform and film a music video.

Over coffee in the lobby of the recently refurbished Ishtar Sheraton hotel, dressed in a purple Adidas track suit, she considered her homecoming.

""I can feel how Iraq has changed now, and how it is sad,"" she said. ""All of Iraq is sad.""",2011-12-16,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.777, NEU: 0.220, NEG: 0.004})",0.776785671710968,0.21965782344341278,0.003556490410119295,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.843, NEU: 0.153, POS: 0.003})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.862, NEU: 0.134, POS: 0.004})",0.0032383929938077927,0.1534569263458252,0.8433046936988831,0.0038340664468705654,0.13439270853996277,0.8617733120918274
38,38,2012-01-06-MilitaryPolicy.txt,"Good morning, everybody. The United States of America is the greatest force for freedom and security that the world has ever known. And in no small measure, that's because we've built the best-trained, best-led, best-equipped military in history -- and as Commander-in-Chief, I'm going to keep it that way. Indeed, all of us on this stage -- every single one of us -- have a profound responsibility to every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine and Coast Guardsman who puts their life on the line for America. We owe them a strategy with well-defined goals; to only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary; to give them the equipment and the support that they need to get the job done; and to care for them and their families when they come home. That is our solemn obligation. And over the past three years, that's what we've done. We've continued to make historic investments in our military -- our troops and their capabilities, our military families and our veterans. And thanks to their extraordinary service, we've ended our war in Iraq. We've decimated al Qaeda's leadership. We've delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, and we've put that terrorist network on the path to defeat. We've made important progress in Afghanistan, and we've begun to transition so Afghans can assume more responsibility for their own security. We joined allies and partners to protect the Libyan people as they ended the regime of Muammar Qaddafi. Now we're turning the page on a decade of war. Three years ago, we had some 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we've cut that number in half. And as the transition in Afghanistan continues, more of our troops will continue to come home. More broadly, around the globe we've strengthened alliances, forged new partnerships, and served as a force for universal rights and human dignity. In short, we've succeeded in defending our nation, taking the fight to our enemies, reducing the number of Americans in harm's way, and we've restored America's global leadership. That makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And that's an achievement that every American -- especially those Americans who are proud to wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces -- should take great pride in. This success has brought our nation, once more, to a moment of transition. Even as our troops continue to fight in Afghanistan, the tide of war is receding. Even as our forces prevail in today's missions, we have the opportunity -- and the responsibility -- to look ahead to the force that we are going to need in the future. At the same time, we have to renew our economic strength here at home, which is the foundation of our strength around the world. And that includes putting our fiscal house in order. To that end, the Budget Control Act passed by Congress last year -- with the support of Republicans and Democrats alike -- mandates reductions in federal spending, including defense spending. I've insisted that we do that responsibly. The security of our nation and the lives of our men and women in uniform depend on it. That's why I called for this comprehensive defense review -- to clarify our strategic interests in a fast-changing world, and to guide our defense priorities and spending over the coming decade -- because the size and the structure of our military and defense budgets have to be driven by a strategy, not the other way around. Moreover, we have to remember the lessons of history. We can't afford to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past -- after World War II, after Vietnam -- when our military was left ill prepared for the future. As Commander in Chief, I will not let that happen again. Not on my watch. We need a start -- we need a smart, strategic set of priorities. The new guidance that the Defense Department is releasing today does just that. I want to thank Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey for their extraordinary leadership during this process. I want to thank the service secretaries and chiefs, the combatant commanders and so many defense leaders -- military and civilian, active, Guard and reserve -- for their contributions. Many of us met repeatedly -- asking tough questions, challenging our own assumptions and making hard choices. And we've come together today around an approach that will keep our nation safe and our military the finest that the world have ever known. This review also benefits from the contributions of leaders from across my national security team -- from the departments of State, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, as well as the intelligence community. And this is critical, because meeting the challenges of our time cannot be the work of our military alone -- or the United States alone. It requires all elements of our national power, working together in concert with our allies and our partners. So I'm going to let Leon and Marty go into the details. But I just want to say that this effort reflects the guidance that I personally gave throughout this process. Yes, the tide of war is receding. But the question that this strategy answers is what kind of military will we need long after the wars of the last decade are over. And today, we're fortunate to be moving forward from a position of strength. As I made clear in Australia, we will be strengthening our presence in the Asia Pacific, and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical region. We're going to continue investing in our critical partnerships and alliances, including NATO, which has demonstrated time and again -- most recently in Libya -- that it's a force multiplier. We will stay vigilant, especially in the Middle East. As we look beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and the end of long-term nation-building with large military footprints -- we'll be able to ensure our security with smaller conventional ground forces. We'll continue to get rid of outdated Cold War-era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities that we need for the future, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, counterterrorism, countering weapons of mass destruction and the ability to operate in environments where adversaries try to deny us access. So, yes, our military will be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to maintain our military superiority with armed forces that are agile, flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats. We're also going to keep faith with those who serve, by making sure our troops have the equipment and capabilities they need to succeed, and by prioritizing efforts that focus on wounded warriors, mental health and the well-being of our military families. And as our newest veterans rejoin civilian life, we'll keep working to give our veterans the care, the benefits and job opportunities that they deserve and that they have earned. Finally, although today is about our defense strategy, I want to close with a word about the defense budget that will flow from this strategy. The details will be announced in the coming weeks. Some will no doubt say that the spending reductions are too big; others will say that they're too small. It will be easy to take issue with a particular change in a particular program. But I'd encourage all of us to remember what President Eisenhower once said -- that ""each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs."" After a decade of war, and as we rebuild the source of our strength -- at home and abroad -- it's time to restore that balance. I think it's important for all Americans to remember, over the past 10 years, since 9/11, our defense budget grew at an extraordinary pace. Over the next 10 years, the growth in the defense budget will slow, but the fact of the matter is this: It will still grow, because we have global responsibilities that demand our leadership. In fact, the defense budget will still be larger than it was toward the end of the Bush Administration. And I firmly believe, and I think the American people understand, that we can keep our military strong and our nation secure with a defense budget that continues to be larger than roughly the next 10 countries combined. So again, I want to thank Secretary Panetta, Chairman Dempsey, all the defense leaders who are on this stage, and some who are absent, for their leadership and their partnership throughout this process. Our men and women in uniform give their very best to America every single day, and in return they deserve the very best from America. And I thank all of you for the commitment to the goal that we all share: keeping America strong and secure in the 21st century, and keeping our Armed Forces the very best in the world. And with that, I will turn this discussion over to Leon and to Marty, who can explain more and take your questions. So thank you very much. I understand this is the first time a President has done this. It's a pretty nice room. Thank you guys.","President Barack Obama on Thursday proposed a historic shift in the U.S. military's size and ambitions, scaling back its ability to wage the type of war and occupation that just concluded in Iraq as the administration seeks to cut defense spending over the next decade.

Under the proposal, the Army would face a 14% reduction in troops -- leaving it with too few to conduct two grueling ground wars at once, long a strategic imperative of the Defense Department. The plan also indicates reductions in the nation's nuclear arsenal and a delay in the Pentagon's most expensive weapons, such as the F-35 stealth jet made by Lockheed Martin Corp.

Overall, the plan envisions shrinking military spending by $487 billion over 10 years, a cut of about 8% in coming years, according to Pentagon figures. While the president has wide latitude to set military priorities, specific cuts the Pentagon will announce in coming weeks must be approved by Congress.

President Obama said the nation was ""turning the page"" on a decade of war. But the president and Pentagon leaders said they weren't abandoning the U.S. role as the pre-eminent global power.

""Our military will be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to maintain our military superiority with armed forces that are agile, flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats,"" he said in a rare appearance by a president at the Pentagon.

Announcement of the strategy prompted a swift response from Republicans. Sen John McCain (R., Ariz.) said the U.S. couldn't afford a ""budget-driven defense strategy"" but said he would review the document released by the administration. ""I understand the need for reductions in defense spending, but we must also address the broader cultural problem plaguing our defense establishment: the waste, inefficiency, and ineffective programs,"" Sen. McCain said.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. David Barno of the Center for a New American Security, a centrist think tank that often is aligned with the administration, said the plan ""fails to address the elephant in the room: whether this strategy can hold up under the weight of further defense cuts,"" particularly additional cuts contained in the debt-ceiling agreement Congress reached last year.

But Charles Knight, co-director of the Project on Defense Alternatives, which advocates more aggressive defense-spending cuts, said the administration's plans were ""only baby steps"" toward greater fiscal restraint.

""The first strategic priority of the United States today is to get its economic house in order,"" he said. ""Doing this means spending less on the military in coming years.""

Criticism is likely to grow in coming weeks as details of the cuts emerge. Key Republican presidential candidates, including Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, have proposed increases in defense spending, and have criticized proposed Pentagon cutbacks in the past.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the military still will be able to respond to multiple crises at once, deterring aggression around the globe. ""Make no mistake, we will have the capability to confront and defeat more than one adversary at a time,"" he said.

But, he said, ""the Army and Marine Corps will no longer be sized to support the large-scale, long-term stability operations that dominated military priorities . . . over the past decade.""

Mr. Obama said he wouldn't repeat the mistakes of past administrations by crippling the military through postwar cuts. But some Pentagon officials -- anxious to stave off the possibility of further reductions -- said the proposed reductions will be as deep as those after Vietnam and the Cold War when cuts in annual emergency war spending are counted.

Details of the cuts will be announced in coming weeks as part of the Pentagon budget.

Defense officials said the Army, currently at 570,000, likely will shrink to about 490,000.

A strategy document released Thursday said the military will be redesigned to fight one war using air, land and sea forces, while still being able to take on involvements in another region.

Mr. Panetta and defense contractors have argued for months that the planned cuts, while tolerable, are quite steep. But they have contended that an additional $500 billion to $600 billion in cuts over the next 10 years triggered by last year's congressional deal on the country's debt ceiling would be ruinous for the military.

""The capability, readiness and agility of the force will not be sustained if Congress fails to do its duty and the military is forced to accept far deeper cuts,"" Mr. Panetta said Thursday. ""That would force us to shed missions and commitments and capabilities that we believe are necessary to protect core U.S. national security interests. And it would result in what we think would be a demoralized and hollow force.""

The strategy document reflects the Obama administration's preference for operations such as the war in Libya, which entailed a large coalition of nations and no U.S. ground forces. The strategy also touts the utility of U.S. special operations forces, which have decimated the leadership of al Qaeda.

Also emphasized in the new strategy are counterterrorism operations -- missions using special operations forces that create only a small overseas footprint and work with local forces.

Intelligence and surveillance will take on increasingly important roles, meaning the Air Force fleet of unmanned drones is likely to grow.

A new U.S. emphasis on Asia is reinforced by the strategy as the Pentagon plans to shift its focus and resources away from Europe. The Pentagon sees challenges in China's military modernization and is planning the new military approach to more aggressively counter Beijing's ""anti-access"" technologies, weapons such as China's DF-21D antiship ballistic missile, used for keeping U.S. ships at greater distances.

Mr. Obama approved a buildup of forces in Afghanistan, but administration officials have always viewed counterinsurgency operations with skepticism. The new strategy reflects the administration's view that counterinsurgency conflicts are too costly, while yielding murky results and incremental gains for international security.

Defense officials said they wouldn't abandon the military's expertise in conducting stability operations, but would move some of the resources to military reserves. That would preserve the ability of the Army to conduct limited counterinsurgency.","President Obama has for the first time put his own stamp on an all-encompassing American military policy by turning from the grinding ground wars that he inherited from the Bush administration and refocusing on what he described as a smaller, more agile force across Asia, the Pacific and the Middle East.

In an unusual appearance at the Pentagon briefing room on Thursday, Mr. Obama outlined a new national defense strategy driven by three realities: the winding down of a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, a fiscal crisis demanding hundreds of billions of dollars in Pentagon budget cuts and a rising threat from China and Iran.

A fourth reality, not mentioned in the briefing room, was Mr. Obama's re-election campaign and the chorus of Republican presidential candidates who have sought to portray him as decimating the Pentagon budget and being weak in his response to Iran.

Mr. Obama, who spoke surrounded by a tableau of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in dress uniforms and with chests full of medals, underscored the national security successes of his administration -- the ending of the Iraq war, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya -- before declaring that the United States would downsize to a smaller ground force, get rid of ""outdated cold war-era systems"" and step up investments in intelligence-gathering and cyberwarfare.

He also said, in what seemed aimed at the Republicans as well as the Defense Department officials in the room, that ""our military will be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to maintain our military superiority.""

Despite the pageantry, many elements of the new strategy had a ""back to the future"" quality and echoed the goals of a smaller but more technically proficient military advanced by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld before the Sept. 11 attacks. Those plans were soon overtaken by the need to build up ground forces for the kind of conventional wars that the Pentagon had not envisioned a decade ago.

""Conventionally it makes perfect sense to avoid fighting worst-case wars,"" said Anthony H. Cordesman, a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But the 20th century, and even the 21st century, is a warning about how well anybody can do long-term forecasting. I have listened for decades to, 'This time we're going to be more efficient, this time we're going to use technology.' ""

Pentagon officials acknowledged the risks in a strategy that declares that American ground forces will no longer be large enough to conduct prolonged, large-scale counterinsurgency campaigns like those in Iraq and Afghanistan -- Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has said the Army must shrink to 490,000 soldiers over the next decade, from 570,000 -- and so said they were prepared to change course if required.

In a briefing after Mr. Obama's remarks, Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the new strategy embraced ""reversibility"" that would allow the Pentagon to avoid ""departmental hubris."" In other words, the Defense Department would begin a slow build-down of the Army that could be reversed and, in a national security emergency, it could order up a massive mobilization of the National Guard and Reserves.

Other analysts said the strategy appeared good but that without the details -- specifically, what kind of budget cuts it would result in -- it was hard to judge. The specific cuts are to be made public in coming weeks.

""It's kind of an incomplete,"" said Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr., a military expert at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ""It's like when you jump out of an aircraft with a parachute, the first five seconds are 'so far, so good.' But you're still waiting for the chute to open.""

White House and Pentagon officials said that Mr. Obama spent a substantial amount of time with military officials on the new strategy, which they defined as six meetings he had on the strategy with military leaders and regional commanders between September and late December. Although other presidents have been deeply immersed in military policy, for Mr. Obama the time commitment appears to signal an interest in a policy that turns the page from President George W. Bush's wars.

""Certainly it indicates a level of interest on the president's part, over and above what we've seen from him before,"" Mr. Krepinevich said.

The new strategy document finally defines away the Defense Department's historic requirement to have the ability to fight and win two wars at once -- a measure that one official said ""has been on life-support for years.""

The strategy released under Mr. Obama in 2010 said the military was responsible for ""maintaining the ability to prevail against two capable nation-state aggressors.""

In contrast, the strategy released Thursday said the military must be able to fight one war, but is responsible only for ""denying the objectives of -- or imposing unacceptable costs on -- an opportunistic aggressor in a second region.""

Senior Pentagon officials said that viewing military requirements through something as static as the two-war model had become outdated, and that the true measurement was whether the Pentagon could field a force capable of carrying out a wide range of military actions to protect the nation's interests.

Pentagon officials made it clear that the department's priorities in coming years would be financing for defense and offense in cyberspace, for Special Operations forces and for the broad area of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.",2012-01-06,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.990, NEU: 0.008, NEG: 0.002})",0.9903096556663513,0.00805324874818325,0.0016370898811146617,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.756, POS: 0.216, NEG: 0.028})","AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.569, NEU: 0.421, NEG: 0.010})",0.2161000669002533,0.7562229037284851,0.027677038684487343,0.5685810446739197,0.4212203323841095,0.010198602452874184
39,39,2012-01-25-StateOfTheUnion.txt,"Thank you. Thank you. Please be seated. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans: Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq.Â Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives. We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world.Â For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country.Â Most of al Qaedaâs top lieutenants have been defeated.Â  The Talibanâs momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of Americaâs Armed Forces.Â At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations.Â Theyâre not consumed with personal ambition.Â  They donât obsess over their differences.Â They focus on the mission at hand.Â They work together.Â  Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example.Â Think about the America within our reach:Â a country that leads the world in educating its people; an America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs; a future where weâre in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity arenât so tied to unstable parts of the world; an economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded. We can do this. I know we can, because weâve done it before.Â At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known.Â My grandfather, a veteran of Pattonâs Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.Â The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.Â They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share -- the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.Â  The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive.Â No challenge is more urgent.Â No debate is more important.Â We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.Â Whatâs at stake arenât Democratic values or Republican values, but American values.Â And we have to reclaim them. Letâs remember how we got here.Â Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.Â Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete.Â Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that werenât, and personal debt that kept piling up. In 2008, the house of cards collapsed.Â We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldnât afford or understand them.Â Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other peopleâs money.Â Regulators had looked the other way, or didnât have the authority to stop the bad behavior. It was wrong.Â It was irresponsible.Â And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag.Â In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs.Â And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect. Those are the facts.Â But so are these:Â In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005.Â American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s.Â Together, weâve agreed to cut the deficit by more than 2 trillion dollars.Â And weâve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again. The state of our Union is getting stronger.Â And weâve come too far to turn back now.Â  As long as Iâm President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum.Â But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place. No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits.Â Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy thatâs built to last -- an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values. Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing. On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse.Â Some even said we should let it die.Â With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen.Â  In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility.Â We got workers and automakers to settle their differences.Â We got the industry to retool and restructure.Â Today, General Motors is back on top as the worldâs number-one automaker.Â Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company.Â Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories.Â And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.Â Â Â  We bet on American workers.Â We bet on American ingenuity.Â And tonight, the American auto industry is back. Whatâs happening in Detroit can happen in other industries.Â It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.Â We canât bring every job back thatâs left our shore.Â But right now, itâs getting more expensive to do business in places like China.Â  Meanwhile, America is more productive.Â A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home.Â Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lockâs unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity. So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back.Â But we have to seize it.Â Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple:Â Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. We should start with our tax code.Â Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas.Â Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world.Â It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.Â So letâs change it.Â  First, if youâre a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldnât get a tax deduction for doing it.Â That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home. Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas.Â From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax.Â And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America. Third, if youâre an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut.Â If youâre a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here.Â And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers. So my message is simple.Â It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America.Â  Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away. Weâre also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world.Â Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.Â With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, weâre on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule.Â And soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.Â Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.Â  I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products.Â And I will not stand by when our competitors donât play by the rules.Â Weâve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last Administration -- and itâs made a difference.Â Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.Â But we need to do more.Â Itâs not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated.Â Itâs not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because theyâre heavily subsidized. Tonight, Iâm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.Â There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.Â And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia.Â Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you -- America will always win. I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but canât find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that -- openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.Â Itâs inexcusable.Â And we know how to fix it.Â Â  Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic.Â Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.Â The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackieâs tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant. I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did.Â  Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job.Â My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help.Â Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and running.Â  Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers -- places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing. And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help that they need.Â  It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work. These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today.Â But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier. For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year, weâve convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the first time thatâs happened in a generation. But challenges remain.Â And we know how to solve them. At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers.Â We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over 250,000 dollars.Â A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.Â Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives.Â Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make a difference. Teachers matter.Â So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, letâs offer schools a deal.Â Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. And in return, grant schools flexibility:Â to teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just arenât helping kids learn.Â Thatâs a bargain worth making. We also know that when students donât walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma.Â When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better.Â So tonight, I am proposing that every state -- every state -- requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18. When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college.Â At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle-class families thousands of dollars, and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years. Of course, itâs not enough for us to increase student aid.Â We canât just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; weâll run out of money.Â States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets.Â And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents whoâve done just that.Â Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly.Â Some use better technology.Â The point is, itâs possible.Â So let me put colleges and universities on notice:Â If you canât stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down.Â Higher education canât be a luxury -- it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford. Letâs also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge:Â the fact that they arenât yet American citizens.Â  Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.Â Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else. That doesnât make sense. I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration.Â Thatâs why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before.Â Thatâs why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.Â The opponents of action are out of excuses.Â We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, letâs at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country.Â Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away. You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country.Â That means women should earn equal pay for equal work.Â It means we should support everyone whoâs willing to work, and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs. After all, innovation is what America has always been about.Â Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses.Â So letâs pass an agenda that helps them succeed.Â Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow.Â Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs.Â Both parties agree on these ideas.Â So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year. Innovation also demands basic research.Â  Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.Â  New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.Â  Donât gut these investments in our budget.Â  Donât let other countries win the race for the future.Â  Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries. And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.Â  Over the last three years, weâve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, Iâm directing my Administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.Â Right now -- right now -- American oil production is the highest that itâs been in eight years.Â  Thatâs right -- eight years.Â  Not only that -- last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years. But with only 2 percent of the worldâs oil reserves, oil isnât enough.Â  This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy.Â A strategy thatâs cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs. We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years.Â And my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.Â  Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade.Â  And Iâm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.Â Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk. The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we donât have to choose between our environment and our economy.Â And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock â- reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground. Now, whatâs true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy.Â  In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the worldâs leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries.Â  Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.Â  When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance.Â  But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan.Â  Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.Â  Today, itâs hiring workers like Bryan, who said, âIâm proud to be working in the industry of the future.â Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments donât always come right away.Â  Some technologies donât pan out; some companies fail.Â  But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.Â  I will not walk away from workers like Bryan.Â I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here.Â  Weâve subsidized oil companies for a century.Â  Thatâs long enough.Â Itâs time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising.Â  Pass clean energy tax credits.Â  Create these jobs. We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives.Â  The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.Â  But thereâs no reason why Congress shouldnât at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.Â  So far, you havenât acted.Â  Well, tonight, I will.Â  Iâm directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes.Â  And Iâm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the worldâs largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history -- with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year. Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy.Â  So hereâs a proposal:Â Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.Â  Their energy bills will be 100 billion dollars lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them.Â  Send me a bill that creates these jobs. Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair Americaâs infrastructure.Â  So much of America needs to be rebuilt.Â  Weâve got crumbling roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.Â  During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge.Â  After World War II, we connected our states with a system of highways.Â  Democratic and Republican Administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today. In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects.Â  But you need to fund these projects.Â  Take the money weâre no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home. Thereâs never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst.Â  Of course, construction workers werenât the only ones who were hurt.Â  So were millions of innocent Americans whoâve seen their home values decline.Â  And while government canât fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldnât have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.Â Â  And thatâs why Iâm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about 3,000 dollars a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.Â No more red tape.Â  No more runaround from the banks.Â  A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it wonât add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust. Letâs never forget:Â Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same.Â Itâs time to apply the same rules from top to bottom.Â No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts.Â An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.Â  Weâve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldnât afford them, and buyers who knew they couldnât afford them.Â  Thatâs why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior.Â Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices -- these donât destroy the free market.Â  They make the free market work better. Thereâs no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly.Â  In fact, Iâve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his.Â Iâve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that donât make sense.Â  Weâve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than 10 billion dollars over the next five years.Â  We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend 10,000 dollars a year proving that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.Â  With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk. Now, Iâm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder.Â Absolutely.Â  But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago.Â  I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean.Â  I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men. And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules.Â  The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial systemâs core purpose:Â  Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, or start a business, or send their kids to college. So if you are a big bank or financial institution, youâre no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customersâ deposits.Â  Youâre required to write out a âliving willâ that details exactly how youâll pay the bills if you fail -- because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again.Â  And if youâre a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they canât afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.Â  Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job:Â to look out for them. Weâll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect peopleâs investments.Â  Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because thereâs no real penalty for being a repeat offender.Â  Thatâs bad for consumers, and itâs bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing.Â  So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.Â  And tonight, Iâm asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis.Â  This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.Â  Now, a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy.Â  But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future. Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile.Â People cannot afford losing 40 dollars out of each paycheck this year.Â  There are plenty of ways to get this done.Â  So letâs agree right here, right now:Â  No side issues.Â  No drama.Â  Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.Â  Letâs get it done. When it comes to the deficit, weâve already agreed to more than 2 trillion dollars in cuts and savings.Â But we need to do more, and that means making choices.Â  Right now, weâre poised to spend nearly 1 trillion dollars more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.Â  Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households.Â  Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.Â Â  Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans?Â  Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else -- like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans?Â  Because if weâre serious about paying down our debt, we canât do both.Â Â  The American people know what the right choice is.Â  So do I.Â  As I told the Speaker this summer, Iâm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.Â  But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett Rule.Â If you make more than 1 million dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.Â And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right:Â Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.Â In fact, if youâre earning a million dollars a year, you shouldnât get special tax subsidies or deductions.Â On the other hand, if you make under 250,000 dollars a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldnât go up.Â Youâre the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages.Â Youâre the ones who need relief.Â Â Â  Now, you can call this class warfare all you want.Â But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes?Â Most Americans would call that common sense.Â  We donât begrudge financial success in this country.Â  We admire it.Â  When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, itâs not because they envy the rich.Â  Itâs because they understand that when I get a tax break I donât need and the country canât afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference -- like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet.Â  Thatâs not right.Â  Americans know thatâs not right.Â  They know that this generationâs success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility.Â  Thatâs how weâll reduce our deficit.Â  Thatâs an America built to last. Now, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health care.Â  But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now:Â  Nothing will get done in Washington this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken. Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?Â  The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didnât come from events beyond our control.Â  It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not.Â  Who benefited from that fiasco? Iâve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.Â  But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad -- and it seems to get worse every year. Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics.Â  So together, letâs take some steps to fix that.Â  Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress; I will sign it tomorrow.Â  Letâs limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact.Â  Letâs make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress canât lobby Congress, and vice versa -- an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.Â  Some of whatâs broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days.Â  A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything -- even routine business -- passed through the Senate.Â  Neither party has been blameless in these tactics.Â  Now both parties should put an end to it.Â For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days. The executive branch also needs to change.Â  Too often, itâs inefficient, outdated and remote.Â Thatâs why Iâve asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that our government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people. Finally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town.Â  We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common-sense ideas.Â  Iâm a Democrat.Â  But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed:Â  That government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.Â Thatâs why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and states.Â  Thatâs why weâre getting rid of regulations that donât work.Â  Thatâs why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a government program.Â  On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.Â  The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective government.Â  And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress.Â  With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow.Â  But I can do a whole lot more with your help.Â  Because when we act together, thereâs nothing the United States of America canât achieve.Â  Thatâs the lesson weâve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years. Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.Â  From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they canât escape the reach of the United States of America. From this position of strength, weâve begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan.Â  Ten thousand of our troops have come home.Â  Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer.Â  This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America. As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sanaâa to Tripoli.Â  A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the worldâs longest-serving dictators -- a murderer with American blood on his hands.Â  Today, he is gone.Â  And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be denied. How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain.Â  But we have a huge stake in the outcome.Â  And while itâs ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well.Â  We will stand against violence and intimidation.Â  We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings -- men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.Â  We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty. And we will safeguard Americaâs own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests.Â  Look at Iran.Â  Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iranâs nuclear program now stands as one.Â  The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt:Â  America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations. The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe.Â  Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever.Â  Our ties to the Americas are deeper.Â  Our ironclad commitment -- and I mean ironclad -- to Israelâs security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. Weâve made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope.Â  From the coalitions weâve built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions weâve led against hunger and disease; from the blows weâve dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back.Â  Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesnât know what theyâre talking about. Thatâs not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us.Â  Thatâs not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are higher than theyâve been in years.Â  Yes, the world is changing.Â  No, we canât control every event.Â  But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs -- and as long as Iâm President, I intend to keep it that way. Thatâs why, working with our military leaders, Iâve proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget.Â  To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, Iâve already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats. Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it.Â As they come home, we must serve them as well as theyâve served us.Â  That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned -- which is why weâve increased annual VA spending every year Iâve been President.Â  And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation. With the bipartisan support of this Congress, weâre providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets.Â  Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families.Â  And tonight, Iâm proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her. Which brings me back to where I began.Â  Those of us whoâve been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops.Â  When you put on that uniform, it doesnât matter if youâre black or white; Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight.Â  When youâre marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails.Â  When youâre in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind. One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden.Â  On it are each of their names.Â  Some may be Democrats.Â  Some may be Republicans.Â  But that doesnât matter.Â  Just like it didnât matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a man who was George Bushâs defense secretary -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman who ran against me for President.Â  All that mattered that day was the mission.Â  No one thought about politics.Â  No one thought about themselves.Â  One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didnât deserve credit for the mission.Â  It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs.Â  More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other -- because you canât charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that thereâs somebody behind you, watching your back. So it is with America.Â  Each time I look at that flag, Iâm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes.Â  No one built this country on their own.Â  This nation is great because we built it together.Â  This nation is great because we worked as a team.Â  This nation is great because we get each otherâs backs.Â  And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.Â  As long as we are joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama offered Americans a populist economic vision in his State of the Union address Tuesday, seeking to draw a contrast with his eventual Republican rival and demonstrating the widening policy gulf between the two political parties.

Mr. Obama's laundry-list of initiatives -- steep tax increases on wealthier Americans, fresh investigations into the mortgage crisis and support for domestic manufacturing -- was aimed at buttressing a re-election message that posits him as defender of Americans beset by inequality in the tax code and broader economy.

""It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts and no copouts,"" Mr. Obama said. ""An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.""

The themes he trumpeted before a joint session of Congress are ones Americans will hear throughout the year as the president works to convince voters he deserves a second term. He also called for a new potential fix for underwater homeowners and legislation intended to discourage companies from shipping jobs overseas.

He offered few details on his initiatives, even as he tried to rally the nation. Using rhetoric that was softer than he employed in a recent fiery speech in Kansas, Mr. Obama's speech featured appeals to ""fair play"" rather than attacks on ""breathtaking greed."" And some of his ideas, such as boosting domestic energy production and revamping government, were designed to appeal to Republicans.

But for the most part, his policies were starkly at odds with Republican orthodoxy. Besides a year-end extension of a temporary payroll tax cut, most of Mr. Obama's ideas will have a slim chance of passing. Others he can enact unilaterally, such as the creation of a government task force designed to crack down on China by enforcing trade laws.

If there was any doubt Mr. Obama's address was intended as a campaign speech, he made a point of including policies that appeal to many possible constituencies: Hispanics, women, anti-Wall Street groups, labor and environmentalists. Two hours before delivering the speech, he sent an email to his campaign supporters saying, ""Tonight, we set the tone for the year ahead.""

Republicans accused him of playing class warfare and said their goal is to free the economy from the shackles imposed by his administration. They criticized Mr. Obama's speech as an election-year blueprint.

Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said in the formal GOP response that Mr. Obama doesn't deserve to be re-elected because even though he didn't cause the economy's problems, ""he was elected on a promise to fix them, and he cannot claim that the last three years have made things anything but worse.""

""We do not accept that ours will ever be a nation of haves and have nots; we must always be a nation of haves and soon to haves,"" Mr. Daniels said.

Lawmakers' reactions in the chamber appeared less antagonistic than in recent addresses. That was in part because Mr. Obama paid tribute to some bipartisan ideas, but also because Republicans seemed determined not to be baited into discourtesy. They clapped politely and occasionally cheered, as when Mr. Obama touted an ""all of the above"" energy policy.

Instead, the differences between the two parties were subtler, though no less stark. In an unusually political gesture for such a speech, Mr. Obama invited billionaire Warren Buffett's personal assistant, Debbie Bosanek, to sit with first lady Michelle Obama in the House visitor gallery to underscore his tax proposal that sparked a bitter fight between him and congressional Republicans last year.

Mr. Buffett made a national figure out of Ms. Bosanek after noting her effective tax rate is higher than his, largely because of his relatively low tax rate for capital gains compared with her regular salaried income. Mr. Obama then proposed the so-called ""Buffett Rule,"" which would require a minimum tax rate for Americans making more than $1 million a year.

Republicans countered the invitation by having House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) host executives involved in the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Mr. Obama recently delayed over Republican objections.

The president fleshed out his ""Buffett rule"" Tuesday night, proposing that households earning more than $1 million a year face a minimum 30% federal income tax, with no deductions allowed for mortgage interest, health care, retirement savings or child-care benefits. Charitable contributions and state and local governments would still qualify for tax breaks. Few Americans pay an effective tax rate that high.The proposal harks back to the original Alternative Minimum Tax, which was crafted in 1969 to crack down on the use of deductions and other tax benefits employed by just 155 households.

The White House's goal as Mr. Obama faces a tough re-election fight is to tap widespread anti-Wall Street sentiment and voter anger about economic disparity without scaring independents.

With the economy still struggling and the unemployment rate at 8.5%, the president's re-election campaign is aiming to define the 2012 election as a choice between two visions, rather than a referendum on Mr. Obama, which Republicans would prefer.

Mr. Obama's aggressive approach to the wealthy and Wall Street carries some risk. Fewer than half of Americans believe it is extremely or very important for the federal government to reduce the income and wealth gap between the rich and poor, according to a Gallup poll last month. And while a majority of those are Democrats, just 43% of independents agree.

Mr. Obama tried to persuade Americans the economy is improving, citing 22 months of job growth. ""The state of our union is getting stronger,"" he said.

To buttress his overall message, in addition to his call for higher taxes, Mr. Obama called on Congress to pass legislation to toughen antifraud laws governing the financial industry.

The president also said he would direct the Justice Department to launch a special unit of state attorneys general and federal prosecutors to investigate the packaging of risky mortgages into securities that were bundled and sold by Wall Street.

Mr. Obama asked Congress to provide funding to people who have kept up their mortgage payments so that they can refinance at lower interest rates, funded by fees levied on banks.

The president advanced several ideas aimed at discouraging companies from shipping jobs overseas, all of which need congressional approval. Most notable: he would require that all companies pay a minimum tax on overseas profits, an effort to offset any advantage for companies who want to set up operations in lower-tax countries.

He also proposes to bar companies from deducting as a business expense costs associated with shutting U.S. operations to move them abroad. And he would create a new tax credit to cover moving expenses for companies that bring jobs back to the U.S.

Administration officials said the president would next month propose a fuller framework for a revamp of the unwieldy corporate-tax code, including the ideas put forth Tuesday.

Mr. Obama peppered his speech with some more centrist initiatives, including weighing in squarely in favor of natural gas use, a position that could irritate environmentalists, as well as a hefty emphasis on education.

Aiming to control college costs, Mr. Obama said he would cut federal funding to colleges that raise tuition too high.

A year ago, Mr. Obama opened with a call for unity in the wake of the Tucson, Ariz., shooting that gravely wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D., Ariz.).

This year, he made a similar plea -- and on his way into the House chamber, he warmly greeted Ms. Giffords, who is resigning this week to continue her recovery.

Mr. Obama opened and closed his address with a reminder of his most popular achievement, finding and killing Osama bin Laden. He said the troops who carried it out should serve as a model for the political system.

""When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind,"" he said.

Mr. Obama will continue to amplify his economic message by spelling out their details during a three-day trip through five battleground states he begins Wednesday.","President Obama pledged on Tuesday night to use government power to balance the scale between America's rich and the rest of the public, trying to present an election-year choice between continued leadership toward an economy ""built to last"" and what he called irresponsible policies of the past that caused an economic collapse.

Declaring that ""we've come too far to turn back now,"" the president used his final State of the Union address before he faces the voters to showcase the extent to which he will try to contrast his core economic principles with those of his Republican rivals in a time of deep economic uncertainty. While many Americans remain disappointed with the state of the economy and the president's handling of it, Mr. Obama nonetheless tried to bring into relief the difference between where the country was when he took over and where it is now.

""The state of our union is getting stronger,"" he declared in time-honored tradition. ""In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs."" He pointed to renewed hiring by American manufacturers and -- borrowing the ""built to last"" phrase from the auto industry he helped save -- he sketched out, albeit vaguely, what he called a blueprint for economic growth in which the wealthy play by the same rules as ordinary Americans.

Republicans challenged Mr. Obama's assessment of the economy, and asserted that his policies had made the situation worse. But with their own poll numbers diving, Congressional Republicans were subdued in their response to the speech, careful not to boo or seem disrespectful. And the president disputed their claim that he was practicing the politics of division.

""You can call this class warfare all you want,"" Mr. Obama said of his call to create a more even economic playing field. ""Most Americans would call that common sense."" He characterized the choice as one between whether ""a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by"" or his own vision -- ""where everyone gets a fair shot.""

In returning to his 2008 campaign motif of these being ""not Democratic values or Republican values, but American values,"" Mr. Obama presented a somewhat modest list of initiatives he could enact through executive authority coupled with more ambitious proposals unlikely to advance in Congress. It was an address meant to show a president still interested in governing and a leader putting the interests of the American middle class at the top of his agenda.

Many of his proposals centered on changes to the tax code, including limiting deductions for companies that move jobs overseas, rewarding companies that return jobs to the United States and increasing taxes on wealthy Americans.

Taking aim at financial institutions that engaged in risky lending practices that many believe tipped the country into financial crisis, Mr. Obama said he was asking Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and state attorneys general to expand investigations into abusive lending. The new unit, he said, ""will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.""

Mr. Obama also proposed a new trade enforcement unit that would add to the number of government investigators pursuing unfair trade practices and that would be responsible for filing lawsuits against foreign countries, namely China. He called for new legislation to make it easier for Americans to refinance their homes if their interest rates are above market rates. And he proposed a bound-to-be-contentious way to allocate any savings from ending the war in Iraq and winding down the war in Afghanistan: by using half of the war savings on infrastructure projects and the other half to reduce the deficit.

""We will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt and phony financial profits,"" Mr. Obama said. Though his advisers have vowed a campaign against Congress, he expressed a willingness to ""work with anyone in this chamber"" and said he would ""oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.""

In an emotional moment, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was wounded in the Tucson shooting last year, returned for the speech before her imminent resignation from the House to concentrate on her recovery. Although the president is often criticized for his aloofness, he embraced Ms. Giffords for a long 10 seconds, rocking and almost seeming to be dancing with her.

Mr. Obama again proposed changes to the tax code so the wealthy pay more, a position he has indicated he will continue to press in this election year against Republican opposition. He called for Congress to put into place his ""Buffett Rule"" -- named after the Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren E. Buffett -- whereby people making more than $1 million a year would pay a minimum effective tax rate of at least 30 percent in income taxes.

To illustrate his point, he provocatively used Mr. Buffett's secretary, Debbie Bosanek, as one of his props, seating Ms. Bosanek -- whose effective tax rate is higher than Mr. Buffett's, he has said -- in the chamber with the first lady, Michelle Obama.

Mr. Obama's income tax proposal on Tuesday night was particularly charged, coming as it did less than 24 hours after Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential candidate, released tax returns showing that he and his wife, Ann, had an effective federal income tax rate in 2010 of 13.9 percent and an income ranking among the top one-10th of 1 percent of all taxpayers in 2010.

Mr. Obama would like the new tax to replace the alternative minimum tax, which was created decades ago to make sure that the richest taxpayers with plentiful deductions and credits did not avoid income taxes, but which now affects millions of Americans who are considered upper middle class.

An upbeat Mr. Obama delivered his remarks standing in the chamber of the House of Representatives, an arena ruled by his political adversaries, given the Republican majority that the president and fellow Democrats have criticized as blocking much of the White House agenda.

But in the official Republican response to the address, Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana said it had been Congressional Republicans who had acted to improve the economy, only to be thwarted by the president.

""The president did not cause the economic and fiscal crisis that continue in America tonight,"" Mr. Daniels said. ""But he was elected on a promise to fix them, and he cannot claim that the last three years have made things anything but worse.""

While he was addressing Congress and assembled dignitaries, Mr. Obama was trying to reach the far greater national television audience of American voters, and his speech, while deep in policy initiatives, served in many ways as a prime-time kickoff of his re-election campaign.

In fact, most of the first lady's guests on Tuesday night came from states that figure heavily in Mr. Obama's re-election plans. Included were North Carolina, from where Mr. Obama selected both a worker and an employer, to demonstrate the benefits of public-private partnerships, and Florida, from where he chose a homeowner who was able to keep her house thanks to Mr. Obama's housing refinance program.

Mr. Obama said a major part of his agenda would be the expansion of domestic energy supplies, both from traditional fuels like oil and natural gas and from cleaner sources like wind and the sun. He singled out the rapid growth of domestic natural gas production through the technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which the government says has unlocked a 100-year supply that now makes the United States the Saudi Arabia of natural gas.

Reflecting the heavy emphasis on the economy in an election year, the president's speech was relatively short on national security, where most political observers and indeed his own aides believe his performance has been much stronger than on the economy. In fact, Mr. Obama ended his speech with the American assault last year that finally, after 10 years, killed Osama bin Laden, and talked of that fateful day last May when he monitored the attack from the White House.

He called on the country to emulate the unity of the Navy Seal team that conducted the raid. ""When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you,"" the president said, ""or the mission fails.""",2012-01-25,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.984, NEU: 0.014, NEG: 0.002})",0.9839233756065369,0.014360145665705204,0.0017164190066978335,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.587, POS: 0.396, NEG: 0.017})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.823, POS: 0.158, NEG: 0.019})",0.3963046371936798,0.5869424343109131,0.01675298623740673,0.15780144929885864,0.8231273889541626,0.019071126356720924
40,40,2012-03-27-HankukUniversity.txt,"Thank you. Please, thank you very much. Thank you very much.Â Â To President Park, faculty, staff and students, thank you so much for this very warm welcome.Â  It is a great honor to be here at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.Â  I want to thank Dr. Park for, a few moments ago, making me an honorary alumni of the university.Â  Â I know that this school has one of the worldâs finest foreign language programs -- which means that your English is much better than my Korean.Â  All I can say is, kamsa hamnida.Â  Â Â Now, this is my third visit to the Republic of Korea as President.Â  I've now been to Seoul more times than any other capital -- except for Washington, D.C.,Â  of course.Â  This reflects the extraordinary bonds between our two countries and our commitment to each other.Â  Iâm pleased that weâre joined by so many leaders here today, Koreans and Americans, who help keep us free and strong and prosperous every day.Â  That includes our first Korean-American ambassador to the Republic of Korea -- Ambassador Sung Kim.Â  Â Â Â Â Iâve seen the deep connections between our peoples in my own life -- among friends, colleagues.Â  Iâve seen it so many patriotic Korean Americans, including a man born in this city of Seoul, who came to America and has dedicated his life to lifting up the poor and sick of the world.Â  And last week I was proud to nominate him to lead the World Bank -- Dr. Jim Yong Kim.Â  Â Â Â Iâve also seen the bonds in our men and women in uniform, like the American and Korean troops I visited yesterday along the DMZ -- Freedomâs Frontier.Â  And we salute their service and are very grateful for them.Â  We honor all those who have given their lives in our defense, including the 46 brave souls who perished aboard the Cheonan two years ago today.Â  And in their memory we reaffirm the enduring promise at the core of our alliance -- we stand together, and the commitment of the United States to the defense and the security of the Republic of Korea will never waver.Â  Â Most of all, I see the strength of our alliance in all of you.Â  For decades, this school has produced leaders -- public servants, diplomats, businesspeople -- whoâve helped propel the modern miracle that is Korea-- transforming it from crushing poverty to one of the worldâs most dynamic economies; from authoritarianism to a thriving democracy; from a country focused inward to a leader for security and prosperity not only in this region but also around the world -- a truly âGlobal Korea.âÂ Â So to all the students here today, this is the Korea your generation will inherit.Â  And I believe there's no limits to what our two nations can achieve together.Â  For like your parents and grandparents before you, you know that the future is what we make of it.Â  And you know that in our digital age, we can connect and innovate across borders like never before -- with your smart phones and Twitter and Me2Day and Kakao Talk.Â  Itâs no wonder so many people around the world have caught the Korean Wave, Hallyu.Â  Â Or consider this:Â  In advance of my visit, our embassy invited Koreans to send us your questions using social media.Â  Some of you may have sent questions.Â  And they called it, ""Ask President Obama.""Â  Now, one of you -- maybe it was you, maybe it was somebody else -- this is true -- asked this question:Â  âHave you posted, yourself, a supportive opinion on a website under a disguised name, pretending you are one of the supporters of President Obama?âÂ  I hadnât thought of this.Â  But the truth is I have not done this.Â  Maybe my daughters have.Â  But I havenât done that myself.Â So our shared future -- and the unprecedented opportunity to meet shared challenges together -- is what brings me to Seoul.Â  Over the next two days, under President Leeâs leadership, weâll move ahead with the urgent work of preventing nuclear terrorism by securing the worldâs nuclear materials.Â  This is an important part of the broader, comprehensive agenda that I want to talk with you about today -- our vision of a world without nuclear weapons.Â Three years ago, I traveled to Prague and I declared Americaâs commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and to seeking a world without them.Â  I said I knew that this goal would not be reached quickly, perhaps not in my lifetime, but I knew we had to begin, with concrete steps.Â  And in your generation, I see the spirit we need in this endeavor -- an optimism that beats in the hearts of so many young people around the world.Â  Itâs that refusal to accept the world as it is, the imagination to see the world as it ought to be, and the courage to turn that vision into reality.Â  So today, with you, I want to take stock of our journey and chart our next steps.Â Here in Seoul, more than 50 nations will mark our progress toward the goal we set at the summit I hosted two years ago in Washington -- securing the worldâs vulnerable nuclear materials in four years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.Â  And since then, nations -- including the United States -- have boosted security at nuclear facilities.Â Â South Korea, Japan, Pakistan and others are building new centers to improve nuclear security and training.Â  Nations like Kazakhstan have moved nuclear materials to more secure locations.Â  Mexico, and just yesterday Ukraine, have joined the ranks of nations that have removed all the highly enriched uranium from their territory.Â  All told, thousands of pounds of nuclear material have been removed from vulnerable sites around the world.Â  This was deadly material that is now secure and can now never be used against a city like Seoul.Â Weâre also using every tool at our disposal to break up black markets and nuclear material.Â  Countries like Georgia and Moldova have seized highly enriched uranium from smugglers.Â  And countries like Jordan are building their own counter-smuggling teams, and weâre tying them together in a global network of intelligence and law enforcement.Â  Nearly 20 nations have now ratified the treaties and international partnerships that are at the center of our efforts.Â  And I should add that with the death of Osama bin Laden and the major blows that weâve struck against al Qaeda, a terrorist organization that has actively sought nuclear weapons is now on the path to defeat.Â Â Â Â Â Â So in short, the international community has made it harder than ever for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons, and that has made us all safer.Â  Weâre building an international architecture that can ensure nuclear safety.Â  But weâre under no illusions.Â  We know that nuclear material, enough for many weapons, is still being stored without adequate protection.Â  And we know that terrorists and criminal gangs are still trying to get their hands on it -- as well as radioactive material for a dirty bomb.Â  We know that just the smallest amount of plutonium -- about the size of an apple -- could kill hundreds of thousands and spark a global crisis.Â  The danger of nuclear terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to global security.Â And that's why here in Seoul, we need to keep at it.Â  And I believe we will.Â  Weâre expecting dozens of nations to announce over the next several days that theyâve fulfilled the promises they made two years ago.Â  And weâre now expecting more commitments -- tangible, concrete action -- to secure nuclear materials and, in some cases, remove them completely.Â  This is the serious, sustained global effort that we need, and it's an example of more nations bearing the responsibility and the costs of meeting global challenges.Â  This is how the international community should work in the 21st century.Â  And Korea is one of the key leaders in this process.Â The United States will continue to do our part -- securing our own material and helping others protect theirs.Â  Weâre moving forward with Russia to eliminate enough plutonium for about 17,000 nuclear weapons and turn it instead into electricity.Â  I can announce today a new agreement by the United States and several European partners toward sustaining the supply of medical isotopes that are used to treat cancer and heart disease without the use of highly enriched uranium.Â  And we will work with industry and hospitals and research centers in the United States and around the world, to recover thousands of unneeded radiological materials so that they can never do us harm.Â Â Now, American leadership has been essential to progress in a second area -- taking concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons.Â  As a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, this is our obligation, and itâs one that I take very seriously.Â  But I believe the United States has a unique responsibility to act -- indeed, we have a moral obligation.Â  I say this as President of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons.Â  I say it as a Commander-in-Chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side.Â  Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my two young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love canât be instantly wiped out.Â Over the past three years, weâve made important progress.Â  With Russia, weâre now reducing our arsenal under the New START Treaty -- the most comprehensive arms control agreement in nearly 20 years.Â  And when weâre done, we will have cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s.Â As President, I changed our nuclear posture to reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy.Â  I made it clear that the United States will not develop new nuclear warheads.Â  And we will not pursue new military missions for nuclear weapons.Â  Weâve narrowed the range of contingencies under which we would ever use or threaten to use nuclear weapons.Â  At the same time, Iâve made it clear that so long as nuclear weapons exist, weâll work with our Congress to maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal that guarantees the defense not only of the United States but also our allies -- including South Korea and Japan.Â My administrationâs nuclear posture recognizes that the massive nuclear arsenal we inherited from the Cold War is poorly suited to todayâs threats, including nuclear terrorism.Â  So last summer, I directed my national security team to conduct a comprehensive study of our nuclear forces.Â  That study is still underway.Â  But even as we have more work to do, we can already say with confidence that we have more nuclear weapons than we need.Â  Even after New START, the United States will still have more than 1,500 deployed nuclear weapons, and some 5,000 warheads.Â Â I firmly believe that we can ensure the security of the United States and our allies, maintain a strong deterrent against any threat, and still pursue further reductions in our nuclear arsenal.Â Going forward, weâll continue to seek discussions with Russia on a step we have never taken before -- reducing not only our strategic nuclear warheads, but also tactical weapons and warheads in reserve.Â  I look forward to discussing this agenda with President Putin when we will meet in May.Â  Missile defense will be on the agenda, but I believe this should be an area of cooperation, not tension.Â  And Iâm confident that, working together, we can continue to make progress and reduce our nuclear stockpiles.Â  Of course, weâll consult closely with our allies every step of the way, because the security and defense of our allies, both in Europe and Asia, is not negotiable.Â Â Â Â Here in Asia, we've urged China -- with its growing nuclear arsenal -- to join us in a dialogue on nuclear issues.Â  That offer remains open.Â  And more broadly, my administration will continue to pursue ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.Â  And after years of delay, itâs time to find a path forward on a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons -- ends it once and for all.Â By working to meet our responsibilities as a nuclear power, weâve made progress in a third area -- strengthening the global regime that prevents the spread of nuclear weapons.Â  When I came into office, the cornerstone of the worldâs effort -- which is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -- was fraying.Â  Iran had started spinning thousands of centrifuges.Â  North Korea conducted another nuclear test.Â  And the international community was largely divided on how to respond.Â Over the past three years, we have begun to reverse that dynamic.Â  Working with others, weâve enhanced the global partnership that prevent proliferation.Â  The International Atomic Energy Agency is now conducting the strongest inspections ever.Â  And weâve upheld the basic bargain of the NPT:Â  Countries with nuclear weapons, like the United States and Russia, will move towards disarmament; countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them; and all countries can have access to peaceful nuclear energy.Â Â Because of these efforts, the international community is more united and nations that attempt to flout their obligations are more isolated.Â  Of course, that includes North Korea.Â Â Here in Korea, I want to speak directly to the leaders in Pyongyang.Â  The United States has no hostile intent toward your country.Â  We are committed to peace.Â  And we are prepared to take steps to improve relations, which is why we have offered nutritional aid to North Korean mothers and children.Â Â But by now it should be clear, your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek; they have undermined it.Â  Instead of the dignity you desire, you're more isolated.Â  Instead of earning the respect of the world, you've been met with strong sanctions and condemnation.Â  You can continue down the road you are on, but we know where that leads.Â  It leads to more of the same -- more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.Â Â And know this:Â  There will be no rewards for provocations.Â  Those days are over.Â  To the leaders of Pyongyang I say, this is the choice before you.Â  This is the decision that you must make.Â  Today we say, Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace and give a better life to the people of North Korea.Â  Â This same principle applies with respect to Iran.Â  Under the NPT, Iran has the right to peaceful nuclear energy.Â  In fact, time and again the international community -- including the United States -- has offered to help Iran develop nuclear energy peacefully.Â  But time and again Iran has refused, instead taking the path of denial, deceit and deception.Â  And that is why Iran also stands alone, as the only member of the NPT unable to convince the international community that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes -- the only member.Â  Thatâs why the world has imposed unprecedented sanctions, slowing Iranâs nuclear program.Â Â The international community is now poised to enter talks with Iranâs leaders.Â  Once again, there is the possibility of a diplomatic resolution that gives Iran access to peaceful nuclear energy while addressing the concerns of the international community.Â  Today, Iâll meet with the leaders of Russia and China as we work to achieve a resolution in which Iran fulfills its obligations.Â Â There is time to solve this diplomatically.Â  It is always my preference to solve these issues diplomatically.Â  But time is short.Â  Iranâs leaders must understand they, too, face a choice. Iran must act with the seriousness and sense of urgencyÂ  that this moment demands.Â  Iran must meet its obligations.Â Â For the global response to Iran and North Koreaâs intransigence, a new international norm is emerging:Â  Treaties are binding; rules will be enforced; and violations will have consequences.Â  We refuse to consign ourselves to a future where more and more regimes possess the worldâs most deadly weapons.Â And this brings me to the final area where weâve made progress -- a renewed commitment to harnessing the power of the atom not for war, but for peaceful purposes.Â  After the tragedy at Fukushima, it was right and appropriate that nations moved to improve the safety and security of nuclear facilities.Â  Weâre doing so in the United States.Â  Itâs taking place all across the world.Â As we do, letâs never forget the astonishing benefits that nuclear technology has brought to our lives.Â  Nuclear technology helps make our food safe.Â  It prevents disease in the developing world.Â  Itâs the high-tech medicine that treats cancer and finds new cures.Â  And, of course, itâs the energy -- the clean energy that helps cut the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change.Â  Here in South Korea, as you know, as a leader in nuclear energy, youâve shown the progress and prosperity that can be achieved when nations embrace peaceful nuclear energy and reject the development of nuclear arms.Â And with rising oil prices and a warming climate, nuclear energy will only become more important.Â  Thatâs why, in the United States, weâve restarted our nuclear industry as part of a comprehensive strategy to develop every energy source.Â  We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades.Â  Weâre investing in innovative technologies so we can build the next generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants.Â  And weâre training the next generation of scientists and engineers who are going to unlock new technologies to carry us forward.Â One of the great challenges theyâll face and that your generation will face is the fuel cycle itself in producing nuclear energy.Â  We all know the problem:Â  The very process that gives us nuclear energy can also put nations and terrorists within the reach of nuclear weapons.Â  We simply canât go on accumulating huge amounts of the very material, like separated plutonium, that weâre trying to keep away from terrorists.Â Â And thatâs why weâre creating new fuel banks, to help countries realize the energy they seek without increasing the nuclear dangers that we fear.Â  Thatâs why Iâve called for a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation.Â  We need an international commitment to unlocking the fuel cycle of the future.Â  In the United States weâre investing in the research and development of new fuel cycles so that dangerous materials canât be stolen or diverted.Â  And today I urge nations to join us in seeking a future where we harness the awesome power of the atom to build and not to destroy.Â In this sense, we see how the efforts Iâve described today reinforce each other.Â  When we enhance nuclear security, weâre in a stronger position to harness safe, clean nuclear energy.Â  When we develop new, safer approaches to nuclear energy, we reduce the risk of nuclear terrorism and proliferation.Â  When nations, including my own, fulfill our responsibilities, it strengthens our ability to ensure that other nations fulfill their responsibilities.Â  And step by step, we come closer to the security and peace of a world without nuclear weapons.Â I know that there are those who deride our vision.Â  There are those who say ours is an impossible goal that will be forever out of reach.Â  But to anyone who doubts the great progress that is possible, I tell them, come to Korea.Â  Come to this country, which rose from the ashes of war -- a country that rose from the ashes of war, turning rubble into gleaming cities.Â  Stand where I stood yesterday, along a border that is the worldâs clearest contrast between a country committed to progress, a country committed to its people, and a country that leaves its own citizens to starve.Â Â Come to this great university, where a new generation is taking its place in the world -- helping to create opportunities that your parents and grandparents could only imagine.Â  Come and see some of the courageous individuals who join us today -- men and women, young and old, born in the North, but who left all they knew behind and risked their lives to find freedom and opportunity here in the South.Â  In your life stories we see the truth -- Koreans are one people.Â  And if just given the chance, if given their freedom, Koreans in the North are capable of great progress as well.Â  Â Looking out across the DMZ yesterday, but also looking into your eyes today, Iâm reminded of another countryâs experience that speaks to the change that is possible in our world.Â  After a terrible war, a proud people was divided.Â  Across a fortified border, armies massed, ready for war.Â  For decades, it was hard to imagine a different future.Â  But the forces of history and hopes of man could not be denied.Â  And today, the people of Germany are whole again -- united and free.Â Â Â No two places follow the same path, but this much is true:Â  The currents of history cannot be held back forever.Â  The deep longing for freedom and dignity will not go away.Â Â  So, too, on this divided peninsula.Â  The day all Koreans yearn for will not come easily or without great sacrifice.Â  But make no mistake, it will come.Â  And when it does, change will unfold that once seemed impossible.Â  And checkpoints will open and watchtowers will stand empty, and families long separated will finally be reunited.Â  And the Korean people, at long last, will be whole and free.Â Like our vision of a world without nuclear weapons, our vision of a Korea that stands as one may not be reached quickly.Â  But from this day until then, and all the days that follow, we take comfort in knowing that the security we seek, the peace we want, is closer at hand because of the great alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea; and because we stand for the dignity and freedom of all Koreans.Â  And no matter the test, no matter the trial, we stand together.Â  We work together.Â  We go together. Katchi kapshida!Â Thank you very much.","The White House is seeking to use China to try to establish a more productive relationship with North Korea's new leader, Kim Jong Eun, with President Barack Obama asking Chinese President Hu Jintao to take a sharper approach with Pyongyang.

U.S. officials said their initial efforts were encouraging because Mr. Hu told Mr. Obama on Monday that China is frustrated with North Korea's new leadership and indicated Beijing may use its influence with Pyongyang to more strongly press its ally to scrap plans for a mid-April satellite launch.

China didn't confirm the U.S. characterization of the 90-minute meeting, which took place on the sidelines of a nuclear-security summit

Ben Rhodes, a U.S. deputy national-security adviser, said Mr. Hu conveyed to Mr. Obama that the Chinese ""share the frustration with the choices that North Korea has made."" The Chinese delegation gave the impression Beijing wants to work with the U.S. and its allies, he said.

It remains unclear what pressure the Chinese might apply on Pyongyang, if any. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to comment on what Messrs. Hu and Obama talked about. The Chinese delegation in Seoul referred to China's state-run news agency Xinhua for reports on the event.

Xinhua's report didn't refer to the satellite launch directly. It said Mr. Hu said at the meeting that China hopes the U.S. and North Korea ""will keep contacts and dialogue and honor the consensus reached between them, so as to improve their relations.""

Mr. Obama has sharpened his tone with North Korea in recent days, a shift prompted by the new government's plans for the satellite launch, which the U.S. believes is intended as a test firing of a missile.

While Beijing has warned of ""concerns"" over the rocket-launch plans, it remains reluctant to press it too far, worried about the effects of a potential collapse of the North's regime.

Mr. Rhodes said the Chinese agree with the U.S. that a North Korean satellite launch would be destabilizing for the region and will continue discussions with Pyongyang over the coming weeks. But he also cautioned that the administration is waiting to see how these discussions unfold.

The U.S. has said a launch would likely scuttle a recent deal that included food aid for North Korea. Days after the agreement Pyongyang announced the launch plans, an embarrassment for the Obama administration, which had been resistant to directly engage North Korea because of its history of reneging on agreements.","President Obama took North Korea's untested new leader, Kim Jong-un, to task on Monday, demanding that China curb his belligerent behavior and declaring that South Korea's economic and democratic achievements would inevitably triumph over the failure and isolation of the North.

In a blunt, 90-minute meeting with China's president, Hu Jintao, before a nuclear security summit meeting here, Mr. Obama pressed the Chinese leader to use his influence over North Korea to stop it from proceeding with a satellite launching next month, a White House official said.

Mr. Obama was clearly stung by the announcement of the impending satellite launching, which the United States has said will be a breach of North Korea's international obligations, and which came only 17 days after the Obama administration had tentatively agreed to send desperately needed food aid to the country.

But the president, the senior official said, was also latching on to the change in leadership in Pyongyang to try to break what Mr. Obama called a long cycle of provocations that were rewarded by countries anxious to ease tensions with an erratic nuclear-armed state.

""We need to have a serious conversation with the North Koreans where they understand that we're going to do things differently in the future,"" said the senior official, the deputy national security adviser, Benjamin J. Rhodes.

Mr. Hu told the president that China shared his concern about the satellite launching and had conveyed that to North Korea, Mr. Rhodes said. But Mr. Hu appeared to be surprised by the vehemence of Mr. Obama's message, senior officials said.

In that meeting, as well as an earlier one with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, Mr. Obama was trying to nudge two countries that have been the greatest impediments to more aggressive action against North Korea, Iran and Syria, where a bloody crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad against his opponents is now nearly 13 months old.

Mr. Obama's meetings had a valedictory feel. It was Mr. Medvedev's last session with him before being replaced by Russia's president-elect, Vladimir V. Putin. And it may be one of the last times Mr. Obama meets with Mr. Hu or President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, both of whose terms expire next year.

Still, the president's mind seemed most fixed on a young man whom he has never met: Kim Jong-un, the new leader of North Korea, who assumed power on the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in December.

Mr. Obama, speaking to 400 students at a foreign affairs university here, challenged Mr. Kim and his subordinates to give up their belligerent behavior and ""have the courage to pursue peace and give a better life to the people of North Korea.""

The president spoke at length about a potential future reunification of the Korean Peninsula, describing the Koreans as ""one people,"" and saying that ""if just given the chance, if given their freedom, Koreans in the North are capable of great progress as well.""

Mr. Obama, who held the first nuclear security summit meeting in 2010, offered a report card on his campaign to prod countries to curb the spread of nuclear material and reduce the risk of nuclear terrorism.

But the most noteworthy elements of his speech were his admiration for South Korea and criticism of its estranged northern neighbor, which has barraged the South with threats.

Addressing Pyongyang directly, Mr. Obama said, ""Your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek; they have undermined it.""

The United States, he said, bore North Korea no ""hostile intent."" But if the country did not change course, he said, it would face ""more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.""

Drawing an analogy to the once-divided Germany, Mr. Obama spoke of his visit to the demilitarized zone on Sunday, where he peered into a country whose leaders, he said, are willing to allow their people to starve. The two Koreas, he said, will inevitably be reunified.

When they are, Mr. Obama said to applause, ""change will unfold that once seemed impossible. And checkpoints will open and watchtowers will stand empty, and families long separated will finally be reunited. And the Korean people, at long last, will be whole and free.""

Mr. Obama, who noted that he had visited Seoul three times as president -- more than any other foreign capital -- sprinkled his speech with Korean phrases and references to Korean social media services.

There was no immediate reaction from Pyongyang to Mr. Obama's remarks. The North's state-run Korea Central News Agency's Web site was monopolized Monday by dispatches about grief-stricken North Koreans participating in ceremonies observing the 100-day mourning period for Kim Jong-il.

Turning to the issue of nuclear security, Mr. Obama hailed successes like Georgia and Moldova, where authorities seized highly enriched uranium from smugglers. He praised Ukraine, which announced it had moved all highly enriched uranium out of the country.

The killing of Osama bin Laden and the crippling of Al Qaeda, the president said, meant that ""a terrorist organization that has actively sought nuclear weapons is now on the path to defeat.""

But Mr. Obama acknowledged unfinished business, notably with North Korea and Iran, with whom the West, supported by Russia and China, is preparing to hold another round of talks over its nuclear program. ""There is time to solve this diplomatically,"" he said, ""but time is short.""

The president said he remained committed to the goal he set in a speech in Prague in 2009: A world without nuclear weapons. The United States, he added, had a ""unique responsibility to act.""

""I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,"" Mr. Obama said. ""I say it as a commander in chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side.""",2012-03-27,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.993, NEU: 0.005, NEG: 0.002})",0.9925132393836975,0.00537382997572422,0.002112920628860593,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.744, POS: 0.251, NEG: 0.005})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.827, POS: 0.149, NEG: 0.024})",0.250808447599411,0.7437768578529358,0.005414725746959448,0.14895325899124146,0.8272324800491333,0.023814287036657333
41,41,2012-03-31-OilIran.txt,"Thank you very much.Â  Everybody, please have a seat.Â  Sorry weâre running just a little bit behind, but I figured itâs a great day to enjoy the Rose Garden. Today, members of Congress have a simple choice to make:Â  They can stand with the big oil companies, or they can stand with the American people.Â  Right now, the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits â- profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station.Â  But on top of these record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year -- billions a year in taxpayer subsidies -- a subsidy that theyâve enjoyed year after year for the last century. Think about that.Â  Itâs like hitting the American people twice.Â  Youâre already paying a premium at the pump right now.Â  And on top of that, Congress, up until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry. Itâs not as if these companies canât stand on their own.Â  Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits.Â  Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.Â  And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companiesâ profits.Â  In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits.Â  Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because weâre giving them billions in tax giveaways every year. Now, I want to make clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy.Â  We want U.S. oil companies to be doing well.Â  We want them to succeed.Â  Thatâs why under my administration, weâve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil and gas production.Â  Weâve quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high.Â  Weâve added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some.Â  And just yesterday, we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic. So the fact is, weâre producing more oil right now than we have in eight years, and weâre importing less of it as well.Â  For two years in a row, America has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home -- for the first time in over a decade.Â  So American oil is booming.Â  The oil industry is doing just fine.Â  With record profits and rising production, Iâm not worried about the big oil companies.Â  With high oil prices around the world, theyâve got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil.Â  Thatâs why I think itâs time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank.Â  And I think itâs curious that some folks in Congress, who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies. Instead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry thatâs never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double-down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising -- investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments in fuel-efficient cars and trucks, and energy-efficient homes and buildings.Â  Thatâs the future.Â  Thatâs the only way we're going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year.Â  As the economy is growing, the only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly.Â  Thatâs not the kind of pattern that we want to be in.Â  We want the economy doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs. And keep in mind, we canât just drill our way out of this problem.Â  As I said, oil production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's been doing well even as gas prices are going up.Â  Well, the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the worldâs oil but we only have 2 percent of the worldâs known oil reserves.Â  And that means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow but weâd still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference.Â  Weâd still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs.Â  And because itâs a world market, the fact that weâre doing more here in the United States doesnât necessarily help us because even U.S. oil companies theyâre selling that oil on a worldwide market.Â  Theyâre not keeping it just for us.Â  And that means that if thereâs rising demand around the world then the prices are going to up. Thatâs not the future that I want for America.Â  I donât want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that thereâs some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators get nervous about whether thereâs going to be enough supply.Â  I donât want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world.Â  I want us to control our own destiny.Â  I want us to forge our own future.Â  And thatâs why, as long as Iâm President, America is going to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way.Â  But it also means that weâre going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across America.Â  Weâre going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power thatâs already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs.Â  Weâre going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks instead of every week.Â  Weâre going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that youâre in charge of your own energy bills.Â  Weâre going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource:Â  American ingenuity and American imagination.Â  Thatâs what we need to keep going.Â  Thatâs whatâs at stake right now.Â  Thatâs the choice that we face.Â  And thatâs the choice thatâs facing Congress today.Â  They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that arenât needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future.Â  Itâs that simple.Â  And as long as Iâm President, Iâm betting on the future.Â  And as the people Iâve talked to around the country, including the people who are behind me here today, they put their faith in the future as well.Â  Thatâs what we do as Americans.Â  Thatâs who we are.Â  We innovate.Â  We discover.Â  We seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges.Â  And, ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed.Â  And I believe that weâre going to do that again.Â  Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith. Thank you very much, everybody.","The White House cleared the way for tough new sanctions on Iran on Friday, saying a cutoff of Iranian oil wouldn't significantly harm world markets.

The move, which was expected, allows the U.S. to move forward with new penalties approved last year by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama to target financial institutions doing business with Iran's central bank, a key conduit for the country's oil sales.

The sanctions provisions, part of a defense spending law, required the president to determine whether the nation could withstand the possible oil disruption that resulted.

The president said in a finding there was ""sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran"" to cushion the impact of sanctions on oil markets.

Also Friday, officials in Turkey, also an Iranian customer, said they would reduce purchases of Iranian oil by 10% and replace it with Libyan oil. Ankara's move came a day after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan returned from Iran.

Mr. Obama's move comes amid rising gasoline prices across the country, a growing issue in political campaigns. Republicans are unlikely to criticize sanctions against Iran, but are certain to blame any resulting price increases on White House policies.

The sanctions, which take effect June 28, are part of a broader effort to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. U.S. and European Union countries say Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon, while Iran says its intentions are peaceful. Among other steps, the European Union is instituting an oil embargo beginning July 1.

The sanctions, intended to drive Iran toward compromise on it nuclear program, are having a ""significant impact"" on Iran's government and economy, a senior administration official said Friday. Iran has agreed to return to talks with world powers, with negotiations likely to begin in mid-April in Turkey.

Iran is the world's No. 3 exporter of crude oil, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration, raising the possibility that sanctions might remove a significant amount of oil from the global market.

Saudi Arabia has been seen as key to filling the gap left by Iranian cutbacks. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, meeting with Saudi King Abdullah in Riyadh Friday, raised the issue of how to maintain stability in the oil markets, according to U.S. officials.

In recent weeks, oil markets have factored in the possibility that sanctions might take a significant amount of oil off the market. The price of crude in New York trading gained $4.19 per barrel in the first quarter, or 4.24%, closing at $103.02 Friday.

Obama administration officials have hinted in recent weeks that tapping the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve was a tool available to calm oil markets.","After careful analysis of oil prices and months of negotiations, President Obama on Friday determined that there was sufficient oil in world markets to allow countries to significantly reduce their Iranian imports, clearing the way for Washington to impose severe new sanctions intended to slash Iran's oil revenue and press Tehran to abandon its nuclear ambitions.

The White House announcement comes after months of back-channel talks to prepare the global energy market to cut Iran out -- but without raising the price of oil, which would benefit Iran and harm the economies of the United States and Europe.

Since the sanctions became law in December, administration officials have encouraged oil exporters with spare capacity, particularly Saudi Arabia, to increase their production. They have discussed with Britain and France releasing their oil reserves in the event of a supply disruption.

And they have conducted a high-level campaign of shuttle diplomacy to try to persuade other countries, like China, Japan and South Korea, to buy less oil and demand discounts from Iran, in compliance with the sanctions.

The goal is to sap the Iranian government of oil revenue that might go to finance the country's nuclear program. Already, the pending sanctions have led to a decrease in oil exports and a sharp decline in the value of the country's currency, the rial, against the dollar and euro.

Administration officials described the Saudis as willing and eager, at least since talks started last fall, to undercut the Iranians.

One senior official who had met with the Saudi leadership, said: ""There was no resistance. They are more worried about a nuclear Iran than the Israelis are.""

Still officials said, the administration wanted to be sure that the Saudis were not talking a bigger game than they could deliver. The Saudis received a parade of visitors, including some from the Energy Department, to make the case that they had the technical capacity to pump out significantly more oil.

But some American officials remain skeptical. That is one reason Mr. Obama left open the option of reviewing this decision every few months. ""We won't know what the Saudis can do until we test it, and we're about to,"" the official said.

Worldwide demand for oil was another critical element of the equation that led to the White House decision on sanctions. Now, projections for demand are lower than expected because of the combination of rising oil prices, the European financial crisis and a modest slowdown in growth in China.

As one official said, ""No one wants to wish for slowdown, but demand may be the most important factor.""

Nonetheless, the sanctions pose a serious challenge for the United States. Already, concerns over a confrontation with Iran and the loss of its oil -- Iran was the third-biggest exporter of crude in 2010 -- have driven oil prices up about 20 percent this year.

A gallon of gas currently costs $3.92, on average, up from about $3.20 a gallon in December. The rising prices have weighed on economic confidence and cut into household budgets, a concern for an Obama administration seeking re-election.

On Friday afternoon, oil prices on commodity markets closed at $103.02 a barrel, up 24 cents for the day.

Moreover, the new sanctions -- which effectively force countries to choose between doing business with the United States and buying oil from Iran -- threaten to fray diplomatic relationships with close allies that buy some of their crude from Tehran, like South Korea.

But in a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials said they were confident that they could put the sanctions in effect without damaging the global economy.

Iran currently exports about 2.2 million barrels of crude oil a day, according to the economic analysis company IHS Global Insight, and other oil producers will look to make up much of that capacity, as countries buy less and less oil from Iran. A number of countries are producing more petroleum, including the United States itself, which should help to make up the gap.

Most notably, Saudi Arabia, the world's single biggest producer, has promised to pump more oil to bring prices down.

""There is no rational reason why oil prices are continuing to remain at these high levels,"" the Saudi oil minister, Ali Naimi, wrote in an opinion article in The Financial Times this week. ""I hope by speaking out on the issue that our intentions -- and capabilities -- are clear,"" he said. ""We want to see stronger European growth and realize that reasonable crude oil prices are key to this.""

By certifying that there is enough supply available, the administration is also trying to gain some leverage over Iran before a resumption of negotiations, expected on April 14.

The suggestion that Saudi Arabia is prepared to make up for any lost Iranian production is intended to remove Iran's ability to threaten a major disruption in the world oil supply if it does not cede to Western and United Nations demands to halt uranium enrichment.

However, administration officials concede that it is unclear how the oil markets will react to Iranian threats even with the president's latest certification that there is sufficient oil to fill the gap. ""We just don't know how much negotiating advantage we have gained,"" said one senior administration official who has been involved in developing the policy.

In a statement, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said the administration acknowledged that the oil market had become increasingly tight, with output just besting demand.

""Nonetheless, there currently appears to be sufficient supply of non-Iranian oil to permit foreign countries"" to cut imports, he said.

American officials have also discussed a coordinated release of oil from the national strategic reserves with French and British officials.

Some energy experts question whether Saudi Arabia really has enough spare capacity to make up for the loss of Iran's oil. But the determination of the United States and Europe to combat high prices might be enough to quiet the markets.

The White House ""can have a very limited material impact on the size of supplies,"" said David J. Rothkopf, the president of Garten Rothkopf, a Washington-based consultancy. ""But they can have a much larger impact on perceptions. In this case, it's not so much the producers as the energy traders who are moving market prices -- and that's where the White House wants to play a role.""

Additionally, the White House has the ability under the law to waive the new sanctions if they threaten national security or if oil prices spurt, increasing the flow of money to Iran's government.",2012-03-31,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.851, NEU: 0.131, NEG: 0.018})",0.850587785243988,0.13095086812973022,0.018461348488926888,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.727, POS: 0.265, NEG: 0.008})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.793, POS: 0.175, NEG: 0.032})",0.26480886340141296,0.7267724275588989,0.008418719284236431,0.17539963126182556,0.7926349639892578,0.031965434551239014
42,42,2012-04-29-WHCorrespondentsDinner.txt,"Thank you.  Good evening, everybody.  Good evening.  I could not be more thrilled to be here tonight -- at the White House Correspondentsâ Dinner.  This is great crowd.  Theyâre already laughing.  Itâs terrific.

Chuck Todd -- love you, brother.  Iâm delighted to see some of the cast members of Glee are here.  And Jimmy Kimmel, itâs an honor, man.  Whatâs so funny?

My fellow Americans, we gather during a historic anniversary.  Last year at this time -- in fact, on this very weekend -- we finally delivered justice to one of the worldâs most notorious individuals. [photo of Donald Trump appears onscreen] Now, this year, we gather in the midst of a heated election season.  And Axelrod tells me I should never miss a chance to reintroduce myself to the American people.  So tonight, this is how Iâd like to begin:  My name is Barack Obama.  My mother was born in Kansas.  My father was born in Kenya.  And I was born, of course, in Hawaii.

In 2009, I took office in the face of some enormous challenges.  Now, some have said I blame too many problems on my predecessor, but letâs not forget thatâs a practice that was initiated by George W. Bush.  Since then, Congress and I have certainly had our differences; yet, Iâve tried to be civil, to not take any cheap shots.  And thatâs why I want to especially thank all the members who took a break from their exhausting schedule of not passing any laws to be here tonight.  Letâs give them a big round of applause.

Despite many obstacles, much has changed during my time in office.  Four years ago, I was locked in a brutal primary battle with Hillary Clinton.  Four years later, she wonât stop drunk-texting me from Cartagena.

Four years ago, I was a Washington outsider.  Four years later, Iâm at this dinner.  Four years ago, I looked like this.  Today, I look like this.  And four years from now, I will look like this.  Thatâs not even funny.

Anyway, itâs great to be here this evening in the vast, magnificent Hilton ballroom -- or what Mitt Romney would call a little fixer-upper.  I mean, look at this party.  Weâve got men in tuxes, women in gowns, fine wine, first-class entertainment.  I was just relieved to learn this was not a GSA conference.  Unbelievable.  Not even the mind reader knew what they were thinking.

Of course, the White House Correspondentsâ Dinner is known as the prom of Washington D.C. -- a term coined by political reporters who clearly never had the chance to go to an actual prom.

Our chaperone for the evening is Jimmy Kimmel -- who is perfect for the job since most of tonightâs audience is in his key demographic -- people who fall asleep during Nightline.  Jimmy got his start years ago on The Man Show.  In Washington, thatâs what we call a congressional hearing on contraception.

And plenty of journalists are here tonight.  I'd be remiss if I didnât congratulate the Huffington Post on their Pulitzer Prize.  You deserve it, Arianna.  There's no one else out there linking to the kinds of hard-hitting journalism that HuffPo is linking to every single day.  Give them a round of applause.  And you donât pay them -- it's a great business model.

Even Sarah Palin is getting back into the game, guest hosting on The Today Show -- which reminds me of an old saying:  What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull?  A pit bull is delicious.  A little soy sauce.

Now, I know at this point many of you are expecting me to go after my likely opponent, Newt Gingrich.  Newt, there's still time, man.  But I'm not going to do that -- I'm not going to attack any of the Republican candidates.  Take Mitt Romney -- he and I actually have a lot in common.  We both think of our wives as our better halves, and polls show, to a alarmingly insulting extent, the American people agree.  We also both have degrees from Harvard; I have one, he has two.  What a snob.

Of course, we've also had our differences.  Recently, his campaign criticized me for slow jamming the news with Jimmy Fallon.  In fact, I understand Governor Romney was so incensed he asked his staff if he could get some equal time on The Merv Griffin Show.  Still, I guess Governor Romney is feeling pretty good about things because he took a few hours off the other day to see The Hunger Games -- some of you have seen it.  It's a movie about people who court wealthy sponsors and then brutally savage each other until only one contestant is left standing.  I'm sure this was a really good change of pace for him.  I have not seen The Hunger Games; not enough class warfare for me.

Of course, I know everybody is predicting a nasty election, and thankfully, we've all agreed that families are off limits.  Dogs, however, are apparently fair game.  And while both campaigns have had some fun with this, the other day I saw a new ad from one of these outside groups that, frankly, I think crossed the line.  I know Governor Romney says he has no control over what his super PACs do, but can we show the ad real quick?

Thatâs pretty rough -- but I can take it, because my stepfather always told me, it's a boy-eat-dog world out there.

Now, if I do win a second term as President, let me just say something to all the -- let me just say something to all my conspiracy-oriented friends on the right who think I'm planning to unleash some secret agenda:  You're absolutely right.  So allow me to close with a quick preview of the secret agenda you can expect in a second Obama administration. 

In my first term, I sang Al Green; in my second term, I'm going with Young Jeezy.

Michelle said, yeah.  I sing that to her sometimes.

In my first term, we ended the war in Iraq; in my second term, I will win the war on Christmas.   In my first term, we repealed the policy known as ""don't ask, don't tell"" -- wait, though; in my second term, we will replace it with a policy known as, it's raining men.  In my first term, we passed health care reform; in my second term, I guess I'll pass it again.

I do want to end tonight on a slightly more serious note -- whoever takes the oath of office next January will face some great challenges, but he will also inherit traditions that make us greater than the challenges we face.  And one of those traditions is represented here tonight: a free press that isn't afraid to ask questions, to examine and to criticize.  And in service of that mission, all of you make sacrifices. 

Tonight, we remember journalists such as Anthony Shadid and Marie Colvin -- who made the ultimate sacrifice as they sought to shine a light on some of the most important stories of our time.  So whether you are a blogger or a broadcaster, whether you take on powerful interests here at home or put yourself in harm's way overseas, I have the greatest respect and admiration for what you do.  I know sometimes you like to give me a hard time -- and I certainly like to return the favor -- but I never forget that our country depends on you.  You help protect our freedom, our democracy, and our way of life. 

And just to set the record straight, I really do enjoy attending these dinners.  In fact, I had a lot more material prepared, but I have to get the Secret Service home in time for their new curfew.

Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.
","""You found each other,"" said a publicist to a circle of party reporters at the residence of the French Ambassador Saturday night.

It hadn't been too difficult. At the annual Vanity Fair/Bloomberg post-White House Correspondents Dinner party, we were the not-George-Clooneys, grabbing mini-lobster-rolls and shrimp cocktail from cater waiters in mascara and fighting famous-face fatigue.

Editor Graydon Carter, in a tux, presided over the party, which was arguably the most rarified ticket at the capital over the weekend, second to the Correspondents Dinner itself. (""If you're skeptical of social Darwinism, try getting into the Bloomberg party,"" Bloomberg reporter Joshua Green wrote on Twitter.)

Even Ivanka Trump and Mr. Carter himself briefly waited on line outside the mansion's gates -- in the rain, no less -- before entering the party, held on the ground floor of the regal building.

Eventually, those who made the cut walked past a sprawling lawn, multiple publicists, security guards, and, at the door, ""Hunger Games"" star Josh Hutcherson, 19 years old.

In the sense that it was as glamorous as a Fellini film and as strange as a Bunuel film, the party lived up to its reputation. Twenty-something bloggers, downing vodka-tonics, smiled at Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who, before ducking out, chatted with actress Reese Witherspoon; party reporters kept their tape-recorders hidden, as per the demands of publicists, while murmuring questions to Aziz Ansari; a pool out back begged for a night swim.

It might be easier to list which celebrities weren't inside -- Lindsay Lohan and Kim Kardashian, despite attending the Correspondents Dinner, were not at the Vanity Fair party. The ones we spotted included but were not limited to: Judd Apatow, looking uncharacteristically dapper, bow-tie and all; Harvey Weinstein, chatting up guests in the foyer; Rahm Emanuel, saying hello to Ms. Witherspoon; and Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Mr. Bloomberg had already been in the same room as Ms. Kardashian and Rick Santorum that day. Who was he more excited to meet?

""I have no idea,"" he said. ""I'm most excited to meet you!"" (We've met before.)

Prior to the Vanity Fair fete, media outlets threw pre-dinner cocktail parties in conference and hotel rooms all over the Washington Hilton.

Zooey Deschanel shook many hands in the Bloomberg room, where bacon-wrapped scallops were served; Kelly Ripa stopped by the USA Today room, where sushi was served, and glanced at herself in a pocket mirror. A long line of autograph-seekers, amateur and professional photographers and gawking hotel guests assembled in the lobby to people-watch.

That was only Saturday.

The evening prior to the dinner, guests at the New Yorker's party drank Champagne and slurped oysters on the roof of the W Hotel, which overlooks the White House and the National Mall.

The cocktail napkins had the magazine's cartoons printed on them, and the guests were sent home with small boxes of doughnut holes.

Identically dressed iPad-toting DJ duo Andrew Andrew roamed the media-heavy crowd, which included such ideological foes as Sen. Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, and MSNBC host Ed Schultz.

Obama-confidante Valerie Jarrett made an appearance, as did Jesse Tyler Ferguson from ""Modern Family.""

Eventually, the air-kissing, odd-couple-networking and heavy drinking moved to a subterranean party hosted by the Atlantic. The century-and-a-half old title, which has recently been making an online push, chose a fitting setting: a former Borders in downtown Washington. Cleared of books but with the ceiling tiles and carpet left in place, it had the feel of a suburban basement, but with better drinks, louder music and Woody Harrelson.

Past midnight on Saturday, during our escape from the ambassador's mansion, a mess of black umbrellas outside the residence almost caused us to stumble. ""There is no way any of us will find our umbrellas in this pile,"" a guest rightfully announced.

Mr. Hutcherson, by the door, laughed knowingly. Even the nation's leading famous people have those sorts of everyday mix-ups, we thought.

Or maybe everything really is more fun for them.

""If you can't find yours,"" said a woman carefully guarding the entrance: ""Then we'll make sure you traded up.""","President Obama poked fun at himself, Congress, the Secret Service, the media and particularly his rival Mitt Romney on Saturday night, mocking his Republican opponent as a fuddy-duddy rich guy who travels with his dog in a cage strapped to the roof of the family car.

Delivering the traditionally comic remarks at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner, the president seemed to enjoy needling Mr. Romney just days after the general election contest effectively got underway. The highlight was a spoof Romney ad showing the former governor at the door of Air Force One with a dog cage on top of the aircraft.

Families are off limits, Mr. Obama declared. ""Dogs, however, are apparently fair game,"" he said.

Mr. Obama pointed out that he was speaking in a cavernous hotel ballroom, or ""what Mitt Romney would call a little fixer-upper."" He noted that he and Mr. Romney both have degrees from Harvard University, but the Republican has two. ""What a snob,"" Mr. Obama joked. And he said after his own appearance on Jimmy Fallon's show this week, Mr. Romney ""asked if he could get some equal time on 'The Merv Griffin Show.' ""

Appearing before the official entertainer of the evening, Jimmy Kimmel, Mr. Obama also took aim at a couple of other Republican critics. Noting the presence of Newt Gingrich, who plans to drop out of the Republican race next week, Mr. Obama called out, ""Newt there's still time, man!""

And he took aim at Sarah Palin, mocking her famous line from the 2008 convention as well as Republican criticism of him for eating dog meat while a boy in Indonesia. ""What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull?"" Mr. Obama asked. ""A pit bull is delicious."" (Even Michelle Obama looked askance at that one.)

He took a jab at Congress, thanking lawmakers who ""took a break from their exhausting schedule of not passing any laws to be here tonight."" He teased Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was photographed dancing and drinking a beer at a club during a visit to Colombia. ""She won't stop drunk-texting me from Cartagena,"" the president said.

And of course, he ribbed his own security detail after the prostitution scandal involving the Secret Service on that same trip to Colombia, declaring that he had to leave early because ""I have to get the Secret Service home in time for their new curfew.""

Mr. Kimmel also went after the Secret Service during his routine. ""I do have a lot of jokes about the Secret Service,"" he said. ""You know, I told them for $800 I wouldn't tell them, but they only offered 30.""

The dinner has long since morphed from a gathering of journalists and their sources into a peculiar ritual marrying Washington, New York and Hollywood cultures and celebrities.

In addition to the president and the usual array of cabinet secretaries, senators, House members and television pundits, boldfaced names spotted at this year's dinner included George Clooney, Lindsay Lohan, Goldie Hawn, Claire Danes, Kim Kardashian, Diane Keaton and others.

Just last year, the dinner played a cameo role in the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. When he showed up at the dinner, Mr. Obama had just given the order for the helicopter incursion into Pakistan to burst into a compound where the Al Qaeda leader was suspected of living. But he smiled and joked his way through the dinner, and a ballroom full of journalists had no clue what was about to happen.",2012-04-29,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.992, NEU: 0.005, NEG: 0.003})",0.9919658899307251,0.004668786656111479,0.0033653515856713057,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.728, POS: 0.267, NEG: 0.006})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.766, POS: 0.132, NEG: 0.102})",0.2668124735355377,0.7276664972305298,0.005521050654351711,0.13209214806556702,0.7662194967269897,0.10168838500976562
43,43,2012-05-02-VisitsAfghanistan.txt,"

Good evening from Bagram Air Base. This outpost is more than 7,000 miles from home, but for over a decade, it's been close to our hearts. Because here in Afghanistan, more than half a million of our sons and daughters have sacrificed to protect our country.

Today I signed a historic agreement between the United States and Afghanistan that defines a new kind of relationship between our countries, a future in which Afghans are responsible for the security of their nation and we build an equal partnership between two sovereign states, a future in which war ends and a new chapter begins.

Tonight I'd like to speak to you about this transition. But first, let us remember why we came here. It was here, in Afghanistan, where Usama bin Laden established a safe haven for his terrorist organization. It was here, in Afghanistan, where Al Qaida brought new recruits, trained them, and plotted acts of terror. It was here, from within these borders, that Al Qaida launched the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, and children.

And so, 10 years ago, the United States and our allies went to war to make sure that Al Qaida could never again use this country to launch attacks against us. Despite initial success, for a number of reasons, this war has taken longer than most anticipated. In 2002, bin Laden and his lieutenants escaped across the border and established safe haven in Pakistan. America spent nearly 8 years fighting a different war in Iraq. And Al Qaida's extremist allies within the Taliban have waged a brutal insurgency.

But over the last 3 years, the tide has turned. We broke the Taliban's momentum. We built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated Al Qaida's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And 1 year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Usama bin Laden. The goal that I set to defeat Al Qaida and deny it a chance to rebuild is now within our reach.

Still, there will be difficult days ahead. The enormous sacrifices of our men and women are not over. But tonight I'd like to tell you how we will complete our mission and end the war in Afghanistan.

First, we've begun a transition to Afghan responsibility for security. Already, nearly half of the Afghan people live in places where Afghan security forces are moving into the lead. This month, at a NATO summit in Chicago, our coalition will set a goal for Afghan forces to be in the lead for combat operations across the country next year. International troops will continue to train, advise, and assist the Afghans, and fight alongside them when needed. But we will shift into a support role as Afghans step forward.

As we do, our troops will be coming home. Last year, we removed 10,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Another 23,000 will leave by the end of the summer. After that, reductions will continue at a steady pace, with more and more of our troops coming home. And as our coalition agreed, by the end of 2014, the Afghans will be fully responsible for the security of their country.

Second, we are training Afghan security forces to get the job done. Those forces have surged and will peak at 352,000 this year. The Afghans will sustain that level for 3 years and then reduce the size of their military. And in Chicago, we will endorse a proposal to support a strong and sustainable long-term Afghan force.

Third, we're building an enduring partnership. The agreement we signed today sends a clear message to the Afghan people: As you stand up, you will not stand alone. It establishes the basis for our cooperation over the next decade, including shared commitments to combat terrorism and strengthen democratic institutions. It supports Afghan efforts to advance development and dignity for their people. And it includes Afghan commitments to transparency and accountability and to protect the human rights of all Afghans: men and women, boys and girls.

Within this framework, we'll work with the Afghans to determine what support they need to accomplish two narrow security missions beyond 2014: counterterrorism and continued training. But we will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains. That will be the job of the Afghan people.

Fourth, we're pursuing a negotiated peace. In coordination with the Afghan Government, my administration has been in direct discussions with the Taliban. We've made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with Al Qaida, renounce violence, and abide by Afghan laws. Many members of the Taliban--from foot soldiers to leaders--have indicated an interest in reconciliation. The path to peace is now set before them. Those who refuse to walk it will face strong Afghan security forces, backed by the United States and our allies.

Fifth, we are building a global consensus to support peace and stability in South Asia. In Chicago, the international community will express support for this plan and for Afghanistan's future. And I have made it clear to its neighbor Pakistan that it can and should be an equal partner in this process in a way that respects Pakistan's sovereignty, interests, and democratic institutions. In pursuit of a durable peace, America has no designs beyond an end to Al Qaida safe havens and respect for Afghan sovereignty.

As we move forward, some people will ask why we need a firm timeline. The answer is clear: Our goal is not to build a country in America's image or to eradicate every vestige of the Taliban. These objectives would require many more years, many more dollars, and most importantly, many more American lives. Our goal is to destroy Al Qaida, and we are on a path to do exactly that. Afghans want to assert their sovereignty and build a lasting peace. That requires a clear timeline to wind down the war.

Others will ask, why don't we leave immediately? That answer is also clear: We must give Afghanistan the opportunity to stabilize. Otherwise, our gains could be lost, and Al Qaida could establish itself once more. And as Commander in Chief, I refuse to let that happen.

I recognize that many Americans are tired of war. As President, nothing is more wrenching than signing a letter to a family of the fallen or looking into the eyes of a child who will grow up without a mother or father. I will not keep Americans in harm's way a single day longer than is absolutely required for our national security. But we must finish the job we started in Afghanistan and end this war responsibly.

My fellow Americans, we've traveled through more than a decade under the dark cloud of war. Yet, here in the predawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon. The Iraq war is over. The number of our troops in harm's way has been cut in half, and more will soon be coming home. We have a clear path to fulfill our mission in Afghanistan, while delivering justice to Al Qaida.

This future is only within reach because of our men and women in uniform. Time and again, they have answered the call to serve in distant and dangerous places. In an age when so many institutions have come up short, these Americans stood tall. They met their responsibilities to one another and to the flag they serve under. I just met with some of them and told them that as Commander in Chief, I could not be prouder. And in their faces, we see what is best in ourselves and our country.

Our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, marines, coastguardsmen, and civilians in Afghanistan have done their duty. Now we must summon that same sense of common purpose. We must give our veterans and military families the support they deserve and the opportunities they have earned. And we must redouble our efforts to build a nation worthy of their sacrifice.

As we emerge from a decade of conflict abroad and economic crisis at home, it's time to renew America. An America where our children live free from fear and have the skills to claim their dreams, a united America of grit and resilience, where sunlight glistens off soaring new towers in downtown Manhattan and we build our future as one people, as one Nation.

Here in Afghanistan, Americans answered the call to defend their fellow citizens and uphold human dignity. Today we recall the fallen and those who suffered wounds, both seen and unseen. But through dark days, we have drawn strength from their example and the ideals that have guided our Nation and led the world: a belief that all people are treated equal and deserve the freedom to determine their destiny. That is the light that guides us still.

This time of war began in Afghanistan, and this is where it will end. With faith in each other and our eyes fixed on the future, let us finish the work at hand and forge a just and lasting peace.

May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America.

","President Barack Obama made a symbolic trip to Afghanistan on Tuesday, arriving on the first anniversary of the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to sign an agreement with President Hamid Karzai that marks a transition in the war while committing the U.S. to another decade of economic and military aid.

Mr. Obama said the Strategic Partnership Agreement he signed in Kabul would allow the U.S. to disentangle from Afghanistan, while not specifying funding or troop levels.

The trip came amid complaints by critics that Mr. Obama has politicized bin Laden's death. The president drew cheers in a speech to troops for his mention of the U.S. raid that killed the mastermind behind the attacks that sparked the decadelong war.

""We did not choose this war. This war came to us on 9/11,"" Mr. Obama told U.S. troops who had gathered at Bagram Air Base.

He also delivered a rare prime-time televised address in which he assured Americans that the U.S. role in Afghanistan is shrinking while also promising long-term aid to the Afghans. ""I recognize that many Americans are tired of war,"" Mr. Obama said. ""But we must finish the job we started in Afghanistan and end this war responsibly.""

Hours after Mr. Obama delivered his predawn speech and left Afghanistan, insurgents attacked a fortified compound that houses thousands of Westerners, including U.S. Department of Defense contractors and European Union police trainers, on the outskirts of Kabul.

Insurgents used at least two car bombs to attack the front gate of Green Village before other attackers stormed the gate and got inside the parking lot of the compound, according to one resident of the compound.

Well-armed contractors defended the facility as insurgents used rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns to try to attack, the resident said. Several Westerners were injured in the assault, but security managed to contain the attackers, he said. An hour after the attack, only one insurgent remained contained on the compound. The Kabul police chief at the scene said that six people were killed, including one Afghan student and one guard at Green Village.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told The Wall Street Journal that the attack was a direct response to the president's visit. ""This delivers a message to President Obama that he is not welcome in Afghanistan,"" said Mr. Mujahid. ""When he is in Afghanistan, we want him to hear the sound of explosions. Afghanistan does not want his imposed strategy.""

Hours earlier, Mr. Obama said his administration has been in direct talks with the Taliban, the first public acknowledgment of the negotiations by the president.

""We have made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with al Qaeda, renounce violence and abide by Afghan laws,"" Mr. Obama said.

But senior administration officials said Tuesday that a key part of those talks, a deal to open a Taliban office in Qatar, had stalled. The pact Messrs. Obama and Karzai signed outlines a 10-year relationship between Afghanistan and the U.S. after most American forces withdraw from the country in 2014.

The White House said the deal ""provides for the possibility of U.S. forces in Afghanistan after 2014, for the purposes of training Afghan forces and targeting the remnants of al Qaeda."" Congress will help determine funding and troop levels, setting the stage for a potential political battle.

The agreement cements Afghanistan as a ""major non-NATO ally"" of the U.S., a designation meant to signify the country's role as an important American ally.

The deal also seeks to address regional concerns about American military influence in the region by clearly stating that the U.S. doesn't want permanent military bases in Afghanistan. Instead, American forces will rely on Afghan bases to stage missions to fight any remaining al Qaeda forces in the region and to train Afghan troops.

In return, U.S. negotiators secured assurances from Afghan officials that the nation would do more to combat corruption, which remains one of the most serious challenges to long-term stability in Afghanistan.

Mr. Obama called the signing of the agreement ""a historic moment for our two nations.""

His trip, which wasn't publicly announced beforehand for security reasons, follows a series of efforts by the White House and the Obama campaign to commemorate the bin Laden killing, which the president's advisers see as his crowning national-security achievement.

Those efforts have brought charges from Republicans, including presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney, that the president and his aides are inappropriately using the anniversary for political gain.

But Mr. Obama's drew praise from some GOP leaders for his Afghanistan strategy. Sen. Lindsay Graham (R., S.C.), a frequent critic, said the deal ""will help secure our nation and allies from future attacks using Afghanistan as a staging area."" Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who has complained about Mr. Obama's references to bin Laden, praised the president's trip to Afghanistan and said he hoped the new agreement ""will send a signal to friends and enemies in the region that the United States is committed to a secure and free Afghanistan.""

Senior administration officials, while acknowledging the symbolism of scheduling Mr. Obama's visit around the anniversary of bin Laden's death, told reporters traveling with the president that the trip was driven by negotiations over the strategic-partnership agreement.","President Obama, speaking to an American television audience on Tuesday night from Bagram Air Base, declared that he had traveled here to herald a new era in the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan, ""a future in which war ends, and a new chapter begins.""

Mr. Obama's address, during an unannounced visit to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that sets the terms for relations after the departure of American troops in 2014, was a chance for him to make an election-year case that he is winding down a costly and increasingly unpopular war.

""My fellow Americans,"" he said, speaking against a backdrop of armored military vehicles and an American flag, ""we've traveled through more than a decade under the dark cloud of war. Yet here, in the pre-dawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of new day on the horizon.""

His speech came as an already difficult relationship with Mr. Karzai has been strained by recent events, including the release of photos showing American soldiers posing with the remains of Taliban insurgents and an American staff sergeant who has been charged in the killing of 16 Afghan civilians. Mr. Obama sought to portray the withdrawal as an unalloyed achievement, though it remains far from certain that the Afghan government can hold its own against the Taliban with reduced American support, or that what were once considered critical American goals here can still be met.

Hours after Mr. Obama left Afghanistan, at least two explosions shook Kabul on Wednesday morning, near a compound used by United Nations workers and other foreigners, local reports said. According to an interior minister, at least six people, including five civilians and a security guard, were killed. The Taliban has claimed responsibility.

The president's dramatic six-hour visit, ending a year to the day after Osama bin Laden was killed in a raid in neighboring Pakistan, was laden with symbolism, historic and political. Speaking from the country where the 9/11 terrorist attacks were incubated, Mr. Obama suggested that America had come full circle.

""One year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden,"" the president said. ""The goal I set -- to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild -- is now within our reach.""

Asserting that the United States had largely achieved its military goals, Mr. Obama said that Afghans were ready to take responsibility for their own security, a transition that will start in earnest next year when American and NATO troops step back from a combat role to training and counterterrorism operations.

But Mr. Obama also spoke of an ""enduring partnership"" with Afghanistan, invoking the agreement, which pledges American help for a decade in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions, though it makes no concrete financial commitments, which Congress would have to authorize each year.

The agreement, Mr. Karzai said during a midnight signing ceremony at his presidential palace, opened ""a new chapter in the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan,"" one marked by ""mutual respect.""

Mr. Obama, who arrived after nightfall at Bagram Air Base north of Kabul under a veil of secrecy, flew by helicopter to the palace, passing low over the inky silhouette of the Hindu Kush Mountain range. Once there, he met briefly with Mr. Karzai before they emerged to sign the pact.

""With this agreement the Afghan people, and the world, should know that Afghanistan has a friend and a partner in the United States,"" Mr. Obama said as Mr. Karzai looked on, along with an audience of Afghan and American officials, including two Democratic senators, Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Carl Levin of Michigan.

As part of its effort to broker a political settlement between the Afghan government and insurgents, Mr. Obama said, ""my administration has been in direct discussion with the Taliban."" It was his most candid acknowledgment of the often-shadowy talks between American diplomats and the Taliban.

If Mr. Obama was emphasizing American constancy at the palace, his speech to his audience back home put greater emphasis on turning the page. The United States, he said, needed to turn its energies from war to rebuilding, a resilience that was on display on the site of the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City, where ""sunlight glistens off soaring new towers in downtown Manhattan.""

The president also answered critics, notably his likely Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, who said the administration erred by setting a deadline for withdrawing troops, since the Taliban could simply wait out the Americans.

""Our goal is not to build a country in American's image, or to eradicate every vestige of the Taliban,"" Mr. Obama said. ""These objectives would require many more years, many more dollars and many more American lives.""

The surprise trip came even as his re-election campaign set off a debate about the propriety of using Bin Laden's killing to make a political argument in the battle with Mr. Romney. But Republicans largely held their rhetorical fire in the hours after Mr. Obama's arrival in Afghanistan was made public.

In a statement issued after Mr. Obama left to return to Washington, Mr. Romney said he was ""pleased"" by the president trip. ""It would be a tragedy for Afghanistan and a strategic setback for America if the Taliban returned to power and once again created a sanctuary for terrorists,"" the statement said.

For the president, the visit showcased what his aides said was his determination to end the war responsibly, even as they conceded that the country American troops will leave behind will be a messy, violent place.

The president's view was reflected in the remarks of another senior official, who told reporters that the agreement will give the United States ""the capacity to carry out the counterterrorism operations that are necessary for Al Qaeda not to resettle."" It will help ensure ""a regional equilibrium that serves our national security interest. And that's ultimately why we went in there in the first place.""

Mr. Obama devoted much of his visit to the troops, visiting wounded soldiers at a hospital on Bagram Air Base, where he awarded 10 Purple Heart decorations, and speaking by radio to military personnel in other parts of the country who were involved in arranging his trip.

""The reason the Afghans have a new tomorrow is because of you,"" Mr. Obama said to 3,200 cheering troops assembled before dawn on Wednesday in a cavernous hangar, against a backdrop of an American flag and several armored vehicles.

The timing of the trip, administration officials said, was dictated by the desire of both presidents to sign the agreement before a NATO summit meeting in Chicago later this month. But it also came just four days before two big campaign rallies that serve as the symbolic kickoff of Mr. Obama's re-election bid, which will emphasize his success in ending the war in Iraq and winding down the conflict in Afghanistan.

With polls showing a large majority of Americans weary with the war, the president's aides have discussed whether to accelerate current plans, which call for withdrawing 23,000 troops by September. In Chicago, the United States and NATO allies will ratify a shift in the mission in 2013 from a combat role to one focused on counterterrorism and training of Afghan security forces.

For Mr. Obama, the visit was a chance to meet again with Mr. Karzai, with whom the United States has had a sometimes difficult relationship. On a stop here in March 2010, Mr. Obama delivered pointed criticism of Mr. Karzai for the rampant graft in the Afghan government. Ten months later, he made a return trip, only to be grounded at Bagram by swirling winds, forcing him to speak to Mr. Karzai by phone.

Though Mr. Karzai appeared elated at the ceremony, he has frequently expressed frustration with the American presence, bitterly criticizing the United States on issues like night raids conducted by Special Operations troops and civilian casualties.

The United States turned over authority for those raids to Afghan forces last month, opening the door to the broader agreement. The pact signed early Wednesday, negotiated by the American ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan C. Crocker, and Afghanistan's national security adviser, Rangin Dadfar Spanta, addresses a broad range of issues, from security to social and economic development.

But it does not contain specific dollar commitments by the United States, which has led some critics to dismiss it as less a blueprint than a symbolic gesture.

To keep a wrap on Mr. Obama's travels, the White House resorted to some legerdemain, putting out a schedule for Tuesday that said the president would take part in an Oval Office meeting with advisers in the morning, then meet there with Mr. Biden and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta on Tuesday afternoon.

Instead, late on Monday, Mr. Obama slipped out of the White House and traveled to Joint Base Andrews. At midnight, Air Force One, its lights switched off and window shades drawn, rolled out from behind a hangar. A small group of reporters, including one from The New York Times, were allowed to accompany the president, after they agreed not to report on his whereabouts until his helicopter landed in Kabul.",2012-05-02,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.780, NEU: 0.216, NEG: 0.004})",0.7801766991615295,0.21613408625125885,0.0036892301868647337,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.870, POS: 0.106, NEG: 0.024})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.748, POS: 0.245, NEG: 0.007})",0.10592769086360931,0.8695964217185974,0.024475866928696632,0.24534140527248383,0.7480786442756653,0.006580034736543894
44,44,2012-05-10-SameSexMarriage.txt,"Wellâyou know, I have to tell you, as I've said, I'veâI've been going through an evolution on this issue. I've always been adamant thatâgay and lesbianâAmericans should be treated fairly and equally. And that's why in addition to everything we've done in this administration, rolling back Don't Ask, Don't Tellâso thatâyou know, outstanding Americans can serve our country. Whether it's no longer defending the Defense Against Marriage Act, whichâtried to federalizeâwhat is historically been state law.

I've stood on the side of broader equality forâthe L.G.B.T. community. And I had hesitated on gay marriageâin part, because I thought civil unions would be sufficient. That that was something that would give people hospital visitation rights andâotherâelements that we take for granted. AndâI was sensitive to the fact thatâfor a lot of people, you know, the word marriage was something that evokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs, and so forth.

But I have to tell you that over the course ofâseveral years, as I talk to friends and family and neighbors. When I think aboutâmembers of my own staff who are incredibly committed, in monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together. When I think aboutâthose soldiers or airmen or marines orâsailors who are out there fighting on my behalfâand yet, feel constrained, even now that Don't Ask, Don't Tell is gone, becauseâthey're not able toâcommit themselves in a marriage.

At a certain point, I've just concluded thatâfor me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm thatâI think same-sex couples should be able to get married. NowâI have to tell you that part of my hesitation on this has also been I didn't want to nationalize the issue. There's a tendency when I weigh in to think suddenly it becomes political and it becomes polarized.

And what you're seeing is, I think, states working through this issueâin fits and starts, all across the country. Different communities are arriving at different conclusions, at different times. And I think that's a healthy process and a healthy debate. And I continue to believe that this is an issue that is gonna be worked out at the local level, because historically, this has not been a federal issue, what's recognized as a marriage.

what I'm saying is is that different states are coming to different conclusions. But this debate is taking placeâat a local level. And I think the whole country is evolving and changing. Andâyou know, one of the things that I'd like to see isâthat a conversation continue in a respectful way.

I think it's important to recognize thatâfolksâwhoâfeel very strongly that marriage should be defined narrowly asâbetween a man and a womanâmany of them are not coming at it from a mean-spirited perspective. They're coming at it because they care about families. Andâtheyâthey have a different understanding, in terms ofâyou know, what the word ""marriage"" should mean. And Iâa bunch of 'em are friends of mineâyou know, pastors andâyou know, people whoâI deeply respect.

Absolutely. Butâbut I think it's important for meâto say to them that as much as I respect 'em, as much as I understand where they're comin' fromâwhen I meet gay and lesbian couples, when I meet same-sex couples, and I seeâhow caring they are, how much love they have in their heartsâhow they're takin' care of their kids. When I hear from them the pain they feel that somehow they are still consideredâless than full citizens when it comes toâtheir legal rightsâthenâfor me, I think itâit just has tipped the scales in that direction.

Andâyou know, one of the things that you see inâa state like New York thatâended upâlegalizing same-sex marriagesâwas I thought they did a good job in engaging the religious community. Making it absolutely clear that what we're talking about are civil marriages and civil laws.

That they're respectful of religious liberty, thatâyou know, churches and other faith institutionsâare still gonna be able to make determinations about what they're sacraments areâwhat they recognize. But from the perspective ofâof the law and perspective of the stateâI think it's importantâto say that in this country we've always been aboutâfairness. Andâand treatin' everybodyâas equals. Or at least that's been our aspiration. And I thinkâthat applies here, as well.

I would. Andâand that'sâthat's part of theâthe evolution that I went through. I asked myselfâright after that New York vote took place, if I had been a state senator, which I was for a timeâhow would I have voted? And I had to admit to myself, ""You know what? I think thatâI would have voted yes."" It would have been hard for me, knowingâall the friends and familyâthatâare gays or lesbians, that for me to say to them, you know, ""I voted to oppose you havingâthe same kind of rightsâand responsibilitiesâthat I have.""

Andâyou know, it's interesting. Some of this is also generational. You know, when I go to college campuses, sometimes I talk to college Republicans who think thatâI have terrible policies on theâthe economy or on foreign policy. But are very clear that when it comes to same-sex equality or, you knowâsexual orientation that they believe in equality. They're much more comfortable with it.

You know, Malia and Sasha, they've got friends whose parents are same-sex couples. And Iâyou know, there have been times where Michelle and I have been sittin' around the dinner table. And we've been talkin' andâabout their friends and their parents. And Malia and Sasha wouldâit wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their friends' parents would be treated differently. It doesn't make sense to them. Andâand franklyâthat's the kind of thing that promptsâa change of perspective. You know, not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treatedâdifferently, when it comes toâthe eyes of the law.

Well, Iâyou know, my Justice Department has alreadyâsaid that it is not gonna defendâthe Defense Against Marriage Act. That we consider that a violation of equal protection clause. And I agree with them on that. You know? I helped to prompt thatâthat move on the part of the Justice Department.

Part of the reason that I thought it was importantâto speak to this issue was the fact thatâyou know, I've got an opponent onâon the other side in the upcoming presidential election, who wants toâre-federalize the issue andâinstitute a constitutional amendmentâthat would prohibit gay marriage. And, you know, I think it is a mistake toâtry to make what has traditionally been a state issue into a national issue.

I think thatâyou know, the winds of change are happening. They're not blowin'âwith the same force in every state. But I think that what you're gonna see is statesâcoming toâthe realization that ifâif a soldier can fight for us, if a police officer can protect our neighborhoodsâif a fire fighter is expected to go into a burning buildingâto save our possessions or our kids. The notion that after they were done with that, that we'd say to them, ""Oh but by the way, we're gonna treat you differently. That you may not be able toâenjoyâtheâthe ability ofâof passing onâwhat you have to your loved one, if youâif you die. The notion that somehow ifâif you get sick, your loved one might have trouble visiting you in a hospital.""

You know, I think that as more and more folks think about it, they're gonna say, you know, ""That's not who we are."" And as I said, I want toâI want to emphasizeâthatâI've got a lot of friendsâon the other side of this issue. You know, I'm sure they'll be callin' me up andâand I respect them. And I understand their perspective, in part, becauseâtheir impulse is the right one. Which is they want toâthey want to preserve and strengthen families.

And I think they're concerned aboutâwon't you see families breaking down. It's just thatâmaybe they haven't had the experience that I have had in seeing same-sex couples, who are as committed, as monogamous, as responsibleâas loving of a group of parents asâanyâheterosexual couple that I know. And in some cases, more so.

And, you knowâif you look at the underlying values that we care so deeply about when we describe family, commitment, responsibility, lookin' after one anotherâyou know, teachingâour kids toâto be responsible citizens andâcaring for one anotherâI actually think thatâyou know, it's consistent with our best and in some cases our most conservative values, sort of the foundation of whatâmade this country great.
","President Barack Obama said Wednesday he supported gay marriage, reversing his position on a controversial social issue just six months before the November election and adopting a stance fraught with uncertain political implications.

Mr. Obama had been under intense pressure this week to lay out a clear stance on same-sex marriage after Vice President Joe Biden and other top advisers endorsed it. Mr. Obama said that after years of lengthy discussions with friends and family, including his wife and two young daughters, he now ""personally"" believes gays and lesbians should have the right to marry.

""I've been going through an evolution on this issue. I've always been adamant that gay and lesbian Americans should be treated fairly and equally,"" Mr. Obama said in a television interview with ABC. ""At a certain point I've just concluded that, for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.""

Mr. Obama is the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support gay marriage. His endorsement is largely a symbolic moment for a country that is actively wrestling with the issue.

While the president opposes the federal Defense of Marriage law that defines marriage as a union of a man and a woman, he doesn't plan to pursue new U.S. policy on gay marriage, aides said, because he believes states should decide the issue.

Mr. Obama was against same-sex marriage as a candidate in 2008 but supported civil unions. In the fall of 2010, he said his views on gay marriage were ""evolving,"" a stance widely interpreted as moving toward an endorsement. Asked numerous times afterward whether his position had changed, the president deflected the question and pointed to his record on other gay-rights issues.

On Wednesday, he explained, ""I had hesitated on gay marriage, in part because I thought civil unions would be sufficient. . . And I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people the word 'marriage' was something that invokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs and so forth.""

He said his position was influenced by gay members of the military and his staff who are raising children together in monogamous relationships.

Mr. Obama informed a handful of top aides earlier this year he had decided to publicly support gay marriage before the Democratic National Convention in September, senior administration officials said. Mr. Biden's public support, in a TV interview Sunday, and the 72 hours of fallout that came afterward sped up the president's timetable, these officials said.

Mr. Obama's position puts him squarely at odds with that of Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr. Romney has said he believes marriage should be between a man and a woman. He also opposes civil unions and has said he would back a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.

Asked Wednesday about Mr. Obama's gay-marriage endorsement while campaigning in Oklahoma, Mr. Romney acknowledged that it is a ""very tender and sensitive topic."" He said states are able to make decisions about domestic-partnership benefits, including hospital-visitation rights. ""But my view is that marriage, itself, is a relationship between a man and a woman and that's my own preference,"" he said.

Polls show Americans' views on gay marriage are shifting faster than for many other hot-button social issues, with 49% in favor, according to a March Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, up from 41% in 2009. Some 40% of Americans oppose gay marriage, according to the poll.

Other surveys show similar levels of backing for same sex-marriage, but some show opposition to have nearly equal support. In a recent Gallup survey, 50% approved of gay marriage, while 48% said they opposed it. But polls consistently show rising support in recent years.

Voters have enacted constitutional bans on gay marriage in a number of battleground states that will decide the 2012 election, among them Ohio and Florida. Mr. Obama's Wednesday announcement came a day after residents in North Carolina, a state the president hopes to win in November, voted overwhelmingly in favor of a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman.

North Carolina is also hosting the Democratic National Convention, where Democrats were set to battle over whether to make gay marriage rights a plank of their party's official platform.

The issue holds potential perils for conservative Democrats, and benefits for Mr. Romney.

Ralph Reed, founder and chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a social conservative group, said Mr. Obama's gay-marriage switch would fire up the GOP's conservative base. ""This is an unanticipated gift to the Romney campaign. It is certain to fuel a record turnout of voters of faith to the polls this November,"" he said.

""Just before an election, you're going to rile up the right-wing base, there's no question about it,"" said Peter Fenn, a Democratic consultant. ""It will hurt in rural areas and the West, and you may take some fallout in the black community.""

Wading into the gay-marriage issue now poses potential risks and rewards for Mr. Obama among different types of voters who helped him win the White House in 2008.

The move could energize young voters, who support gay marriage by a wide margin -- 57% of 18- to 34-year-olds in the Journal poll were in favor.

But a major question is how his changed stance will be received by African-American voters, who are central to Mr. Obama's re-election strategy. Support for same-sex marriage had been relatively low among blacks, but views have evolved: The Journal poll showed African-American support for gay marriage rose to 50% in March from 32% in 2009.

Senior administration officials said Wednesday they are unsure whether Mr. Obama's new position would produce a net gain or loss in support, or whether the support and opposition for it would balance each other out.","Before President Obama left the White House on Tuesday morning to fly to an event in Albany, several aides intercepted him in the Oval Office. Within minutes it was decided: the president would endorse same-sex marriage on Wednesday, completing a wrenching personal transformation on the issue.

As described by several aides, that quick decision and his subsequent announcement in a hastily scheduled network television interview were thrust on the White House by 48 hours of frenzied will-he-or-won't-he speculation after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. all but forced the president's hand by embracing the idea of same-sex unions in a Sunday talk show interview.

Advisers say now that Mr. Obama had intended since early this year to define his position sometime before Democrats nominate him for re-election in September. Yet many of the president's allies believed he would not do so, trusting instead in his strong support from gay voters for having ended a ban on openly gay people in the military and disavowing a federal law defining marriage as between a man and a woman.

Such caution was understandable, the allies said, given the unpredictable fallout the president would face by taking a clear stand on one of the most contentious and politically charged social issues of the day, before what is likely to be a close election. Mr. Obama's closest advisers say only the timing was in question. Mr. Biden's unexpected remarks undoubtedly accelerated the timetable.

Initially Mr. Obama and his aides expected that the moment would be Monday, when the president was scheduled to be on ""The View,"" the ABC daytime talk show, which is popular with women. Certainly, they thought, he would be asked his position on same-sex marriage by one of the show's hosts, who include Barbara Walters and Whoopi Goldberg.

Yet the pressure had become too great to wait until then, his aides told him; on Monday, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, was pummeled with questions from skeptical reporters about Mr. Obama's stance. After the Tuesday morning meeting, Dan Pfeiffer, the president's communications director, contacted ABC and offered a wide-ranging interview with the president for the following day.

And so it was that Mr. Obama on Wednesday afternoon sat down in the White House with ABC's Robin Roberts and made news, after nearly two years of saying that his views on same-sex marriage were ""evolving.""

""At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,"" Mr. Obama said.

Long a proponent of civil unions, Mr. Obama said his views had changed in part because of prodding by friends who are gay and by conversations with his wife and daughters.

""I had hesitated on gay marriage in part because I thought that civil unions would be sufficient,"" Mr. Obama said. ""I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, the word marriage was something that invokes very powerful traditions and religious beliefs.""

Mr. Obama also invoked his Christian faith in explaining his decision.

""The thing at root that we think about is, not only Christ sacrificing himself on our behalf, but it's also the golden rule -- you know, treat others the way you would want to be treated,"" he said. ""And I think that's what we try to impart to our kids, and that's what motivates me as president.""

Reaction to Mr. Obama's announcement was largely predictable -- including immediate opposition from his presumptive Republican rival, Mitt Romney -- yet people on both sides of the issue pointed to the historical significance of a president endorsing marriage between people of the same sex. It was a Democrat, Bill Clinton, who signed the Defense of Marriage Act, defining marriage as between a man and a woman, which the Obama administration last year decided not to enforce in the courts.

While Mr. Obama's announcement was significant from a symbolic standpoint, more important as a practical matter were Mr. Obama's decision not to enforce the marriage act and his successful push in 2010 to repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" law that prohibited openly gay men and lesbians from serving in the military. For that reason, gay rights groups had been largely enthusiastic about his re-election campaign while being pragmatically resigned to his not publicly supporting same-sex marriage before the election.

Mr. Obama's announcement has little substantive impact -- as an aide said, ""It's not like we're trying to pass legislation.""

But the political impact is a wild card, even Obama advisers acknowledged, and it came one day after voters in North Carolina -- the site of the Democratic Party's nominating convention -- supported a ban on same-sex marriage. But while the president has now injected a volatile social issue into the campaign debate, both sides say the election still is all but certain to turn on the economy.

Public support for same-sex marriage is growing at a pace that surprises even pollsters as older generations of voters who tend to be strongly opposed are supplanted by younger ones who are just as strongly in favor. Same-sex couples are featured in some of the most popular shows on television.

Yet opponents include white working-class voters, among whom Mr. Obama has long had weak support, and many African-Americans, led by influential ministers in their churches, whose support is critical to Mr. Obama in swing states like Virginia and North Carolina. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, one of the first openly gay members of Congress, said he told the White House months ago that it should not worry about the politics.

""This country is moving, and what's interesting is every time somebody does something that's supportive of our rights, it turns out to be (a) popular and (b) not very controversial,"" he said in a telephone interview.

Many Americans already assumed Mr. Obama supported same-sex marriage, Mr. Frank said, adding, ""Politically, it's kind of a nonevent.""

Obama strategists had rejected the idea of announcing the president's support during a fund-raiser or at a speech to a gay rights group, because, as one Democrat close to the White House put it, that would ""look like pandering.""

Then last Friday, Mr. Biden taped his interview for NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" shown on Sunday morning. Afterward, Mr. Biden's aides circulated a transcript around the West Wing, with the gay marriage remarks highlighted in yellow. A flurry of e-mails ensued about how Mr. Biden's office should explain it once the interview was broadcast.

The news media attention escalated on Monday when Mr. Obama's education secretary, Arne Duncan, acknowledged in a television interview that he also supported same-sex marriage. Editorialists, columnists and bloggers criticized Mr. Obama as appearing calculating by his continued ambivalence.

An administration official, who like others did not want to be named discussing internal White House deliberations, said that until this week, the one certainty was for Mr. Obama to take his stand before September to avoid a convention fight. ""It's not helpful to go down there and have a big conflagration about including this in the platform,"" the official said.

But several events loomed that would also force attention on the issue, leaving Mr. Obama vulnerable to continued criticism.

On Thursday, Mr. Obama is to visit the Los Angeles home of the actor George Clooney for a campaign fund-raiser expected to raise about $12 million, much of it from Hollywood people active in the gay rights cause.

Mr. Obama is scheduled to give the commencement address next week at Barnard College in New York City, where he will receive a medal along with Evan Wolfson, the founder and president of Freedom to Marry, a leading advocate for same-sex unions. Mr. Wolfson, who had written that he would ""whisper in the president's ear"" to support same-sex marriage, said in an interview on Wednesday, ""I'm going to shout, 'Thank you!' ""

Also on Monday, Mr. Obama is to speak at a campaign fund-raiser for gay rights supporters. And on June 6, he is to return to Los Angeles to speak at a gala benefiting the gay, bisexual and transgender community.",2012-05-10,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.894, POS: 0.094, NEG: 0.012})",0.09377755224704742,0.8943027257919312,0.01191964652389288,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.728, POS: 0.264, NEG: 0.008})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.926, POS: 0.061, NEG: 0.012})",0.2643304765224457,0.7280076146125793,0.007661966606974602,0.06130688264966011,0.9263767004013062,0.012316306121647358
45,45,2012-06-29-SupremeCourtHealthCare.txt,"Good afternoon.  Earlier today, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act -- the name of the health care reform we passed two years ago.  In doing so, they've reaffirmed a fundamental principle that here in America -- in the wealthiest nation on Earth â no illness or accident should lead to any familyâs financial ruin. 

I know there will be a lot of discussion today about the politics of all this, about who won and who lost.  Thatâs how these things tend to be viewed here in Washington.  But that discussion completely misses the point.  Whatever the politics, todayâs decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives will be more secure because of this law and the Supreme Courtâs decision to uphold it.

And because this law has a direct impact on so many Americans, I want to take this opportunity to talk about exactly what it means for you. 

First, if youâre one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance -- this law will only make it more secure and more affordable.  Insurance companies can no longer impose lifetime limits on the amount of care you receive.  They can no longer discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.  They can no longer drop your coverage if you get sick.  They can no longer jack up your premiums without reason.  They are required to provide free preventive care like check-ups and mammograms -- a provision that's already helped 54 million Americans with private insurance.  And by this August, nearly 13 million of you will receive a rebate from your insurance company because it spent too much on things like administrative costs and CEO bonuses, and not enough on your health care. 

Thereâs more.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, young adults under the age of 26 are able to stay on their parent's health care plans -- a provision that's already helped 6 million young Americans.  And because of the Affordable Care Act, seniors receive a discount on their prescription drugs -- a discount that's already saved more than 5 million seniors on Medicare about $600 each.

All of this is happening because of the Affordable Care Act. These provisions provide common-sense protections for middle class families, and they enjoy broad popular support.  And thanks to todayâs decision, all of these benefits and protections will continue for Americans who already have health insurance.   

Now, if youâre one of the 30 million Americans who donât yet have health insurance, starting in 2014 this law will offer you an array of quality, affordable, private health insurance plans to choose from.  Each state will take the lead in designing their own menu of options, and if states can come up with even better ways of covering more people at the same quality and cost, this law allows them to do that, too.  And Iâve asked Congress to help speed up that process, and give states this flexibility in year one. 

Once states set up these health insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against any American with a preexisting health condition.  They wonât be able to charge you more just because youâre a woman.  They wonât be able to bill you into bankruptcy. If youâre sick, youâll finally have the same chance to get quality, affordable health care as everyone else.  And if you canât afford the premiums, you'll receive a credit that helps pay for it. 

Today, the Supreme Court also upheld the principle that people who can afford health insurance should take the responsibility to buy health insurance.  This is important for two reasons. 

First, when uninsured people who can afford coverage get sick, and show up at the emergency room for care, the rest of us end up paying for their care in the form of higher premiums. 

And second, if you ask insurance companies to cover people with preexisting conditions, but donât require people who can afford it to buy their own insurance, some folks might wait until theyâre sick to buy the care they need -- which would also drive up everybody elseâs premiums.

Thatâs why, even though I knew it wouldnât be politically popular, and resisted the idea when I ran for this office, we ultimately included a provision in the Affordable Care Act that people who can afford to buy health insurance should take the responsibility to do so.  In fact, this idea has enjoyed support from members of both parties, including the current Republican nominee for President.

Still, I know the debate over this law has been divisive.  I respect the very real concerns that millions of Americans have shared.  And I know a lot of coverage through this health care debate has focused on what it means politically. 

Well, it should be pretty clear by now that I didnât do this because it was good politics.  I did it because I believed it was good for the country.  I did it because I believed it was good for the American people.

Thereâs a framed letter that hangs in my office right now.  It was sent to me during the health care debate by a woman named Natoma Canfield.  For years and years, Natoma did everything right.  She bought health insurance.  She paid her premiums on time.  But 18 years ago, Natoma was diagnosed with cancer.  And even though sheâd been cancer-free for more than a decade, her insurance company kept jacking up her rates, year after year.  And despite her desire to keep her coverage -- despite her fears that she would get sick again -- she had to surrender her health insurance, and was forced to hang her fortunes on chance. 

I carried Natomaâs story with me every day of the fight to pass this law.  It reminded me of all the Americans, all across the country, who have had to worry not only about getting sick, but about the cost of getting well. 

Natoma is well today.  And because of this law, there are other Americans -- other sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers -- who will not have to hang their fortunes on chance.  These are the Americans for whom we passed this law. 

The highest Court in the land has now spoken.  We will continue to implement this law.  And we'll work together to improve on it where we can.  But what we wonât do -- what the country canât afford to do -- is refight the political battles of two years ago, or go back to the way things were. 

With todayâs announcement, itâs time for us to move forward -- to implement and, where necessary, improve on this law.  And now is the time to keep our focus on the most urgent challenge of our time:  putting people back to work, paying down our debt, and building an economy where people can have confidence that if they work hard, they can get ahead. 

But today, Iâm as confident as ever that when we look back five years from now, or 10 years from now, or 20 years from now, weâll be better off because we had the courage to pass this law and keep moving forward. 

Thank you.  God bless you, and God bless America.
","Chief Justice John Roberts joined the Supreme Court's four liberals Thursday to uphold the linchpin of President Barack Obama's plan to expand health coverage to nearly all Americans, a surprise conclusion to a constitutional showdown.

The ruling clears the way for the biggest revamp of the U.S. health-care system since the 1960s -- and sets the stage for a renewed political fight over its merits.

By a 5-4 vote, the court held the law's mandate requiring Americans to carry health insurance or pay a penalty valid under Congress's constitutional authority to levy taxes. The financial penalty for failing to carry insurance possesses ""the essential feature of any tax,"" producing revenue for the government, Chief Justice Roberts wrote.

But the court gave a consolation prize to the 26 largely Republican-led states that challenged the law -- and opened a new door to their resistance. It ruled that the U.S. government couldn't expel states from Medicaid if they refused to go along with the expanded eligibility for the federal-state health program that is part of the health law.

The decision, tensely awaited for months, proved a vast relief to Democrats and Mr. Obama.

Speaking at the White House, the president retold the story of a woman with cancer who had to go without insurance and said, ""Because of this law, there are other Americans . . . who will not have to hang their fortunes on chance. These are the Americans for whom we passed this law.""

But the decision also handed Republicans a sharper message for the fall campaign: They said they would tell Americans who dislike ""Obamacare"" that electing GOP candidates is the only way to repeal it. What's more, by calling the insurance penalty the legal equivalent of a tax, the court allows Republicans to accuse the president of raising taxes for some.

""This is now a time for the American people to make a choice,"" said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. ""You can choose whether you want to have a larger and larger government.""

The ruling means that the law's reordering of the $2.7 trillion health industry will move forward mostly as planned, with implications affecting every hospital, doctor, health insurer and drug maker in the nation. About 30 million more Americans are expected to gain coverage, although the Medicaid change could lower that.

Altogether, the ruling is both a political and a constitutional landmark. It bestows a measure of validation on President Obama's legislative achievement after two years of relentless attacks and casts a new light on Chief Justice Roberts -- a George W. Bush appointee whom some Democrats had pegged as a Republican partisan -- reaching across the ideological divide even while reinforcing some long-standing conservative principles.

Not only did the chief justice revive states' rights in the Medicaid ruling, he also rejected the principal legal basis the Obama administration invoked to justify the health-care overhaul, Congress's constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce. Since the New Deal of the 1930s, the Supreme Court had only twice found Congress exceeded its commerce authority, and never for a program designed to expand the social safety net.

Congress has invoked its commerce power to pass a vast array of laws, from the Endangered Species Act to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, often over conservative complaints that such regulation exceeded the intent of the Constitution's framers. On Thursday, however, Chief Justice Roberts drew a firm limit on the commerce power, writing that if accepted as the basis of the individual insurance mandate, federal authority would be virtually unlimited.

""The Commerce Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual from cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably engage in particular transactions,"" the chief justice wrote. Four dissenting conservatives, Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, agreed.

But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said the Commerce Clause was enough to justify the law, which she said ""addresses the very sort of interstate problem that made the commerce power essential in our federal system.""

Chief Justice Roberts added that the penalty for failing to carry insurance met the criteria for a tax. Because of the court's duty to defer to the elected branches when possible, the mandate must be upheld, he wrote.

Neither the label of ""penalty"" nor the fact it was intended to influence behavior mattered, he wrote. The penalty functioned like a tax -- and other taxes, such as those on cigarettes, are enacted principally to create incentives rather than raise revenue, he said.

Although the Obama administration always asserted the penalty was valid under the federal taxing power, until Thursday no court had fully accepted that.

It was a day of surprises at the court, including the role of Chief Justice Roberts as the deciding vote instead of the usual swing voter, Justice Kennedy. Reading a joint dissent from the bench, Justice Kennedy said the majority engaged in ""vast judicial overreaching"" and decided ""to save a statute Congress did not write.""

Before the decision was read, the packed courtroom was silent. The chief began by rejecting Congress's power to legislate the mandate under the Commerce Clause. Many in the audience thought he was en route to striking down the law.

Then, about halfway through his 20-minute recitation, Chief Justice Roberts turned to Congress's taxing power. Some in the audience expressed surprise as listeners realized the law would survive.","The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld President Obama's health care overhaul law, saying its requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty was authorized by Congress's power to levy taxes. The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joining the court's four more liberal members.

The decision was a victory for Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats, affirming the central legislative achievement of Mr. Obama's presidency.

""The Affordable Care Act's requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax,"" Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. ""Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.""

At the same time, the court rejected the argument that the administration had pressed most vigorously in support of the law, that its individual mandate was justified by Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. The vote was again 5 to 4, but in this instance Chief Justice Roberts and the court's four more conservative members were in agreement.

The court also substantially limited the law's expansion of Medicaid, the joint federal-state program that provides health care to poor and disabled people. Seven justices agreed that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority by coercing states into participating in the expansion by threatening them with the loss of existing federal payments.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who had been thought to be the administration's best hope to provide a fifth vote to uphold the law, joined three more conservative members in an unusual jointly written dissent that said the court should have struck down the entire law. The majority's approach, he said from the bench, ""amounts to a vast judicial overreaching.""

The court's ruling was the most significant federalism decision since the New Deal and the most closely watched case since Bush v. Gore in 2000. It was a crucial milestone for the law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, allowing almost all -- and perhaps, in the end, all -- of its far-reaching changes to roll forward.

Mr. Obama welcomed the court's decision on the health care law, which has inspired fierce protests, legal challenges and vows of repeal since it was passed. ""Whatever the politics, today's decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives are more secure because of this law,"" he said at the White House.

Republicans, though, used the occasion to attack it again.

""Obamacare was bad policy yesterday; it's bad policy today,"" Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in remarks near the Capitol. ""Obamacare was bad law yesterday; it's bad law today."" He, like Congressional Republicans, renewed his pledge to undo the law.

The historic decision, coming after three days of lively oral arguments in March and in the midst of a presidential campaign, drew intense attention across the nation. Outside the court, more than 1,000 people gathered -- packing the sidewalk, playing music, chanting slogans -- and a loud cheer went up as word spread that the law had been largely upheld. Chants of ""Yes we can!"" rang out, but the ruling also provoked disappointment among Tea Party supporters.

In Loudoun County, Va., Angela Laws, 58, the owner of a cleaning service, said she and her fiance were relieved at the news. ""We laughed, and we shouted with joy and hugged each other,"" she said, explaining that she had been unable to get insurance because of her diabetes and back problems until a provision in the health care law went into effect.

After months of uncertainty about the law's fate, the court's ruling provides some clarity -- and perhaps an alert -- to states, insurers, employers and consumers about what they are required to do by 2014, when much of the law comes into force.

The Obama administration had argued that the mandate was necessary because it allowed other provisions of the law to function: those overhauling the way insurance is sold and those preventing sick people from being denied or charged extra for insurance. The mandate's supporters had said it was necessary to ensure that not only sick people but also healthy individuals would sign up for coverage, keeping insurance premiums more affordable.

Conservatives took comfort from two parts of the decision: the new limits it placed on federal regulation of commerce and on the conditions the federal government may impose on money it gives the states.

Five justices accepted the argument that had been at the heart of the challenges brought by 26 states and other plaintiffs: that the federal government is not permitted to force individuals not engaged in commercial activities to buy services they do not want. That was a stunning victory for a theory pressed by a small band of conservative and libertarian lawyers. Most members of the legal academy view the theory as misguided,if not frivolous.

""To an economist, perhaps, there is no difference between activity and inactivity; both have measurable economic effects on commerce,"" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ""But the distinction between doing something and doing nothing would not have been lost on the framers, who were practical statesmen, not metaphysical philosophers.""

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in an opinion joined by Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, dissented on this point, calling the view ""stunningly retrogressive."" She wondered why Chief Justice Roberts had seen fit to address it at all in light of his vote to uphold the mandate under the tax power.

Akhil Reed Amar, a Yale law professor and a champion of the health care law, said that it was ""important to look at the dark cloud behind the silver lining.""

""Federal power has more restrictions on it,"" he said, referring to the new limits on regulating commerce. ""Going forward, there may even be laws on the books that have to be re-examined.""

The restrictions placed on the Medicaid expansion may also have significant ripple effects. A splintered group of justices effectively revised the law to allow states to choose between participating in the expansion while receiving additional payments or forgoing the expansion and retaining the existing payments. The law had called for an all-or-nothing choice.

The expansion had been designed to provide coverage to 17 million Americans. While some states have indicated that they will participate in the expansion, others may be resistant, leaving more people outside the safety net than the Obama administration had intended.

Although the decision did not turn on it, the back-and-forth between Justice Ginsburg's opinion for the four liberals and the joint opinion by the four conservatives -- Justice Kennedy and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. -- revisited the by-now-familiar arguments. Broccoli made a dozen appearances.

""Although an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no certainty she will ever do so,"" Justice Ginsburg wrote. ""And if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.""

The conservative dissenters responded that ""one day the failure of some of the public to purchase American cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer-fighting chemical which only that food contains, producing health care costs that are a burden on the rest of us.""

All of the justices agreed that their review of the health care law was not barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, which allows suits over some sorts of taxes only after they become due. That could have delayed the health care challenge to 2015. The conservative dissenters said that the majority could not have it both ways by calling the mandate a tax for some purposes but not others.

""That carries verbal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of sophists,"" they said.

As a general matter, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the decision in the case, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, No. 11-393, offered no endorsement of the law's wisdom.

Some decisions, the chief justice said, ""are entrusted to our nation's elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them.""

Justice Ginsburg, speaking to a crowded courtroom that sat rapt for the better part of an hour, drew a different conclusion.

46,46,2012-07-21-AuroraShooting.txt,"Let me first of all say how grateful I am for all of you being here, and how -- how much we appreciate everything that you've done. I know that there are a lot of people here who have been so engaged in the campaign, have sacrificed so much, people who've been involved back since 2007. And...so I...want all of you to know how appreciative I am. 

And I know many of you came here today for a campaign event. I was looking forward to having a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as a country and the differences between myself and my opponent in this election.

But this morning, we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways that we are united as one American family.

By now, many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver, in a town call Aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater, and dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Some of the victims are being treated at a childrenâs hospital. 

Now, weâre still gathering all the facts about what happened in Aurora, but what we do know is that the police have one suspect in custody. And the federal government stands ready to do whatever is necessary to bring whoever is responsible for this heinous crime to justice -- and we will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. 

We're going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time. And I had a chance to speak with the Mayor of Aurora as well as the Governor of Colorado to express, not just on behalf of Michelle and myself, but the entire American family, how heartbroken we are.

Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understand what leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil is senseless. It's beyond reason.

But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we do know what makes life worth living. The people we lost in Aurora loved and they were loved. They were mothers and fathers; they were husbands and wives; sisters and brothers; sons and daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the future and they had dreams that were not yet fulfilled. 

And if thereâs anything to take away from this tragedy itâs the reminder that life is very fragile. Our time here is limited and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not the small things; itâs not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives. Ultimately, itâs how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another.

Itâs -- It's what we do on a daily basis to give our lives meaning and to give our lives purpose. Thatâs what matters. At the end of the day, what weâll remember will be those we loved and what we did for others. Thatâs why weâre here.

Iâm sure that many of you who are parents here had the same reaction that I did when I heard this news. My daughters go to the movies. What if Malia and Sasha had been at the theater, as so many of our kids do every day? Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hug our girls a little tighter tonight, and Iâm sure you will do the same with your children. But for those parents who may not be so lucky, we have to embrace them and let them know we will be there for them as a nation.

So, again, I am -- I'm so grateful that all of you are here. I am...so moved by your support. But there are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection.

For -- So -- So what Iâd ask everybody to do, Iâd like us to pause in a moment of silence for the victims of this terrible tragedy, for the people who knew them and loved them, for those who are still struggling to recover, and for all the victims of less publicized acts of violence that plague our communities every single day.

So if everybody can just take a moment.

 Thank you, everybody.

I hope all of you will keep the people of Aurora in your hearts and minds today. May the Lord bring them comfort and healing in hard days to come.

I am grateful to all of you, and I hope that as a consequence of todayâs events, as -- as you leave here, you spend a little time thinking about the incredible blessings that God has given us.

Thank you very much, everybody.

God bless you.

God bless the United States of America.
","A gunman wearing a gas mask and sheathed head-to-toe in body armor opened fire in a theater packed for a midnight showing of a just-released Batman movie, killing at least 12 people and wounding 58 others.

Police in this suburb just east of Denver quickly arrested the alleged shooter, James E. Holmes, a 24-year-old graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado Denver with no known criminal history other than a speeding violation.

The rampage began around 12:38 a.m. Friday at the Century Aurora 16 movie theater, which was crowded for the first showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises.""

From the front of the theater, the shooter set off what witnesses and authorities described as tear gas or a smoke bomb. He then started firing weapons, including a semi-automatic rifle and shotgun, as the horrified crowd realized too late that the dark figure in their midst wasn't connected to the violent action movie.

""There were many, many rounds fired,"" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said at a news conference Friday, adding, ""This is a very tough day for a whole lot of people.""

Corbin Dates, a 23-year-old AT&T Inc. worker at the late-night screening, said that when he saw the theater's emergency doors swing open and a man walk inside, he thought it was some kind of movie-related stunt. Even as people screamed, he thought it was part of the show. Then he saw the man throw a gas canister into the crowd and begin firing.

""I heard the gunshots go pop, pop, pop, and I fell to the floor, crawling on the ground to try to get out,"" Mr. Dates said.

As the gunman walked along the left side of the theater, Mr. Dates said he crawled up the right side, urging frightened patrons to pretend they were dead. He made it out, but saw bodies slumped over in their movie seats as he fled.

The barrage left dozens wounded; they were taken to six hospitals, authorities said. Police initially said 14 were dead but by early Friday had confirmed 12 deaths. The last of the bodies were removed from the movie theater by 5 p.m. on Friday but the police hadn't released the names of the deceased.

Frightened families gathered at a local high school, where Faliciano Gonzalz, 53, went to try to find information about his 17-year-old son, Willy, who was planning to go to the movies and hadn't been heard from since 6 p.m. Thursday.

The Arapahoe County, Colo., Medical Examiner's office confirmed that Jessica Ghawi, 24, an aspiring sportswriter from Texas, was among the deceased. Ms. Ghawi was on the scene of another deadly incident last month in Toronto, Canada, and blogged about walking out of a food court at a mall there moments before a shooting that left two dead and half a dozen injured.

In Aurora, more than two dozen officers rushed to the theater within minutes of the shootings. They quickly arrested Mr. Holmes in a parking lot behind the movie house, next to his white Hyundai. He did not resist, they said. Police believe he acted alone.

He ""was dressed all in black, he was wearing a ballistic helmet, a tactical ballistic vest, ballistic leggings, a throat protector and a groin protector and a gas mask, and black tactical gloves,"" said Mr. Oates, the police chief.

Mr. Holmes had purchased two firearms at a Bass Pro Shop in Denver, the company said Friday.

Mr. Oates said Friday night that the suspect bought four guns over the past 60 days, and over the Internet bought 3,000 rounds for an assault rifle, 3,000 rounds for Glock handguns and about 300 shotgun rounds. The suspect also had a 100-round drum-style magazine for the assault rifle that would have allowed him to fire 50 to 60 rounds a minute.

Aurora, Colo., Police Chief Dan Oates indicated Mr. Holmes might have hidden explosives in his car or apartment. None were found in the vehicle, but a robot that police sent into his apartment found what looked like explosive devices. The presence of what appeared to be tripwires and ammunition prompted the police to wait until Saturday to try to enter the apartment. Residents of the building, and four others nearby, were being sheltered in a high school.

Neighbors at the apartment complex said electronic music suddenly started blaring shortly after midnight Thursday from Mr. Holmes's apartment, at the top floor of an old, red-brick building. The loud music, playing on an endless loop, startled Kaitlyn Fonzi, a 20-year-old biology student who lived directly below and was preparing to go to sleep. She assumed her neighbor was having a party and went upstairs to investigate.

Ms. Fonzi said she knocked loudly, but no one answered. The door rattled as if it were unlocked, and she considered going in but noticed something odd: There were no sounds beyond the booming beat.

She called the police nonemergency line to complain about the noise, she said. Two hours later, she was awakened by a SWAT team, in riot gear and carrying assault rifles, who evacuated all the residents.

The mass shooting is the worst in the U.S. since a gunman killed 32 people and then took his own life in 2007 at Virginia Tech. The Aurora incident was about 16 miles from Columbine High School, where two students went on a shooting spree in April 1999, killing 13 people and wounding more than 20 others before committing suicide.

Mr. Holmes is set to appear in court Monday. Police have obtained a court order sealing search warrants, affidavits and other information in the case.

Neighbors said Mr. Holmes spent at least some of his childhood in a two-story, cream-colored house with a Spanish tile roof in an upper-middle-class San Diego neighborhood.

He graduated in 2006 from Westview High School, a public school in the San Diego area, school officials said. He then went on to study neuroscience at the University of California, Riverside, where he received a bachelor's degree in science and graduated with honors in 2010.

""Academically, he was at the top of the top,"" said Timothy White, chancellor of UC Riverside.

Family members couldn't be reached Friday, but they released a statement through San Diego police expressing condolences. ""Our hearts go out to those who are involved in this tragedy and to the family and friends involved,"" the statement said.

The University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, roughly a mile from the movie theater, received 21 patients, nine of them in critical condition, said a spokeswoman, who said the ages of the injured ranged from three months to 45 years old.

""It is an absolutely horrifying scene,"" said Comilla Sasson, an attending physician who was working in the emergency room at the hospital. She said victims had arrived in private vehicles as well as ambulances, many with severe gunshot wounds.

Military members were among the casualties. The Defense Department said that two airmen and one sailor were injured, and one sailor, known to have been at the theater that evening, was unaccounted for.

President Barack Obama, who cut short a campaign trip in Florida, said in a statement that he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the shootings and urged citizens to come together as ""one American family"" to support those affected. Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney issued a statement calling the shooting ""senseless violence.""","Anticipation built in the packed, darkened movie theater. Life and its cares began to recede.

Then, just after midnight on Friday, fantasy became nightmare, and a place of escape became a trap, when a man strode to the front in a multiplex near Denver and opened fire. At least 12 people were killed and 58 wounded, with witnesses describing a scene of claustrophobia, panic and blood. Minutes later, the police arrested James Holmes, 24, in the theater's parking lot.

""It was just chaos. You started hearing screaming. You looked up and people were falling. It was like a dream,"" said Jamie Rohrs, 25, who was there with his fiancee, cradling his 4-month-old son, Ethan, in his arms as the movie began. It was the midnight premiere of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" the latest Batman sequel, at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, about 10 miles from downtown Denver.

Mr. Rohrs jumped between the seats for cover, still holding the baby. He stumbled and crawled trying to figure out what to do, clutching his son to his chest as he went. ""Do I run out the door? Is he going to shoot the baby? What am I to do?"" Mr. Rohrs said, his voice quavering. But he, his fiancee and the baby eventually made it out.

And so once again, with a squeeze of a trigger, just 20 miles from Columbine High School, scene of the 1999 student massacre, the nation was plunged into another debate about guns and violence.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who has waged a national campaign for stricter gun laws, offered a political challenge. ""Maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it,"" Mr. Bloomberg said during his weekly radio program, ""because this is obviously a problem across the country.""

Luke O'Dell of the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, a Colorado group on the other side of the debate over gun control, took a nearly opposite view. ""Potentially, if there had been a law-abiding citizen who had been able to carry in the theater, it's possible the death toll would have been less.""

Some survivors thought at first they were witnessing a promotional stunt. The gunman, wearing what Aurora Police Department officials described as nearly head-to-toe ""ballistic gear,"" including a throat protector and leggings, plus a gas mask and a long black coat, came in through a parking lot exit door near the screen of Theater 9.

""He walked in so casually,"" said a witness, Jordan Crofter, 19, a Batman fan who had gone with a group of friends and had a seat in the front row. The gunman, still perhaps regarded by some as a performer, then released two devices down the theater aisles emitting what the police said was smoke or some sort of irritant.

Witnesses told the police that Mr. Holmes said something to the effect of ""I am the Joker,"" according to a federal law enforcement official, and that his hair had been dyed or he was wearing a wig. Then, as people began to rise from their seats in confusion or anxiety, he began to shoot. The gunman paused at least once, several witnesses said, perhaps to reload, and continued firing.

Mr. Holmes was detained by the police soon afterward, standing by his white Hyundai. He was identified by the authorities as a former Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado in Denver, and an honors graduate in neuroscience from the University of California, Riverside. He had in the car an AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington 12-gauge shotgun, and a .40 caliber Glock handgun, said Chief Dan Oates of the Aurora police, and all three were believed to have been used inside the theater. Another Glock .40 caliber handgun was recovered inside the theater. Chief Oates said that ""many, many"" rounds were fired, but that there was no count so far.

In the last 60 days Mr. Holmes had purchased four guns at local gun shops, Chief Oates said. And through the Internet, he bought more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition: more than 3,000 rounds for the assault rifle, 3,000 rounds of .40 caliber ammunition for the two Glocks, and 300 rounds for the 12-gauge shotgun. The guns were all bought legally, a federal law enforcement official said.

Mr. Holmes also purchased online multiple magazines for the assault rifle, including one 100-round drum magazine. ""With that drum magazine, he could have gotten off 50, 60 rounds, even if it was semiautomatic, within one minute,"" Chief Oates said.

The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has given information on where and when the guns were purchased to the police in Aurora.

After the chaos -- the evacuation, the rush of 911 calls beginning at 12:39 a.m., the mass casualties rushed to area hospitals, the images that witnesses described to authorities of dead or dying friends or loved ones left inside -- the emerging details got more mysterious and in some ways more horrifying still.

""Our investigation determined his apartment is booby trapped with various incendiary and chemical devices and apparent trip wires,"" Chief Oates said around midday Friday. ""We have an active and difficult scene. It may be resolved in hours or days. We simply don't know how we're going to handle that."" Federal law enforcement officials said that the apartment had been so extensively booby-trapped that the devices could not be safely defused and that a robot would be sent to trigger them. Late Friday, the dozens of residents in five apartment buildings in the area remained evacuated.

""It is a very vexing problem how to enter that apartment safely,"" Chief Oates said. ""Personally I've never seen anything like what the pictures show us is in there. I'm a layman when it comes to bomb stuff. I see an awful lot of wires. Trip wires. Jars full of ammunition. Jars full of liquid. Some things that look like mortar rounds. We have a lot of challenges to get in there safely.""

In the suspect's neighborhood of low-slung, red-brick apartment buildings and dusty lots, not far from Children's Hospital Colorado, where some of the victims were taken, neighbors shook their heads in disbelief as the police and bomb squad vehicles cordoned off the area.

""I think this is a lot like Columbine,"" said Jennifer Evans, who lives near Mr. Holmes's apartment. ""This is crazy.""

At one point, as shirtless children played in an overgrown front yard and day laborers stared in disbelief, firefighters in a hook and ladder truck smashed a window in the third story of the building where the police said Mr. Holmes resided.

Whether a violent movie had inspired violence in real life, or was merely the coincidental setting, police authorities in some other cities, including New York, said they were taking no chances and had increased security at theaters showing the movie.

In Paris, Warner Bros. canceled a red-carpet premiere of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" along with other promotional events. On Friday afternoon workers removed a giant Batman mask that had been mounted on the front of a theater along the Champs-Elysees, where the screening was to take place.

Warner Bros., which is owned by Time Warner, released a statement Friday, saying that the company and the filmmakers were ""deeply saddened"" and ""extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time."" Several broadcast networks and cable channels stopped running commercials on Friday for ""The Dark Knight Rises.""

The shooting inevitably stirred memories of Columbine High School and the murders there in April 1999, when two heavily armed students stalked through the hallways, killing 12 students and a teacher as they went, before shooting themselves.

And the psychological echo and the similar feel of the two massacres was palpable: Theater 9 was a place of seeming safety, if not sanctuary, not unlike Columbine's library, where some of the killings occurred. Both were ordinary settings that became death traps.

Mr. Holmes seemed ordinary too, for the most part, said Billy Kromka, a premed student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who worked with Mr. Holmes for three months last summer as a research assistant.

""There was no way I thought he could have the capacity to commit an atrocity like this,"" said Mr. Kromka, who is from Aurora. Mr. Kromka said that Mr. Holmes's ""disposition was a little off"" and that he could be socially awkward, one of the quieter people in the lab. He spent much of his time immersed in his computer, often participating in role-playing online games.

His criminal history with the Aurora Police Department consisted before Friday of one traffic summons, for speeding, in October.

A spokeswoman for the University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Jackie Brinkman, said Mr. Holmes was in the process of dropping out of school because of academic problems. She said the university was unaware of any incidents with campus police or disciplinary problems involving Mr. Holmes while he was enrolled.

Mr. Holmes grew up in a quiet, middle-class community at the eastern edge of San Diego, where his parents still live. Two-story, Spanish-style tract homes line both sides of the street, all white stucco with red tile roofs and well-kept lawns. His mother, Arlene Rosemary Holmes, is a registered nurse.

One neighbor, Margie Aguilar, said she knew the Holmes family, who she said had lived in the area for at least 10 years. Her son was a little younger than Mr. Holmes and attended the same high school, Westview, which is just up the street.

""The parents are really, really nice people,"" Ms. Aguilar said. ""This is the last thing you'd expect.""

One of the victims, Jessica Ghawi, was a 25-year-old college student and sports broadcaster active on Twitter under the name Jessica Redfield -- a tribute to her red hair. She posted early Friday that she was at the movie screening after convincing a friend to go with her.

Her brother, Jordan Ghawi, said in a blog post on Friday that when the gunfire began, Jessica took two rounds. ""My sister took one round followed by an additional round which appeared to strike her in the head,"" he wrote.

Her last tweet said the movie would start in 20 minutes.

Just a little more than a month ago, Ms. Ghawi described how she narrowly escaped a shooting rampage at a Toronto shopping mall on June 2. She had been in the food court. Her receipt showed that she made her purchase at 6:20 p.m. before what she said was an ""odd feeling"" propelled her to step outside.

The shots in Toronto rang out in the food court striking seven people about 6:23 p.m., she recalled. ""It's hard for me to wrap my mind around how a weird feeling saved me from being in the middle of a deadly shooting,"" she wrote on her blog.",2012-07-21,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.988, NEU: 0.011, NEG: 0.001})",0.9878261685371399,0.010784673504531384,0.0013892125571146607,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.870, NEU: 0.127, POS: 0.004})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.878, NEU: 0.118, POS: 0.004})",0.0036187160294502974,0.12682560086250305,0.869555652141571,0.003810940310359001,0.11839502304792404,0.8777940273284912
47,47,2012-09-07-SecondNomination.txt,"Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

Michelle, I love you so much. A few nights ago, everybody was reminded just what a lucky man I am. The other night, I think the entire country saw just how lucky I am. Malia and Sasha, we are so proud of you. And yes, you do have to go to school in the morning. And Joe Biden, thank you for being the very best Vice President I could have ever hoped for, and being a strong and loyal friend.

Madam Chairwoman, delegates, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.

Now, the first time I addressed this convention in 2004, I was a younger man; a Senate candidate from Illinois who spoke about hope -- not blind optimism, not wishful thinking, but hope in the face of difficulty; hope in the face of uncertainty, that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward, even when the odds are great, even when the road is long.

Eight years later, that hope has been tested -- by the cost of war, by one of the worst economic crises in history, and by political gridlock thatâs left us wondering whether itâs still even possible to tackle the challenges of our time.

I know campaigns can seem small, even silly sometimes. Trivial things become big distractions. Serious issues become sound bites. The truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising. If youâre sick of hearing me approve this message, believe me, so am I.

But when all is said and done -- when you pick up that ballot to vote -- you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation. Over the next few years, big decisions will be made in Washington -- on jobs, the economy, taxes and deficits, energy, education, war and peace -- decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and our childrenâs lives for decades to come.

And on every issue, the choice you face wonât just be between two candidates or two parties. It will be a choice between two different paths for America; a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future. Ours is a fight to restore the values that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known -- the values my grandfather defended as a soldier in Pattonâs Army, the values that drove my grandmother to work on a bomber assembly line while he was gone.

They knew they were part of something larger -- a nation that triumphed over fascism and depression, a nation where the most innovative businesses turned out the worldâs best products, and everyone shared in that pride and success -- from the corner office to the factory floor. My grandparents were given the chance to go to college, buy their own -- their own home, and fulfill the basic bargain at the heart of Americaâs story: the promise that hard work will pay off, that responsibility will be rewarded, that everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules -- from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington, D.C.

And I ran for President because I saw that basic bargain slipping away. I began my career helping people in the shadow of a shuttered steel mill, at a time when too many good jobs were starting to move overseas. And by 2008, we had seen nearly a decade in which families struggled with costs that kept rising but paychecks that didnât, folks racking up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition,  put gas in the car or food on the table. And when the house of cards collapsed in the Great Recession, millions of innocent Americans lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings -- a tragedy from which we're still fighting to recover.

Now, our friends down in Tampa at the Republican convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with America, but they didnât have much to say about how theyâd make it right. They want your vote, but they donât want you to know their plan. And thatâs because all they have to offer is the same prescriptions theyâve had for the last 30 years: ""Have a surplus? Try a tax cut."" ""Deficit too high? Try another."" ""Feel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning!""

Now, Iâve cut taxes for those who need it -- middle-class families, small businesses -- but I donât believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores, or pay down our deficit. I donât believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy, or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China. After all weâve been through, I donât believe that rolling back regulations on Wall Street will help the small businesswoman expand, or the laid-off construction worker keep his home. We have been there. Weâve tried that. And weâre not going back. We are moving forward, America.

Now, I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy. I never have. You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades. It'll require common effort, shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one. And by the way, those of us who carry on his party's legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government program or dictate from Washington.

But know this, America: Our problems can be solved. Our challenges can be met. The path we offer may be harder but it leads to a better place, and I'm asking you to choose that future. I'm asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country, goals in manufacturing, energy, education, national security, and the deficit -- real, achievable plans that will lead to new jobs, more opportunity, and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation. That's what we can do in the next four years, and that is why I am running for a second term as President of the United States.

We can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs. After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed, we're getting back to basics and doing what America's always done best. We are making things again. I've met workers in Detroit and Toledo who feared they'd never build another American car; and today they can't build them fast enough because we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on the top of the world. I worked with business leaders who are bringing jobs back to America not because our workers make less pay, but because we make better products -- because we work harder and smarter than anyone else. I've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers, goods that are stamped with three proud words: ""Made in America."" And after a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two-and-half years.

And now you have a choice: We can give more tax breaks to corporations that shift jobs overseas or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here in the United States of America. We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports. And if we choose this path, we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years.

You can make that happen. You can choose that future.

You can choose the path where we control more of our own energy. After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. We have doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries. In the last year alone, we cut oil imports by one million barrels a day, more than any Administration in recent history. And today the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades.

So now you have a choice, between a strategy that reverses this progress or one that builds on it. We've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we'll open more. But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country's energy plan or endanger our coastlines or collect another four billion dollars in corporate welfare from our taxpayers. We're offering a better path.

We're offering a better path where we -- a -- a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal, where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks, where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy, where -- where we develop a hundred-year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet. If you choose this path, we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone. And yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet, because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future. And in this election, you can do something about it.

You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete, no matter how old they are or how much money they have.

Education was the gateway to opportunity for me. It was the gateway for Michelle. It was -- It was the gateway for most of you. And now more than ever it is the gateway to a middle-class life. For the first time in a generation, nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning. Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading. Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders.

And now you have a choice. We can gut education, or we can decide that in the United States of America, no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school. No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money. No company should have to look for workers overseas because they couldn't find any with the right skills here at home. That's not our future. That is not our future.

A government has a role in this -- but teachers must inspire; principals must lead; parents must instill a thirst for learning; and students, you've got to do the work. And together, I promise you we can out-educate and outcompete any nation on earth.

So help me. Help me recruit a hundred thousand math and science teachers within 10 years and improve early childhood education. Help give two million workers the chance to learn skills at their community college that will lead directly to a job. Help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next 10 years. We can meet that goal together. You can choose that future for America. That's our future.

You know, in a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven. Four years ago I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have. We've blunted the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan and in 2014, our longest war will be over. A new tower rises above the New York skyline; al-Qaida is on the path to defeat; and Osama bin Laden is dead.

And tonight we pay tribute to the Americans who still serve in harm's way. We are forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice has made this country safer and more respected. We will never forget you and so long as I'm Commander-in-Chief we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known. When you take off the uniform, we will serve you as well as you've served us, because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care that they need when they come home.

Around the world, we've strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. We've reasserted our power across the Pacific and stood up to China on behalf of our workers. From Burma to Libya to South Sudan, we have advanced the rights and dignity of all human beings -- men and women, Christians and Muslims and Jews.

But for all the progress that we've made, challenges remain. Terrorist plots must be disrupted. Europe's crisis must be contained. Our commitment to Israel's security must not waver, and neither must our pursuit of peace. The Iranian government must face a world that stays united against its nuclear ambitions. The historic change sweeping across the Arab world must be defined not by the iron fist of a dictator or the hate of extremists, but by the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people who are reaching for the same rights that we celebrate here today.

So now we have a choice. My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy. But from all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly. After all, you don't call Russia our number one enemy1 -- not al-Qaida, Russia -- unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp. You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally.

My opponent -- My opponent said that it was tragic to end the war in Iraq. And he won't tell us how he'll end the war in Afghanistan. Well, I have, and I will. And while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our Joint Chiefs don't even want, I will use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work -- rebuilding roads and bridges, and schools and runways, because after two wars that have cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, it's time to do some nation building right here at home.

You can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class. Independent experts say that my plan would cut our deficit by four trillion dollars. And last summer I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut a billion dollars in spending, because those of us who believe government can be a force for good should work harder than anyone to reform it so that it's leaner and more efficient and more responsive to the American people.

I want to reform the tax code so it's simple, fair, and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over 250,000 dollars -- the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was President, the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot.

Now, I'm still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission. No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. I want to get this done, and we can get it done. But when Governor Romney and his friends in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficits by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy, well -- what'd Bill Clinton call it? You do the arithmetic. You do the math.

I refuse to go along with that, and as long as I'm President I never will. I refuse to ask middle-class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut. I refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of Head Start programs to eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor and elderly or disabled -- all so those with the most can pay less. I'm not going along with that.

And I will never -- I will never turn Medicare into a voucher. No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies. They should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned. Yes, we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more. And we will keep the promise of Social Security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it, not by turning it over to Wall Street.

This is the choice we now face. This is what the election comes down to. Over and over, we've been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way, that since government can't do everything, it should do almost nothing. If you can't afford health insurance, hope that you don't get sick. If a company releases toxic pollution into the air your children breathe, well, that's the price of progress. If you can't afford to start a business or go to college, take my opponent's advice and borrow money from your parents.

You know what? That's not who we are. That's not what this country's about. As Americans, we believe we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, rights that no man or government can take away. We insist on personal responsibility and we celebrate individual initiative. We're not entitled to success. We have to earn it. We honor the strivers, the dreamers, the risk-takers, the entrepreneurs who have always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system, the greatest engine of growth and prosperity that the world's ever known.

But we also believe in something called ""citizenship"" -- citizenship, a word at the very heart of our founding, a word at the very essence of our democracy, the idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations.

We believe that when a CEO pays his autoworkers enough to buy the cars that they build, the whole company does better.

We believe that when a family can no longer be tricked into signing a mortgage they can't afford, that family's protected, but so is the value of other people's homes -- and so is the entire economy.

We believe the little girl who's offered an escape from poverty by a great teacher or a grant for college could become the next Steve Jobs or the scientist who cures cancer or the President of the United States -- and it is in our power to give her that chance.

We know that churches and charities can often make more of a difference than a poverty program alone. We don't want handouts for people who refuse to help themselves, and we certainly don't want bailouts for banks that break the rules.

We don't think the government can solve all of our problems, but we don't think the government is the source of all of our problems -- any more than our welfare recipients or corporations or unions or immigrants or gays or any other group we're told to blame for our troubles -- because -- because America, we understand that this democracy is ours.

We, the people, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which asks only, what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defense. As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us. It's about what can be done by us together, through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government. That's what we believe.

So you see, the election four years ago wasn't about me. It was about you. My fellow citizens: You were the change.

You're the reason there's a little girl with a heart disorder in Phoenix who'll get the surgery she needs because an insurance company can't limit her coverage. You did that.

You're the reason a young man in Colorado who never thought he'd be able to afford his dream of earning a medical degree is about to get that chance. You made that possible.

You're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home; why selfless soldiers won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love; why thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely: ""Welcome home."" Welcome home. You did that. You did that. You did that.

If you turn away now -- If you turn away now, if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn't possible, well, change will not happen. If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference, then other voices will fill the void -- the lobbyists and special interests, the people with the 10 million dollar checks who are trying to buy this election and those who are trying to make it harder for you to vote, Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry or control health care choices that women should be making for themselves. Only you can make sure that doesn't happen. Only you have the power to move us forward.

You know, I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention. Times have changed and so have I. I'm no longer just a candidate: I'm the President. And...that means I know what it means to send young Americans into battle, for I've held in my arms the mothers and fathers of those who didn't return. I've shared the pain of families who've lost their homes, and the frustration of workers who've lost their jobs. If the critics are right that I've made all my decisions based on polls, then I must not be very good at reading them.

And while I'm very proud of what we've achieved together, I'm far more mindful of my own failings -- knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said, ""I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.""

But as I stand here tonight, I have never been more hopeful about America; not because I think I have all the answers; not because I'm naive about the magnitude of our challenges -- I'm hopeful because of you.

The young woman I met at a science fair who won national recognition for her biology research while living with her family at a homeless shelter -- she gives me hope.

The auto worker who won the lottery after his plant almost closed, but kept coming to work every day, and bought flags for his whole town and one of the cars that he built to surprise his wife -- he gives me hope.

The family business in Warroad, Minnesota, that didn't lay off a single one of their 4,000 employees when the recession hit, even when their competitors shut down dozens of plants, even when it meant the owner gave up some perks and some pay, because they understood that their biggest asset was the community and the workers who had helped build that business -- they give me hope.

I think about the young sailor I met at Walter Reed Hospital still recovering from a grenade attack that would cause him to have his leg amputated above the knee. And six months ago we would watch him walk into a White House dinner honoring those who served in Iran [Iraq], tall and 20 pounds heavier, dashing in his uniform, with a big grin on his face, sturdy on his new leg. And I remember how a few months after that I would watch him on a bicycle, racing with his fellow wounded warriors on a sparkling spring day, inspiring other heroes who had just begun the hard path he had traveled. He gives me hope. He gives me hope.

I -- I don't know what party these men and women belong to. I don't know if they'll vote for me. But I know that their spirit defines us. They remind me, in the words of Scripture, that ours is a future filled with hope. And if you share that faith with me, if you share that hope with me, I ask you tonight for your vote.

If you reject the notion that this nation's promise is reserved for the few, your voice must be heard in this election.

If you reject the notion that our government is forever beholden to the highest bidder, you need to stand up in this election.

If you believe that new plants and factories can dot our landscape, that new energy can power our future, that new schools can provide ladders of opportunity to this nation of dreamers, if you believe in a country where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules, then I need you to vote this November.

America, I never said this journey would be easy and I won't promise that now. Yes, our path is harder but it leads to a better place. Yes, our road is longer but we travel it together.

We don't turn back. We leave no one behind. We pull each other up. We draw strength from our victories and we learn from our mistakes, but we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon knowing that providence is with us and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on earth.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless these United States.
","President Barack Obama portrayed himself as a stout defender of the middle class and a leader with a plan to create jobs across the U.S. economy in a speech Thursday accepting the Democratic nomination for re-election.

The president hoped to offer voters more specifics than his Republican foe, laying out a set of goals for a second term designed to demonstrate he has started rebuilding a ravaged economy and has a strategy for going further.

The goals, most of which echo those previously set by Mr. Obama, provided a message aimed to ease the economic anxieties of Americans during the last stretch of the campaign.

""I'm asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country,"" Mr. Obama said. He cited ambitions to create manufacturing jobs, slow the growth of college tuition and bolster trade. He called them ""real, achievable plans that will lead to new jobs, more opportunity, and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation.""

""That's what we can do in the next four years,"" he said.

The president's prime-time address capped a three-day convention that focused on the economic struggles of the middle class. Democrats used the convention to argue that Mr. Obama had put the country on a path to recovery and deserved more time.

""America has turned the corner,"" Vice President Joe Biden said, taking the stage before Mr. Obama. He added: ""The work of recovery is not yet complete, but we are on our way.""

Mr. Obama's goals reflected a shrunken vision compared with the sweeping plans of his 2008 speech accepting his party's presidential nomination, which had included ""affordable, accessible health care for every single American,"" immigration reform and ""energy independence.""

Mr. Obama has signed a major health-care law but hasn't moved any immigration legislation through Congress. The crux of his energy agenda, a cap-and- trade plan, stalled in Congress.

The president said he wanted to double exports by 2014, a goal he has promoted since early 2010.

The U.S. is on track to meet that goal, given a strong rebound in global trade since the recession ended in 2009. U.S. exports in June -- the latest month available -- reached the highest level on record, partly buoyed by a relatively weak U.S. dollar.

Mr. Obama's deficit-reduction goal -- more than $4 trillion over the next decade -- mirrors a target he announced in a plan last year. The pledge is an effort to demonstrate a commitment to fiscal responsibility as Republicans press attacks over the spiraling national debt. The president also repeated his call for raising taxes on the wealthy.

Mr. Obama called for creating one million manufacturing jobs by 2016, an achievement that would largely be an extension of the surge in factory jobs over the past two years.

The number of manufacturing jobs, 12 million in July, has returned to the levels of spring 2009. A continuation of the trend would counteract a long-term decline in U.S. manufacturing.

But even creating one million such jobs wouldn't offset a decade's worth of losses. Manufacturing employment last stood at 13 million in November 2008.

On energy, Mr. Obama called for cutting oil imports in half by 2020. He also set a goal of cutting the growth of college tuition in half, to recruit 100,000 math and science teachers and train two million workers at community colleges.

Kevin Hassett, an adviser to the Romney campaign and director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said Mr. Obama was setting goals the economy was already on track to achieve.

""These are things that would likely happen if no policies changed,"" Mr. Hassett said.

The criticism echoed that of Democrats, who said Mitt Romney's goal of 12 million new jobs reflected a trend now under way.

Mr. Obama, who was elected with high expectations, sought to temper them Thursday, as he asked for voters to give him more time in the White House.

""I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy,"" Mr. Obama said.

""The truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades.""

Many voters believe Mr. Romney, a former businessman, is better suited to improve the U.S. economy. Mr. Romney said Thursday he expected Mr. Obama to offer empty promises and didn't plan to watch the speech. ""I saw the promises last time,"" Mr. Romney said during a campaign stop in Concord, N.H.

Democrats at the convention this week tried to cast the election as a choice between Mr. Romney -- portrayed as a wealthy businessman who would give more financial benefits to the rich -- and an incumbent president committed to fighting for the middle class. Mr. Obama said that where prior generations saw hard work pay off, he ""saw that basic bargain slipping away.""

Mr. Obama paired his call for higher taxes on the wealthy and for spending on social programs with a caution that he did not see the government as the solution to all problems.

""We don't think government can solve all our problems. But we don't think that government is the source of all our problems,"" he said, ""any more than are welfare recipients, or corporations, or unions, or immigrants, or gays, or any other group we're told to blame for our troubles.""

As Mr. Biden accepted the party's vice presidential nomination, he vouched for Mr. Obama as a leader and criticized Mr. Romney's business background.

""Gov. Romney believes in this global economy, it doesn't matter much where American companies invest and put their money or where they create jobs,"" Mr. Biden said. ""The most fascinating thing I found last week was when Governor Romney said that as president, he would take a jobs tour.

""Well, with all his support for outsourcing -- it's going to have to be a foreign trip.""

Mr. Obama leveled some sharp attacks against Mr. Romney on foreign policy issues.

""After all, you don't call Russia our number one enemy -- and not al Qaeda . . . unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp,"" Mr. Obama said, referring to a comment Mr. Romney made earlier this year.

He acknowledged the hope he tried to rally the nation around four years ago ""has been tested.""

""I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention,"" he said. ""Times have changed, and so have I.""","President Obama accepted the Democratic nomination for a second term on Thursday night, making a forceful argument that he had rescued the economy from disaster and ushered in a recovery that would be imperiled by a return to Republican stewardship.

Describing himself as ""mindful of my own failings,"" Mr. Obama conceded the country's continuing difficulties while defending his record and pleading for more time to carry out his agenda. He laid out a long-term blueprint for revival in an era obsessed with short-term expectations.

""I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy; I never have,"" Mr. Obama told a packed arena of 20,000 party leaders and activists. ""You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades.""

He added: ""But know this, America: Our problems can be solved. Our challenges can be met. The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And I'm asking you to choose that future.""

The president's appearance at the Time Warner Cable Arena underscored the tumultuous journey he and the country have been on since his first nomination in Denver. Four years after fireworks consecrated his storybook campaign to become the nation's first black president, Mr. Obama took the stage on Thursday as a politician who had come down to earth and was locked in the fight of his life against the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.

The stirring outsider's message had become a policy-laden appeal for continuity; the mantra of reform was now a vigorous defense of his current course. The ""Change"" signs waved in the audience in 2008 had been replaced with placards saying ""Forward."" The word ""promise,"" which he used 32 times in his acceptance speech in 2008, came up just 7 times on Thursday night. Even the traditional balloon drop was missing since a last-minute site change made it impossible.

Mr. Obama issued a string of promises, including one million new manufacturing jobs and $4 trillion in deficit reductions. But he was largely making the case that he had put in place the foundation for a revived country if voters only give it enough time to work. If at times it had the feel of a State of the Union address, that was an intentional effort to jab at Mr. Romney to be more specific about how he would carry out his promises, maximizing the gulf between the parties.

""They want your vote, but they don't want you to know their plan,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And that's because all they have to offer is the same prescription they've had for the last 30 years.""

Mr. Obama's speech punctuated back-to-back political conventions in which the two parties, if nothing else, delivered radically different visions for how to end the economic malaise that has afflicted the country since 2008, and framed the two-month spring to Election Day.

A week after Mr. Romney sought to appeal to American disappointment with Mr. Obama, the president pressed his case that the Republican candidate is so disconnected from the struggles of the middle class that he has no idea how to address them. In sharp language, he linked Mr. Romney and his running mate, Paul D. Ryan, to what he long described as failed trickle-down economic policies that favor the wealthy, reflecting what has become a central theme.

""On every issue, the choice you face won't just be between two candidates or two parties,"" Mr. Obama said. ""When all is said and done, when you pick up that ballot to vote, you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation.""

The Romney campaign released a reaction to the president's speech before it was even delivered, assailing Mr. Obama as having failed to create enough jobs, cut the deficit in half or increase incomes. ""This is a time not for him to start restating new promises, but to report on the promises he made,"" Mr. Romney said in the taped statement. ""I think he wants a promises reset. We want a report on the promises he made.""

Introducing Mr. Obama on Thursday night was Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who offered testimony to the president's leadership on everything from the economy to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. ""Bravery resides in the heart of Barack Obama,"" he said. ""This man has courage in his soul, compassion in his heart and steel in his spine.""

Mr. Biden was left to take the tougher shots at Mr. Romney, the former head of the private equity firm Bain Capital and former governor of Massachusetts. Noting that Mr. Romney had promised to take a jobs tour, Mr. Biden said, ""Well, with his support for outsourcing, it's going to have to be a foreign trip.""

He went on to note that Mr. Romney opposed the federal bailout of the auto industry. ""I think he saw it the Bain way,"" Mr. Biden said, adding: ""The Bain way may bring your firm the highest profits. But it's not the way to lead our country from the highest office.""

Mr. Biden's nomination for a second term as vice president was approved by the convention by acclamation after his son Beau, the attorney general of Delaware, put his name up for consideration in a speech that left the vice president teary-eyed for the second consecutive night.

The emotion in the packed hall crested early, when former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, her step faltering, walked tentatively onto the stage in a surprise appearance to lead the pledge of allegiance. Mrs. Giffords, who was shot in the head by a would-be assassin in Tucson, is still recovering, and she stumbled over the word ""indivisible."" But she got through the pledge in her first real public speaking since the shooting, and blew kisses to the crowd, which surged to its feet in ovation, chanting ""Gabby! Gabby!""

Given that Mr. Romney spent little time on foreign policy during his acceptance speech, it was a foregone conclusion that Mr. Obama would devote time to national security, an area where Democrats believe they have carved out a surprising advantage. They paraded a host of war veterans across the stage, some of whom chided the Republicans as taking little notice of them in Tampa last week.

""Ask Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago,"" Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said, turning a Republican line critical of the president into an argument for his re-election.

Mr. Obama said Republicans ""want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly,"" and Mr. Biden appeared to choke up reciting the numbers of war dead and wounded.

Still, the heart of the argument between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney is about the role of government. ""This is what the election comes down to,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Over and over, we've been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way, that since government can't do everything, it should do almost nothing.""

Highlighting Medicare, which Mr. Ryan has proposed overhauling, the president said, ""No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies.""

The president's speech culminated a three-day convention that included a retinue of Hollywood celebrities and even a former Republican governor, Charlie Crist of Florida, plus a strong focus on social issues like same-sex marriage.

But like its Republican equivalent last week, it did not always go according to script, including an embarrassing floor fight over Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and a late decision to move the president's speech to the Time Warner Cable Arena from the Bank of America Stadium because of inclement weather.

With thunder, lightning and rain forecast -- convention goers huddled under plastic sheets as they darted between sites -- organizers were left with some 65,000 supporters -- many of them traveling from all over the country -- without the chance to see the president in person.

The president's aides understood they could never re-create the power of the past but hoped to convince voters that more has been done than commonly recognized. The ""promises kept"" theme was intended to address the same swing voters Mr. Romney sought last week to win over.

Mr. Obama directly acknowledged the disappointments. ""While I'm proud of what we've achieved together, I'm far more mindful of my own failings,"" he said. But he added, ""I have never been more hopeful about America, not because I think I have all the answers, not because I'm naïve about the magnitude of our challenges. I'm hopeful because of you.""

The president appeared to become emotional toward the end of his speech as he spoke of wounded veterans who somehow managed to walk and run and bike on prosthetic legs. He said he did not know if they would vote for him, but added that they nonetheless gave him hope that difficulties could be overcome.

His voice started to break. ""If you share that faith with me, if you share that hope with me, I ask you tonight for your vote,"" he said.",2012-09-07,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.993, NEU: 0.005, NEG: 0.003})",0.9926010966300964,0.00479536596685648,0.0026035639457404613,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.819, NEU: 0.178, NEG: 0.003})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.610, POS: 0.372, NEG: 0.018})",0.8194076418876648,0.17807218432426453,0.0025201730895787477,0.37178847193717957,0.6104244589805603,0.017787117511034012
48,48,2012-10-29-HurricaneSandy.txt,"Hello, everybody.  I just received a full briefing from our emergency response teams, including FEMA, and agencies that are going to be helpful in the response and recovery efforts -- the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services.

Obviously, everybody is aware at this point that this is going to be a big and powerful storm.  And all across the Eastern seaboard, I think everybody is taking the appropriate preparations.
 
Iâve spoken to all the governors in all these states.  They have issues emergency declarations.  Those have been turned around quickly here in the White House.  We have prepositioned assets so that FEMA personnel are working closely with state and local governments.  Weâre making sure that food and water and emergency generation is available for those communities that are going to be hardest hit.
 
We anticipate that the center of the storm is going to land fall sometime this evening.  But because of the nature of this storm, we are certain that this is going to be a slow-moving process through a wide swath of the country, and millions of people are going to be affected.

So the most important message that I have for the public right now is, please listen to what your state and local officials are saying.  When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate.  Do not delay.  Donât pause; donât question the instructions that are being given, because this is a serious storm and it could potentially have fatal consequence if people havenât acted quickly.

The good news is, is that the governors and local officials I think have had a few days of preparation.  There's been extraordinarily close coordination between state, federal, and local governments.  And so weâre confident that the assets are prepositioned for an effective response in the aftermath of the storm. 

But keep in mind that for folks who are not following instructions, if you are not evacuating when youâve been asked to evacuate, youâre putting first responders at danger.  Weâre going to have to have search-and-rescue teams in and around multiple states all at the same time.  And although weâve got Coast Guard and the Department of Defense all positioned, if the public is not following instructions, that makes it more dangerous for people and it means that we could have fatalities that could have been avoided.
  
Transportation is going to be tied up for a long time.  And probably the most significant impact for a lot of people, in addition to flooding, is going to be getting power back on.  We anticipate that there are going to be a lot of trees down, a lot of water.  And despite the fact that the power companies are working very closely with their various state officials and local officials to make sure that they are bringing in as many assets as possible and getting those ready in preparation for the storm, the fact is that a lot of these emergency crews are not going to be able to get into position to start restoring power until some of these winds have died down.  And because of the nature of this storm, that may take several days.
 
So the public should anticipate that thereâs going to be a lot of power outages, and it may take time for that power to get back on.  The same is true with transportation; there are going to be a lot of backlogs, and even after the storm has cleared, itâs going to take a considerable amount of time for airlines, subways, trains, and so forth, potentially to get back on schedule, depending on the amount of damage that has occurred.

Let me summarize just by saying that Iâm extraordinarily grateful for the cooperation of our state and local officials.  The conversations that Iâve had with all the governors indicate that at this point there are no unmet needs.  I think everybody is taking this very seriously.  Weâve gotten prepositioned all the resources that we need.

But right now, the key is to make sure that the public is following instructions.  For those of you who still need additional information about how to respond, you can go to Ready.gov -- thatâs Ready.gov.  And that website should provide you with all the information that your family needs in terms of how you can prepare for this storm.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the people who are potentially affected.  We are extraordinarily grateful for our first responders, because theyâre going to be working 24/7 around the clock, non-stop.  And I want to make sure that our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who may end up be dealing with a very difficult situation over the next several days.

Last point Iâll make, though -- this is going to be a big storm.  Itâs going to be a difficult storm.  The great thing about America is when we go through tough times like this we all pull together.  We look out for our friends.  We look out for our neighbors.  And we set aside whatever issues we may have otherwise to make sure that we respond appropriately and with swiftness.  And thatâs exactly what I anticipate is going to happen here.

So I want to thank all the federal teams, state and local teams that are in place.  Iâm confident that weâre ready.  But I think the public needs to prepare for the fact that this is going to take a long time for us to clean up.  The good news is we will clean up and we will get through this.

Question: What about the impact on the election, sir?

President Obama: I am not worried at this point about the impact on the election.  Iâm worried about the impact on families, and Iâm worried about the impact on our first responders.  Iâm worried about the impact on our economy and on transportation. 

The election will take care of itself next week.  Right now, our number-one priority is to make sure that we are saving lives, that our search-and-rescue teams are going to be in place, that people are going to get the food, the water, the shelter that they need in case of emergency, and that we respond as quickly as possible to get the economy back on track.

Thank you, everybody.
","Hurricane Sandy loomed Sunday over the northeastern U.S., triggering evacuation orders for hundreds of thousands of residents, the cancellation of nearly 8,000 airline flights, the mass closure of schools and public transit systems and the closure of U.S. stock and options markets, as authorities warned of heavy rains, high winds and flooding when the storm reaches land late Monday or early Tuesday.

U.S. stock and options markets will close Monday, exchanges and regulators said late Sunday night, the first unscheduled, market-wide shutdown since September 2001. Markets may remain closed Tuesday, exchange officials and traders said. An earlier plan to only close floor trading was deemed too complicated, people with knowledge of the matter said. Other investors said half-empty trading desks and thin trading volume could have made the market susceptible to swings.

The Category 1 hurricane was forecast to drop 8 inches of rain on northeastern North Carolina and up to a foot in parts of the mid-Atlantic states over the next few days. Forecasters described a storm footprint expected to stretch from Washington, D.C., north to Philadelphia, New York City and Boston. The National Weather Service said two cold fronts, one west of Hurricane Sandy and another north, were drawing the warm-air hurricane toward the populous coast and expected to fortify Sandy's reach and intensity.

The unusual weather confluence will turn Sandy into a post-tropical cyclone, or nor'easter, unleashing record low-pressure readings and wind gusts to 70 miles an hour as far inland as western Pennsylvania and western New York, the National Weather Service said.

Under normal conditions, similar tropical storms would be expected to drift east and dissipate over the Atlantic. Instead, Sandy could make landfall anywhere from the Delmarva Peninsula to Long Island. Authorities late Sunday expected the storm to strike in southern New Jersey.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie warned residents along the coast: ""Don't be stupid. Get out and go to higher, safer ground.""

New York officials closed down public transit Sunday evening, a bus- and rail-system that normally ferries about 8.5 million passengers a day during the workweek. New York city schools, which serve more than a million students, also were ordered shut until the storm cleared. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told an estimated 375,000 residents to leave flood-prone neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan.

Amtrak canceled all Northeast Corridor and Keystone Service route trains on Monday, as well as other inland routes along the East Coast. New Jersey, Philadelphia and Washington also planned to shut down local transit systems.

The storm interrupted the campaigns of President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, with the election a little more than a week away. Mr. Romney canceled campaign stops in Virginia and New Hampshire. Mr. Obama moved up a planned trip to Florida for a campaign event and canceled campaign stops planned for Monday in Ohio and Virginia, as well as a Tuesday trip to Colorado.

Federal government offices in the Washington area will be closed Monday to the public, the Office of Personnel Management said Sunday. The forecast in the region called for 35- to 40-mile per hour winds Monday, along with five to 10 inches of rain.

Hurricane Sandy has already begun disrupting business, with many companies planning to close Monday. Google Inc. canceled a major event in Manhattan at which it was expected to promote a new mobile phone and a rumored redesign of its Nexus tablet. Citibank closed branches in flood-prone parts of New York City, waiving fees for its customers who use the ATMs of competing banks.

The National Weather Service said Sandy's hurricane-force winds, which extended 175 miles out from its center Sunday, could bring power outages for millions of residents. Temperatures could drop below 30 degrees in coming days across the eastern U.S., bringing further misery to those without power. West Virginia, Kentucky and other states could get up to three feet of snow in mountain areas.

Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy urged residents along the state's coastline to heed evacuation warnings. ""It appears as the worst case scenario for Connecticut is the most likely one to play itself out in the coming days,"" he said. ""We are talking about extensive flooding, maybe the worst that we've seen in 70 years.""

Once ashore, Sandy could trigger storm surges of six to 11 feet in Long Island Sound, Raritan Bay and New York harbor, as well as extensive flooding many miles inland, the National Weather Service said. Such surges in the New York area ""would be record levels,"" said Howard Glaser, director of state operations for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

""I know that we get accustomed to hearing weather forecasts and sometimes we're dubious about the weather forecasts, but this is nothing to play with, and this is nothing to take lightly, so take this seriously,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""In a situation like this, you prepare for the worst and hope for the best.""

Elsewhere, storm surges could reach six feet in parts of North Carolina, four feet in Virginia's Chesapeake Bay and six feet in Cape Cod, the weather service said. At the Norfolk Naval base, the U.S. Navy's Atlanta fleet moved ships off shore for safety.

As the forecasts for Sandy grew over the weekend, residents in North Carolina to Maine boarded up houses, tied up boats and belongings, and stocked up on food and batteries. In Norfolk, Va., some drivers showed up at gas stations before dawn Sunday to fill their tanks.

Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley predicted several days of power outages and announced that early voting planned for Monday would be rescheduled. Baltimore city officials set up shelters and gave away sandbags to residents who live near the water.

""This is a serious, killer storm,"" Mr. O'Malley said. ""It will likely take more lives as it hits the mid-Atlantic.""

Tourists in Atlantic City, N.J., placed their last few bets Sunday morning before gambling was shut down and casinos evacuated.

Many of Atlantic City's 40,000 residents appeared to be following Mr. Christie's advice. Plywood covered the windows at Mel's Furniture Factory Direct Bedding on Atlantic Avenue, with the message ""GO AWAY SANDY"" in spray paint. Jamal English said he was picking up his grandchildren, who were staying at a hotel with their mother, and leaving town.

""A lot of people are staying,"" he said. ""It's crazy, but they just don't know. I was born and raised here, so I know how this weather is, and it's going to get bad.""

In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware on Sunday afternoon, Lakhi Nainani boarded up his jewelry shop, Touch of Class. The 69-year-old man and his brother, who owns a sports shop next door, said this was only the second time they have had to board up their windows in 21 years on the boardwalk. ""I'm worried,"" Mr. Nainani said, ""but what can you do? It's Mother Nature.""

Dominion Power, which provides electricity in both Virginia and North Carolina, reported Sunday that 2,524 homes and businesses were without power.","Hurricane Sandy, a menacing monster of a storm that forecasters said would bring ""life-threatening"" flooding, churned toward some of the nation's most densely populated areas on Sunday, prompting widespread evacuations and the shutdown of the New York City transit system.

Officials warned that the hurricane, pushing north from the Caribbean after leaving more than 60 people dead in its wake, could disrupt life in the Northeast for days.

New York went into emergency mode, ordering the evacuations of more than 370,000 people in low-lying communities from Coney Island in Brooklyn to Battery Park City in Manhattan and giving 1.1 million schoolchildren a day off on Monday. The city opened evacuation shelters at 76 public schools.

The National Hurricane Center said it expected the storm to swing inland, probably on Monday evening. The hurricane center reported that the storm had sustained winds of almost 75 miles an hour.

""We're going to have a lot of impact, starting with the storm surge,"" said Craig Fugate, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""Think, 'Big.' ""

The subway closing began at 7 p.m. to darken every one of the city's 468 stations for the second time in 14 months, as officials encouraged the public to stay indoors and worked to prevent a storm surge from damaging tracks and signal equipment in the tunnels. A suspension of bus service was ordered for 9 p.m.

The closing this year seemed more ominous. The shutdown before Tropical Storm Irene last year began at noon on a Saturday, and service resumed before the workweek started on Monday. This time, officials warned, it might be Wednesday before trains were running again.

Another fear in the Northeast was that winds from the storm might knock down power lines, and that surging waters could flood utility companies' generators and other equipment.

Forecasters said the hurricane was a strikingly powerful storm that could reach far inland. Hurricane-force winds from the storm stretched 175 miles from the center, an unusually wide span, and tropical storm winds extended outward 520 miles. Forecasters said they expected high-altitude winds to whip every state east of the Mississippi River.

President Obama, who attended a briefing with officials from FEMA in Washington called Hurricane Sandy ""a big and serious storm."" He said federal officials were ""making sure that we've got the best possible response to what is going to be a big and messy system.""

""My main message to everybody involved is that we have to take this seriously,"" the president said.

The hurricane center said through the day on Sunday that Hurricane Sandy was ""expected to bring life-threatening storm surge flooding to the mid-Atlantic Coast, including Long Island Sound and New York Harbor.""

The storm preparations and cancellations were not confined to New York.

Amtrak said it would cancel most trains on the Eastern Seaboard, and Philadelphia shut down its mass transit system.

In the New York area, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's commuter rail lines, which suffered the heaviest damage during Tropical Storm Irene, were suspended beginning at 7 p.m. on Sunday.

New Jersey Transit began rolling back service gradually at 4 p.m., with a full shutdown expected by 2 a.m.

The Staten Island Ferry was scheduled to stop running by 8:30 p.m., PATH trains at midnight.

The nation's major airlines canceled thousands of flights in the Northeast. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three major airports in the New York City area, said it expected major carriers to cease operations entirely by Sunday evening. The Coast Guard closed New York Harbor -- cruise ships were told to go elsewhere -- and the Northeast faced the possibility of being all but shut down on Monday.

Federal offices in the Washington area will be closed; only emergency employees will be on the job. The Washington transit system -- its Metrorail subway and its buses -- will also be shut down.

The United Nations canceled all meetings at its headquarters in Manhattan.

Broadway shows were canceled on Sunday and Monday, as were performances at Carnegie Hall.

Schools in Baltimore, Boston and Washington called off classes for Monday.

Many public libraries said their reading rooms would be closed for the day, and parks department workers in Central Park told people to leave on Sunday and to stay away until the storm passed.

The New York Stock Exchange, which initially said its trading floor would be open on Monday, decided to close the floor and suspend all trading on Monday. The closing was the first caused by bad weather since Hurricane Gloria in 1985, although the opening bell has been delayed a number of times -- once during a blizzard in January 1996 -- and the exchange was closed for three days after the Sept. 11 attacks. The Nasdaq exchange also announced it would be closed Monday.

The hurricane center said the surges could reach 11 feet in New York Harbor, Long Island Sound and Raritan Bay in New Jersey -- significantly higher than previous forecasts and significantly above the levels recorded during the tropical storm last year.

Forecasters said the water could top 8 feet from Ocean City, Md., to the border between Connecticut and Rhode Island. They predicted the waves would rise to 6 feet on the south shore of Cape Cod.

Hour after hour on Sunday, long before high tide, high waves pounded the dunes that protect the boardwalk in Rehoboth Beach, Del.

And in East Hampton, N.Y., where Mabel Harmon and her neighbors had spent the day tying down patio furniture, the wind was already ""blowing like crazy,"" she said Sunday afternoon.

Forecasters also warned that rain could saturate the ground and that trees could tumble across roads or onto power lines.

From North Carolina to Connecticut, officials declared emergencies and directed residents to leave areas near the shore.

Delaware ordered coastal communities evacuated by 8 p.m. Sunday.

In New Jersey, gamblers scrambled to play a few last rounds of blackjack before leaving the Atlantic City casinos under orders from Gov. Chris Christie.

He also ordered residents to leave barrier islands from Sandy Hook to Cape May.

In beachfront towns from North Carolina to New Jersey, the surf was spitting, and crews were rushing to build sand walls in places where the beaches had been rebuilt after 2011, when many places were hit by what was still Hurricane Irene.

In Red Hook, Brooklyn, many residents along the streets closest to New York Harbor were in their basements checking sump pumps.

Gino Vitale, a builder and landlord there, was delivering sandbags piled high in the back of his white Ford pickup truck to tenants along Conover Street, a block from New York Bay.

""We dodged most of it with Irene,"" he said, referring to the storm that flooded basements in Red Hook but not much else. ""I'm hoping we can do that again.""

For the most part, residents appeared to follow officials' advice to stock up on bottled water, canned food and flashlights -- so much so that stores ran low on batteries. Some gas stations in Connecticut had little gasoline left -- no regular, and not much premium.

In a flood-prone neighborhood in Philadelphia, Michael Dornblum did something he did not do during Tropical Storm Irene or earlier storms that brought high water -- he put 80-pound sandbags outside his family's furniture store. In the past, he has lined them up only inside. He put the additional protection in place as employees prepared to lift carpets and sofas off the showroom floor. Some went to a storage area on the second floor.

Con Edison did not provide an estimate of how long customers in the New York City area might be without power if the storm played havoc with its network; by contrast, the parent company of Jersey Central Power and Light warned as long ago as Friday that repairs could take 10 days after the storm passed through. Another utility in New Jersey, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, said that restoring power could take a week.

Forecasters said Hurricane Sandy could deliver something besides wind and rain: snow. That is because a system known as a midlatitude trough -- which often causes severe winter storms -- was moving across the country from the west. It was expected to draw in Hurricane Sandy, giving it added energy.

A blast of arctic air is expected to sweep down through the Canadian Plains just as the two storms converge. That could lead to several feet of heavy, wet snow in West Virginia and lighter amounts in Pennsylvania and Ohio that could bring down trees and power lines if already chilly temperatures drop below freezing.

The full moon on Monday could cause even greater flooding, because tides will be at their peak.

The possibility of a higher surge was one reason that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York ordered mandatory evacuations in low-lying areas, just as he did before Tropical Storm Irene. One city official said there was particular concern about Con Edison's Lower Manhattan infrastructure, noting that if the storm surge washed over the bulkheads, it could damage the utility's electrical and steam networks. If the surge runs as high as forecast, Con Ed will shut off two electrical networks in Lower Manhattan,

As for the subway shutdown, Mr. Bloomberg said that if the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had not suspended service, but instead had left itself vulnerable to the storm, the city would have risked being without its mass transit network for even longer.

""They do have to make sure that their equipment doesn't get damaged,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""Otherwise we would not have subway trains when this is over or buses when it's over.""

Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the authority, said he expected the transit systems to restore at least some service about 12 hours after the storm ended. But he warned that the city could be without mass transit for as many as two full work days. ""I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to be difficult days,"" Mr. Lhota said.

But while the mayor said schoolchildren could take Monday off, city workers could not: He said that city offices would be open for business.",2012-10-29,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.565, POS: 0.432, NEG: 0.002})",0.43237894773483276,0.5654333233833313,0.002187669277191162,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.602, NEU: 0.392, POS: 0.006})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.939, NEU: 0.059, POS: 0.003})",0.006078195758163929,0.3919597864151001,0.6019620895385742,0.0028012674301862717,0.058666422963142395,0.938532292842865
49,49,2012-11-07-ObamaWinsRe-election.txt,"Thank you. Thank you so much.

Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.

It moves forward because of you.  It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression; the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope -- the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family, and we rise or fall together, as one nation, and as one people.

Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come.

I want to thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time -- by the way, we have to fix that.  Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone -- whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard, and you made a difference.

I just spoke with Governor Romney, and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard-fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely, but itâs only because we love this country deeply, and we care so strongly about its future.  From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service, and that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.

In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.

I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, Americaâs happy warrior -- the best Vice President anybody could ever hope for -- Joe Biden.

And I wouldnât be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.  Let me say this publicly -- Michelle, I have never loved you more.  I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you, too, as our nationâs First Lady. Sasha and Malia,  before our very eyes, you're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom.  And Iâm so proud of you guys.  But I will say that for now, one dog is probably enough.

To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics -- the best.  The best ever. Some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning.  But all of you are family.  No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together, and you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful President.  Thank you for believing all the way, through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way.  And I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in.

I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly.  And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos, or the domain of special interests.  But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies, and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym, or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else.

Youâll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer whoâs worked his way through college, and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.  Youâll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer whoâs going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.  Youâll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse whoâs working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job, or a roof over their head when they come home.

Thatâs why we do this.  Thatâs what politics can be.  Thatâs why elections matter.  It's not small; it's big.  It's important.

Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.  We have our own opinions.  Each of us has deeply held beliefs.  And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.  That wonât change after tonight -- and it shouldnât.  These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty, and we can never forget that as we speak, people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter, the chance to cast their ballots like we did today.

But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for Americaâs future.  We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers -- a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation, with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow.

We want our children to live in an America that isnât burdened by debt; that isnât weakened by inequality; that isnât threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.

We want to pass on a country thatâs safe and respected and admired around the world; a nation that is defended by the strongest military on Earth and the best troops this world has ever known -- but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being.

We believe in a generous America; in a compassionate America; in a tolerant America, open to the dreams of an immigrantâs daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag.  To the young boy on the South Side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner. To the furniture workerâs child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a President.  Thatâs the future we hope for.  Thatâs the vision we share.  Thatâs where we need to go.  Forward. That's where we need to go.       

Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there.  As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts.  It's not always a straight line.  It's not always a smooth path.  By itself, the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams wonât end all the gridlock, or solve all our problems, or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus, and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward.  But that common bond is where we must begin.

Our economy is recovering.  A decade of war is ending.  A long campaign is now over. And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you.  I have learned from you.  And you've made me a better President.  With your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do, and the future that lies ahead.

Tonight, you voted for action, not politics as usual.  You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours.  And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together:  reducing our deficit;  reforming our tax code; fixing our immigration system; freeing ourselves from foreign oil.  We've got more work to do.

But that doesnât mean your work is done.  The role of citizen in our democracy does not end with your vote.  America has never been about what can be done for us.  Itâs about what can be done by us, together, through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government.  That's the principle we were founded on.  

This country has more wealth than any nation, but thatâs not what makes us rich.  We have the most powerful military in history, but thatâs not what makes us strong.  Our university,  culture are the envy of the world, but thatâs not what keeps the world coming to our shores.

What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on Earth -- the belief that our destiny is shared; that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another, and to future generations; that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for comes with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.  That's what makes America great.

I am hopeful tonight because I have seen this spirit at work in America.  Iâve seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors, and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job.

Iâve seen it in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, and in those SEALs who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them, watching their back.

Iâve seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York, where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm.

And I saw it just the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his eight-year-old daughter, whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything, had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.  I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father, but meet this incredible daughter of his.  And when he spoke to the crowd, listening to that fatherâs story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes, because we knew that little girl could be our own.  And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright.

Thatâs who we are.  Thatâs the country I'm so proud to lead as your President.  And tonight, despite all the hardship weâve been through, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about our future.  I have never been more hopeful about America.  And I ask you to sustain that hope.

Iâm not talking about blind optimism -- the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path.  Iâm not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight.  I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us, so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting.

America, I believe we can build on the progress weâve made, and continue to fight for new jobs, and new opportunity, and new security for the middle class.  I believe we can keep the promise of our founding -- the idea that if youâre willing to work hard, it doesnât matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you look like, or where you love -- it doesnât matter whether you're black or white, or Hispanic or Asian, or Native American, or young or old, or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight -- you can make it here in America if youâre willing to try.

I believe we can seize this future together -- because we are not as divided as our politics suggest; we're not as cynical as the pundits believe; we are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions; and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states.  We are, and forever will be, the United States of America.  And together, with your help, and Godâs grace, we will continue our journey forward, and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth. 

Thank you, America.  God bless you.  God bless these United States.
","President Barack Obama won re-election Tuesday in a closely fought race, overcoming the doubts of a nation ravaged by a prolonged economic downturn and setting up a test of whether he can forge a productive second term in a divided political system.

Mr. Obama's victory in the bruising campaign marks a landmark in modern election history. No sitting president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 has won re-election with a higher unemployment rate, which stands at 7.9%. It is also the first time since 1816 the U.S. has had three consecutive two-term presidents.

In retaining the presidency, Mr. Obama, 51 years old, defeated former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, 65, who had been seeking the office for six years.

""We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future,"" the president said in a victory speech that came after 1:30 a.m. Eastern time. He said he would meet with Mr. Romney in the coming weeks to discuss various issues confronting the country.

Mr. Romney said in his concession speech, ""I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction. But the nation chose another leader.""

Propelling Mr. Obama to victory was the unique coalition he forged four years ago, one that reflects the changing nature of the U.S. electorate -- notably, the diminished influence of white Americans and the rising clout of Latino voters.

Greeting Mr. Obama will be a divided Congress. Democrats retained their Senate majority while Republicans looked set to keep control of the House of Representatives. After the election, Washington remained aligned exactly as it was Tuesday morning, despite $6 billion in spending and 1.2 million political ads in the presidential race alone.

Americans handed Mr. Obama the job of navigating conflicting impulses in both Washington and the nation, a partisan divide the president has previously struggled to master.

Despite Mr. Romney's focus on the economy, pitching himself as a onetime businessman capable of fixing what ails the U.S., he couldn't overcome missteps and attacks from Democrats over his work as a private-equity executive.

At stake were two starkly different visions of the role of government and the recipe for economic revival. Mr. Romney called for reducing taxes and scaling back regulations, which he said would trigger economic growth.

Mr. Obama laid out a model of public investment in alternative energy and education, along with tax increases on wealthier families to help cut deficits. He has also voiced plans to pursue a revamp of U.S. immigration laws.

The president's re-election campaign was light on details of his second-term agenda, in contrast to the ambitious list he brought to the office in 2008.

Mr. Obama sealed his victory with wins in swing states including Ohio, Colorado and Virginia. He was running neck and neck in Florida.

The contest showed how dramatically the U.S. has changed in recent years. According to exit polls, Mr. Romney won 60% of the white vote. Mr. Obama won 38%, five points less than his 2008 showing. Not since Walter Mondale, who was swept aside by Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential race, has a Democrat recorded a smaller share of the white vote.

Mr. Obama will have little time to savor his victory. Looming almost immediately is the so-called fiscal cliff, a series of tax increase and spending cuts that come into force Jan. 1, and which could unravel the economy's fragile gains, unless the president and congressional leaders engineer a compromise. The U.S. will also hit its borrowing limit in coming months, raising the prospect of a battle like the one last year that led to a downgrade of the U.S. debt rating.

Mr. Obama hopes to broker a far-reaching agreement, the kind of ""grand bargain"" that eluded him last year, which would include raising taxes on wealthier Americans. Republicans have said they would oppose any tax increase. The White House is already working to convene a meeting between the president and congressional leaders.

A key player will be Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Mr. Romney's running mate and an expert on fiscal matters, who retained his House seat.

Mr. Obama notched a victory in a political climate that seemed ripe for his defeat. Polls showed more than half the population believed the U.S. was on the wrong track, and that the government performs too many functions best done by the private sector -- attitudes that would seem to favor Republicans.

Mr. Obama was favored to win for most of the campaign, but the race narrowed in the final month after he turned in a lackluster performance in the first of three presidential debates.

Mr. Romney closed the gap in the polls, raising the possibility that the nation's first African-American president might be voted from office at the end of a single term.

Mr. Obama prevailed through an aggressive and well-funded campaign. He championed middle-class interests while depicting Mr. Romney as an uncaring businessman whose economic policies would favor the wealthiest Americans.

The campaign's tone was coarse. Mr. Obama largely jettisoned the hopeful message of his 2008 campaign, convinced that to win he needed to paint Mr. Romney as an unpalatable alternative.

Mr. Obama's rise to power might have been dismissed as a fluke had he not secured a second term. His biography is nothing like that of recent predecessors. Mr. Obama was raised by a single mother and his grandparents. His father was from Kenya and his mother's family from Kansas. Mr. Obama spent most of his childhood in Hawaii, where he attended a prestigious private school. After graduating from Columbia University, he attended Harvard Law School, becoming the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review. He eventually moved to Chicago, where he became a community organizer and met his wife, first lady Michelle Obama.

His political resume is short. He served in the Illinois State Senate until 2004, when he captivated the nation with a keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He was elected to the U.S. Senate that same year and hadn't served a full term before he won the White House in 2008.

His first term included passage of the health-care law, the financial regulation bill and a series of dramatic interventions to save the banking system from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.

After the midterm elections in 2010, Republicans took charge of the House and Mr. Obama was forced to curb his ambitions.

The president has predicted that he would have better results in a second term. David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said any ill will from the election would quickly vanish.

Mr. Obama has said he would push several pieces of unfinished business left over the first term. He wants to pass an immigration overhaul that would provide a path to legal status for the 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally.

Republicans might conclude it is in their interest to cooperate. In Tuesday's elections, the GOP got a lesson in the dangers of alienating Latinos. Many Republicans strategists have said the party must soften its stance on illegal immigration. Latinos now account for 16% of the population, and that figure is expected to jump to 22% by 2030.

With Hurricane Sandy ravaging the east coast, Mr. Obama had a chance to show compassion to storm victims and deploy government resources to neighborhoods left in ruins. No less a critic than New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who gave the keynote speech at Mr. Romney's nominating convention, went out of his way to praise Mr. Obama's performance. About two-thirds of the public approved of the president's handling of Hurricane Sandy, a Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll showed.

Worse for Mr. Romney, the storm froze the race at a moment when he had been gaining momentum and cutting into Mr. Obama's lead. Sandy diverted the nation's attention for precious days, forcing Mr. Romney to cancel some events and juggle attacks on Obama with expressions of sympathy for storm victims.

Still, Mr. Obama's re-election would have seemed unlikely in the nadir of his presidency, the fall of 2010, when voters in the midterm election gave Republicans control of the House. Mr. Obama termed that election, ""a shellacking."" White House advisers turned their attention to his political revival, knowing he was in a tough spot.

Unemployment hovered near 10%. Aides worried that independent voters had abandoned the president. And internal focus groups showed that voters didn't give credit to Mr. Obama for the stimulus program, even though many economists concluded the stimulus staved off an even more serious downturn.

Aides settled on a strategy that emphasized steady improvement in the jobless rate while positioning Mr. Obama as a champion of the middle class.

Rather than save their money for the post-Labor Day race to November, the Obama campaign spent millions of dollars in TV ads attacking Mr. Romney for his record at the private-equity firm, Bain Capital. They painted him as a predatory capitalist who bought companies and laid people off in search of a quick profit.

Mr. Obama burned through a good chunk of his campaign cash, making some Democrats uneasy. But he made Mr. Romney unpopular among voters.

In the end, Mr. Obama suffered no shortage of funds. In September alone, he took in $181 million in campaign donations. All together, the president and allied groups will have raised nearly $1 billion over the course of the campaign.","Barack Hussein Obama was re-elected president of the United States on Tuesday, overcoming powerful economic headwinds, a lock-step resistance to his agenda by Republicans in Congress and an unprecedented torrent of advertising as a divided nation voted to give him more time.

In defeating Mitt Romney, the president carried Colorado, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin, a near sweep of the battleground states, and was holding a narrow advantage in Florida. The path to victory for Mr. Romney narrowed as the night wore along, with Mr. Obama winning at least 303 electoral votes.

A cheer of jubilation sounded at the Obama campaign headquarters in Chicago when the television networks began projecting him as the winner at 11:20 p.m., even as the ballots were still being counted in many states where voters had waited in line well into the night. The victory was far narrower than his historic election four years ago, but it was no less dramatic.

""Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back,"" Mr. Obama told his supporters early Wednesday. ""We know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come.""

Mr. Obama's re-election extended his place in history, carrying the tenure of the nation's first black president into a second term. His path followed a pattern that has been an arc to his political career: faltering when he seemed to be at his strongest -- the period before his first debate with Mr. Romney -- before he redoubled his efforts to lift himself and his supporters to victory.

The evening was not without the drama that has come to mark so many recent elections: For more than 90 minutes after the networks projected Mr. Obama as the winner, Mr. Romney held off calling him to concede. And as the president waited to declare victory in Chicago, Mr. Romney's aides were prepared to head to the airport, suitcases packed, potentially to contest several close results.

But as it became increasingly clear that no amount of contesting would bring him victory, he called Mr. Obama to concede shortly before 1 a.m.

""I wish all of them well, but particularly the president, the first lady and their daughters,"" Mr. Romney told his supporters in Boston. ""This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation.""

Hispanics made up an important part of Mr. Obama's winning coalition, preliminary exit poll data showed. And before the night was through, there were already recriminations from Republican moderates who said Mr. Romney had gone too far during the primaries in his statements against those here illegally, including his promise that his get-tough policies would cause some to ""self-deport.""

Mr. Obama, 51, faces governing in a deeply divided country and a partisan-rich capital, where Republicans retained their majority in the House and Democrats kept their control of the Senate. His re-election offers him a second chance that will quickly be tested, given the rapidly escalating fiscal showdown.

For Mr. Obama, the result brings a ratification of his sweeping health care act, which Mr. Romney had vowed to repeal. The law will now continue on course toward nearly full implementation in 2014, promising to change significantly the way medical services are administrated nationwide.

Confident that the economy is finally on a true path toward stability, Mr. Obama and his aides have hinted that he would seek to tackle some of the grand but unrealized promises of his first campaign, including the sort of immigration overhaul that has eluded presidents of both parties for decades.

But he will be venturing back into a Congressional environment similar to that of his first term, with the Senate under the control of Democrats and the House under the control of Republicans, whose leaders have hinted that they will be no less likely to challenge him than they were during the last four years.

The state-by-state pursuit of 270 electoral votes was being closely tracked by both campaigns, with Mr. Romney winning North Carolina and Indiana, which Mr. Obama carried four years ago. But Mr. Obama won Michigan, the state where Mr. Romney was born, and Minnesota, a pair of states that Republican groups had spent millions trying to make competitive.

Americans delivered a final judgment on a long and bitter campaign that drew so many people to the polls that several key states extended voting for hours. In Virginia and Florida, long lines stretched from polling places, with the Obama campaign sending text messages to supporters in those areas, saying: ""You can still vote.""

Neither party could predict how the outcome would affect the direction of the Republican Party. Moderates were hopeful it would lead the rank and file to realize that the party's grass-roots conservatism that Mr. Romney pledged himself to during the primaries doomed him in the general election. Tea Party adherents have indicated that they will argue that he was damaged because of his move to middle ground during the general election.

As he delivered his brief concession speech early Wednesday, Mr. Romney did not directly address the challenges facing Republicans. His advisers said that his second failed quest for the White House would be his last, with his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, standing as one of the leaders of the party.

""We have given our all to this campaign,"" said Mr. Romney, stoic and gracious in his remarks. ""I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction.""

The results were more a matter of voters giving Mr. Obama more time than a second chance. Through most of the year slight majorities of voters had told pollsters that they believed his policies would improve the economy if they could stay in place into the future.

Mr. Obama's campaign team built its coalition the hard way, through intensive efforts to find and motivate supporters who had lost the ardor of four years ago and, Mr. Obama's strategists feared, might not find their way to polls if left to their own devices.

Up against real enthusiasm for Mr. Romney -- or, just as important, against Mr. Obama -- among Republicans and many independents, their strategy of spending vast sums of money on their get-out-the-vote operation seemed vindicated on Tuesday.

As opinion surveys that followed the first debate between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama showed a tightening race, Mr. Obama's team had insisted that its coalition was coming together as it hoped it would. In the end, it was not a bluff.

Even with Mr. Obama pulling off a new sweep of the highly contested battlegrounds from Nevada to New Hampshire, the result in each of the states was very narrow. The Romney campaign was taking its time early Wednesday to review the outcome and searching for any irregularities.

The top issue on the minds of voters was the economy, according to interviews, with three-quarters saying that economic conditions were not good or poor. But only 3 in 10 said things were getting worse, and 4 in 10 said the economy was improving.

Mr. Romney, who campaigned aggressively on his ability to turn around the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression, was given a narrow edge when voters were asked which candidate was better equipped to handle the economy, the interviews found.

The electorate was split along partisan lines over a question that drove much of the campaign debate: whether it was Mr. Obama or his predecessor, George W. Bush, who bore the most responsibility for the nation's continued economic challenges. About 4 in 10 independent voters said that Mr. Bush should be held responsible.

The president built a muscular campaign organization and used a strong financial advantage to hold off an array of forces that opposed his candidacy. The margin of his victory was smaller than in 2008 -- he held an advantage of about 700,000 in the popular vote early Wednesday -- but a strategic firewall in several battleground states protected his Electoral College majority.

As Mr. Romney gained steam and stature in the final weeks of the campaign, the Obama campaign put its hopes in perhaps one thing above all others: that the rebound in the auto industry after the president's bailout package of 2009 would give him the winning edge in Ohio, a linchpin of his road to re-election.

Early interviews with voters showed that just over half of Ohio voters approved of the bailout, a result that was balanced by a less encouraging sign for the president: Some 4 in 10 said they or someone in their household had lost a job over the last four years.

He defeated Mr. Romney 52 percent to 47 percent in Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, but only because of the number of votes he banked in the month leading up to Election Day.

Mr. Obama won despite losing some of his 2008 margins among his key constituencies, including among younger voters, blacks and Jewish voters, yet he appeared to increase his share among Hispanics and Asians. Early exit poll results showed Latinos representing about 1 in 10 voters nationwide, and voting for Mr. Obama in greater numbers than four years ago, making a difference in several states, including Colorado and Florida.

He held on to female voters, according to preliminary exit polls conducted by Edison Research, but he struggled even more among white men than he did four years ago.

Mr. Romney's coalition included disproportionate support from whites, men, older people, high-income voters, evangelicals, those from suburban and rural counties, and those who call themselves adherents of the Tea Party -- a group that had resisted him through the primaries but had fully embraced him by Election Day.

The Republican Party seemed destined for a new round of self-reflection over how it approaches Hispanics going forward, a fast-growing portion of the voting population that senior party strategists had sought to woo before a strain of intense activism against illegal immigration took hold within the Republican grass roots.

It was the first presidential election since the 2010 Supreme Court decision loosening restrictions on political spending, and the first in which both major-party candidates opted out of the campaign matching system that imposes spending limits in return for federal financing. And the overall cost of the campaign rose accordingly, with all candidates for federal office, their parties and their supportive ""super PACs"" spending more than $6 billion combined.

The results Tuesday were certain to be parsed for days to determine just what effect the spending had, and who would be more irate at the answer -- the donors who spent millions of dollars of their own money for a certain outcome, or those who found a barrage of negative advertising to be major factors in their defeats.

While the campaign often seemed small and petty, with Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama intensely quarreling and bickering, the contest was actually rooted in big and consequential decisions, with the role of the federal government squarely at the center of the debate.

Though Mr. Obama's health care law galvanized his most ardent opposition, and continually drew low ratings in polls as a whole, interviews with voters found that nearly half wanted to see it kept intact or expanded, a quarter wanted to see it repealed entirely and another quarter said they wanted portions of it repealed.

In Chicago, as crowds waited for Mr. Obama to deliver his speech, his supporters erupted into a roar of relief and elation. Car horns honked from the street as people chanted the president's name.

""I feel like it's a repudiation of everything the Republicans said in the campaign,"" said Jasmyne Walker, 31, who jumped up and down on the edge of a stone planter in a downtown plaza. ""Everybody said that if he lost it would be buyer's remorse -- that we were high on hope in 2008. This says we're on the right track.

50,50,2012-12-15-SandyHook.txt,"This afternoon, I spoke with Governor Malloy and FBI Director Mueller. I offered Governor Malloy my condolences on behalf of the nation, and made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, counsel their families.

Weâve endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news I react not as a President, but as anybody else would -- as a parent.  And that was especially true today. I know thereâs not a parent in America who doesnât feel the same overwhelming grief that I do.

The majority of those who died today were children -- beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers -- men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams.

So our hearts are broken today -- for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their childrenâs innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain.

As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether itâs an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago -- these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.

This evening, Michelle and I will do what I know every parent in America will do, which is hug our children a little tighter and weâll tell them that we love them, and weâll remind each other how deeply we love one another.  But there are families in Connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. In the hard days to come, that community needs us to be at our best as Americans. And I will do everything in my power as President to help.

Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need -- to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories but also in ours.

May God bless the memory of the victims and, in the words of [Scripture], heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds.
","A man armed with two semiautomatic pistols killed 20 children at an elementary school Friday in a rampage that left 27 people dead and one injured in this suburban town before he took his own life, authorities said.

Police said the suspect, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, entered Sandy Hook Elementary School and began firing shortly after 9:30 a.m., concentrating on two classrooms. It was the second-worst campus shooting in U.S. history.

No motive was cited by authorities. State police said they found the body of someone who lived with the suspect at a house nearby. Mr. Lanza's mother was among the victims.

Diane Day, a therapist at the school, was sitting with the principal, a parent and other staff members for a meeting when she heard gunshots.

""At first we heard a bunch of kids scream, and then it was just quiet and all you could hear was the shooting,"" Ms. Day said.

Principal Dawn Hochsprung and the school psychologist leapt from their seats and ran out to help, Ms. Day said. ""They didn't think twice about confronting or seeing what was going on,"" she said.

Without a lock to secure the door, a teacher at the meeting pressed her body against the door to hold it shut, Ms. Day said. That teacher was shot through the door in the leg and arm. ""She was our hero,"" Ms. Day said.

Carrie Usher, a fourth-grade teacher, said she believed the principal turned on the campus loudspeaker system, which broadcast sounds of ""screaming and crying"" through the school to warn others. Ms. Hochsprung and the school psychologist, identified as Mary Sherlach, were reported to be among the victims.

Ms. Usher's class, meanwhile, was in the library and they hid in the closet.

""The gunfire was just unbelievable. It felt like it lasted for five minutes,"" the teacher said. ""It wouldn't stop.""

In the minutes after the shooting stopped, students were taken to a nearby firehouse that became the staging area for anxious parents who quickly streamed to the campus when the news broke. Many remained there until late Friday night, still awaiting word of their missing children, officials said.

Joe Wasik, whose daughter, Alexis, is a third-grader at the school, said his wife called a little after 10 a.m. after receiving a text from the town's automated alert system on her phone.

Checking his laptop, Mr. Wasik saw the report of a shooting and raced to the school.

""There were cars everywhere,"" he said, describing the crush of parents.

He found his daughter crying and ""a nervous wreck,"" he said. Mr. Wasik said his daughter hid in a closet during the shooting.

""Evil visited this community today,"" Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Friday.

President Barack Obama, who was notified of the shooting around 10:30 a.m., gave a televised statement from the White House, as he mourned the slain children, who were ages 5 to 10.

""They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthday, weddings, kids of their own,"" Mr. Obama said, pausing to wipe tears from his eyes.

The president said he was reacting as a parent of two daughters, describing the shooting as a ""heinous crime,"" and promising to press for meaningful action to prevent similar attacks.

""We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years,"" he said.

Lt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, said officers didn't fire their weapons after arriving at the campus, but he couldn't say with certainty how the alleged gunman was killed.

Two handguns were recovered near the gunman's body: a Glock and a Sig Sauer. A federal law-enforcement official said a .223 Bushmaster rifle was found in the back of a vehicle at the school. Earlier Friday, a law-enforcement official incorrectly identified the suspected shooter as Mr. Lanza's 24-year-old brother, Ryan. Their parents, Peter J. Lanza and Nancy J. Lanza, divorced in 2009, court records show.

The suspected gunman was an honor-roll student at Newtown High School as a ninth-grader in 2007, according to the Danbury News Times website. Beth Israel, a neighbor of the Lanzas whose daughter went to elementary school with Adam, said she recalled him as a ""socially awkward"" teenager. ""He was kind of a loner and shy,"" she said. ""He didn't look you in the eye."" His brother, Ryan, was also an honor student there, according to the honor-roll list on the newspaper's website.

The elder Mr. Lanza was taken into police custody Friday at his home in Hoboken, N.J., but wasn't considered a suspect, a law-enforcement official said.

Neighbors said the family maintained a quiet presence in the village where they lived in a yellow Colonial home with a swing set in the backyard.

Louis Belanger said he remembers Adam Lanza as a classmate in seventh grade, when the two were occasionally partners on some projects. Mr. Belanger described Mr. Lanza at the time as ""quiet, shy, fond of wearing sweaters with hoods."" Mr. Belanger, now 20 and living in Newtown, said he lost track of Mr. Lanza in high school.

Adam Lanza didn't appear in Newtown High School's 2010 yearbook; classmates said they had thought he had dropped out.

Sandy Hook Elementary has 575 students, from kindergarten through fourth grade. Families of possible victims have been assigned a personal liaison from the police force for support.

Late on Friday, state officials said they had identified all of the victims from the shooting but weren't going to release their names before Saturday.

School-safety experts said the massacre at Sandy Hook could be the worst mass shooting at a U.S. elementary or high school, exceeding the death toll at Colorado's Columbine High School in 1999, which left 15 dead, including the two students who waged the attack.

In 2007, 33 people including the gunman were shot and killed on the campus of Virginia Tech, a college in Blacksburg, Va.

Schools nationwide have increased security measures since the shooting at Columbine. Many have installed metal detectors, developed detailed crisis plans, implemented policies to keep doors locked and accessible only by buzzer, and put teachers and staff through training on how to recognize and deal with threats.

A letter sent to Sandy Hook parents earlier this year described a new security protocol at the school. Most visitors are required to show identification and ring a doorbell to gain entry to the school's front entrance, which is locked after 9:30 a.m.

""If our office staff does not recognize you,"" the letter said, ""you will be required to show identification with a picture ID.""","A 20-year-old man wearing combat gear and armed with semiautomatic pistols and a semiautomatic rifle killed 26 people -- 20 of them children -- in an attack in an elementary school in central Connecticut on Friday. Witnesses and officials described a horrific scene as the gunman, with brutal efficiency, chose his victims in two classrooms while other students dove under desks and hid in closets.

Hundreds of terrified parents arrived as their sobbing children were led out of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in a wooded corner of Newtown, Conn. By then, all of the victims had been shot and most were dead, and the gunman, identified as Adam Lanza, had committed suicide. The children killed were said to be 5 to 10 years old.

A 28th person, found dead in a house in the town, was also believed to have been shot by Mr. Lanza. That victim, one law enforcement official said, was Mr. Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, who was initially reported to be a teach at the school. She apparently owned the guns he used.

Although reports at the time indicated that the principal of the school let Mr. Lanza in because she recognized him, his mother did not work at the school, and he shot his way in, defeating a security system requiring visitors to be buzzed in. Moments later, the principal was shot dead when she went to investigate the sound of gunshots. The school psychologist was also among those who died.

The rampage, coming less than two weeks before Christmas, was the nation's second-deadliest school shooting, exceeded only by the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a gunman killed 32 people and then himself.

Law enforcement officials said Mr. Lanza had grown up in Newtown, and he was remembered by high school classmates as smart, introverted and nervous. They said he had gone out of his way not to attract attention when he was younger.

The gunman was chillingly accurate. A spokesman for the State Police said he left only one wounded survivor at the school. All the others hit by the barrage of bullets from the guns Mr. Lanza carried died, suggesting that they were shot at point-blank range. One law enforcement official said the shootings occurred in two classrooms in a section of the single-story Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Some who were there said the shooting occurred during morning announcements, and the initial shots could be heard over the school's public address system. The bodies of those killed were still in the school as of 10 p.m. Friday.

The New York City medical examiner's office sent a ""portable morgue"" to Newtown to help with the aftermath of the shootings, a spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove, confirmed late Friday.

Law enforcement officials offered no hint of what had motivated Mr. Lanza. It was also unclear, one investigator said, why Mr. Lanza -- after shooting his mother to death inside her home -- drove her car to the school and slaughtered the children. ""I don't think anyone knows the answers to those questions at this point,"" the official said. As for a possible motive, he added, ""we don't know much for sure.""

F.B.I. agents interviewed his brother, Ryan Lanza, in Hoboken, N.J. His father, Peter Lanza, who was divorced from Nancy Lanza, was also questioned, one official said.

Newtown, a postcard-perfect New England town where everyone seems to know everyone else and where there had lately been holiday tree lightings with apple cider and hot chocolate, was plunged into mourning. Stunned residents attended four memorial services in the town on Friday evening as detectives continued the search for clues, and an explanation.

Maureen Kerins, a hospital nurse who lives close to the school, learned of the shooting from television and hurried to the school to see if she could help.

""I stood outside waiting to go in, but a police officer came out and said they didn't need any nurses,"" she said, ""so I knew it wasn't good.""

In the cold light of Friday morning, faces told the story outside the stricken school. There were the frightened faces of children who were crying as they were led out in a line. There were the grim faces of women. There were the relieved-looking faces of a couple and their little girl.

The shootings set off a tide of anguish nationwide. In Illinois and Georgia, flags were lowered to half-staff in memory of the victims. And at the White House, President Obama struggled to read a statement in the White House briefing room. More than once, he dabbed his eyes.

""Our hearts are broken,"" Mr. Obama said, adding that his first reaction was not as a president, but as a parent.

""I know there is not a parent in America who does not feel the same overwhelming grief that I do,"" he said.

He called the victims ""beautiful little kids.""

""They had their entire lives ahead of them: birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own,"" he said. Then the president reached up to the corner of one eye.

Mr. Obama called for ""meaningful action"" to stop such shootings, but he did not spell out details. In his nearly four years in office, he has not pressed for expanded gun control. But he did allude on Friday to a desire to have politicians put aside their differences to deal with ways to prevent future shootings.

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, who went to Newtown, called the shootings ""a tragedy of unspeakable terms.""

""Evil visited this community today,"" he said.

Lt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, described ""a very horrific and difficult scene"" at the school, which had 700 students in kindergarten through fourth grade. It had a security protocol that called for doors to be locked during the day and visitors to be checked on a video monitor inside.

""You had to buzz in and out and the whole nine yards,"" said a former chairwoman of the Newtown board of education, Lillian Bittman. ""When you buzz, you come up on our screen.""

The lock system did not go into effect until 9:30 each morning, according to a letter to parents from the principal, Dawn Hochsprung, that was posted on several news Web sites. The letter was apparently written earlier in the school year.

It was Ms. Hochsprung, who recognized Mr. Lanza because his mother worked at the school, who let him in on Friday. Sometime later, she heard shots and went to see what was going on.

Lieutenant Vance said the Newtown police had called for help from police departments nearby and began a manhunt, checking ""every nook and cranny and every room.""

Officers were seen kicking in doors as they worked their way through the school.

Lieutenant Vance said the students who died had been in two classrooms. Others said that as the horror unfolded, students and teachers tried to hide in places the gunman would not think to look. Teachers locked the doors, turned off the lights and closed the blinds. Some ordered students to duck under their desks.

The teachers did not explain what was going on, but they did not have to. Everyone could hear the gunfire.

Yvonne Cech, a school librarian, said she had spent 45 minutes locked in a closet with two library clerks, a library catalog assistant and 18 fourth graders.

""The SWAT team escorted us out,"" she said, and then the children were reunited with their parents.

Lieutenant Vance said 18 youngsters were pronounced dead at the school and two others were taken to hospitals, where they were declared dead. All the adults who were killed at the school were pronounced dead there.

Law enforcement officials said the weapons used by the gunman were a Sig Sauer and a Glock, both handguns. The police also found a Bushmaster .223 M4 carbine.

One law enforcement official said the guns had not been traced because they had not yet been removed from the school, but state licensing records or permits apparently indicated that Ms. Lanza owned weapons of the same makes and models.

""He visited two classrooms,"" said a law enforcement official at the scene, adding that those two classrooms were adjoining.

The first 911 call was recorded about 9:30 and said someone had been shot at the school, an almost unthinkable turn of events on what had begun as just another chilly day in quiet Newtown. Soon, frantic parents were racing to the school, hoping their children were all right. By 10:30, the shooting had stopped. By then, the police had arrived with dogs.

""There is going to be a black cloud over this area forever,"" said Craig Ansman, who led his 4-year-old daughter from the preschool down the street from the elementary school. ""It will never go away.""",2012-12-15,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.749, NEG: 0.185, POS: 0.066})",0.06587494909763336,0.7493152022361755,0.1848098486661911,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.952, NEU: 0.045, POS: 0.003})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.952, NEU: 0.046, POS: 0.003})",0.0026499745436012745,0.04515785351395607,0.9521921277046204,0.0025056961458176374,0.04572201147675514,0.9517723321914673
51,51,2013-01-16-GunControl.txt,"Thank you, everybody.Â Please -- Please have a seat.Â Good afternoon, everybody.Â  Let me begin by thanking our Vice President, Joe Biden, for your dedication, Joe, to this issue, for bringing so many different voices to the table. Because while reducing gun violence is a complicated challenge, protecting our children from harm shouldnât be a divisive one. Over the month since the tragedy in Newtown, weâve heard from so many, and, obviously, none have affected us more than the families of those gorgeous children and their teachers and guardians who were lost.Â And so weâre grateful to all of you for taking the time to be here, and recognizing that we honor their memories in part by doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again. But we also heard from some unexpected people.Â In particular, I started getting a lot of letters from kids. Four of them are here today -- Grant Fritz, Julia Stokes, Hinna Zeejah, and Teja Goode.Â Theyâre pretty representative of some of the messages that I got. These are some pretty smart letters from some pretty smart young people. Hinna, a third-grader -- you can go ahead and wave, Hinna. Thatâs you. Hinna wrote, âI feel terrible for the parents who lost their childrenâ¦I love my country and [I] want everybody to be happy and safe.â And then, Grant -- go ahead and wave, Grant.Â Grant said, âI think there should be some changes. We should learn from what happened at Sandy Hookâ¦I feel really bad.â And then, Julia said -- Julia, where are you? There you go -- âIâm not scared for my safety, Iâm scared for others. I have four brothers and sisters and I know I would not be able to bear the thought of losing any of them.â These are our kids.Â This is what theyâre thinking about.Â And so what we should be thinking about is our responsibility to care for them, and shield them from harm, and give them the tools they need to grow up and do everything that theyâre capable of doing -- not just to pursue their own dreams, but to help build this country.Â This is our first task as a society, keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged.Â And their voices should compel us to change. And thatâs why, last month, I asked Joe to lead an effort, along with members of my Cabinet, to come up with some concrete steps we can take right now to keep our children safe, to help prevent mass shootings, to reduce the broader epidemic of gun violence in this country. And we can't put this off any longer.Â Just last Thursday, as TV networks were covering one of Joeâs meetings on this topic, news broke of another school shooting, this one in California. In the month since 20 precious children and six brave adults were violently taken from us at Sandy Hook Elementary, more than 900 of our fellow Americans have reportedly died at the end of a gun -- 900 in the past month.Â And every day we wait, that number will keep growing. So Iâm putting forward a specific set of proposals based on the work of Joeâs task force.Â And in the days ahead, I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality. Because while there is no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil, if there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there is even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try. And Iâm going to do my part.Â As soon as I'm finished speaking here, I will sit at that desk and I will sign a directive giving law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals and the public health community some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence. We will make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by strengthening the background check system.Â We will help schools hire more resource officers if they want them and develop emergency preparedness plans.Â We will make sure mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of violence -- even as we acknowledge that someone with a mental illness is far more likely to be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator. And while year after year, those who oppose even modest gun safety measures have threatened to defund scientific or medical research into the causes of gun violence, I will direct the Centers for Disease Control to go ahead and study the best ways to reduce it -- and Congress should fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds. We don't benefit from ignorance.Â We don't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence. These are a few of the 23 executive actions that Iâm announcing today.Â But as important as these steps are, they are in no way a substitute for action from members of Congress.Â To make a real and lasting difference, Congress, too, must act -- and Congress must act soon.Â And Iâm calling on Congress to pass some very specific proposals right away. First: Itâs time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun. The law already requires licensed gun dealers to run background checks, and over the last 14 years thatâs kept 1.5 million of the wrong people from getting their hands on a gun.Â But itâs hard to enforce that law when as many as 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without a background check. Thatâs not safe.Â That's not smart.Â Itâs not fair to responsible gun buyers or sellers.Â  If you want to buy a gun -- whether itâs from a licensed dealer or a private seller -- you should at least have to show you are not a felon or somebody legally prohibited from buying one.Â This is common sense.Â And an overwhelming majority of Americans agree with us on the need for universal background checks -- including more than 70 percent of the National Rifle Associationâs members, according to one survey.Â So thereâs no reason we canât do this. Second:Â Congress should restore a ban on military-style assault weapons, and a 10-round limit for magazines.Â The type of assault rifle used in Aurora, for example, when paired with high-capacity magazines, has one purpose -- to pump out as many bullets as possible, as quickly as possible; to do as much damage, using bullets often designed to inflict maximum damage. And that's what allowed the gunman in Aurora to shoot 70 people -- 70 people -- killing 12 in a matter of minutes. Weapons designed for the theater of war have no place in a movie theater. A majority of Americans agree with us on this. And, by the way, so did Ronald Reagan, one of the staunchest defenders of the Second Amendment, who wrote to Congress in 1994, urging them -- this is Ronald Reagan speaking -- urging them to âlisten to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of [military-style assault] weapons.â And finally, Congress needs to help, rather than hinder, law enforcement as it does its job.Â We should get tougher on people who buy guns with the express purpose of turning around and selling them to criminals.Â And we should severely punish anybody who helps them do this.Â Since Congress hasnât confirmed a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in six years, they should confirm Todd Jones, who will be -- who has been Acting, and I will be nominating for the post. And at a time when budget cuts are forcing many communities to reduce their police force, we should put more cops back on the job and back on our streets. Let me be absolutely clear. Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. I respect our strong tradition of gun ownership and the rights of hunters and sportsmen.Â There are millions of responsible, law-abiding gun owners in America who cherish their right to bear arms for hunting, or sport, or protection, or collection. I also believe most gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.Â I believe most of them agree that if America worked harder to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, there would be fewer atrocities like the one that occurred in Newtown.Â Thatâs what these reforms are designed to do.Â Theyâre common-sense measures.Â They have the support of the majority of the American people.Â  And yet, that doesnât mean any of this is going to be easy to enact or implement.Â If it were, weâd already have universal background checks.Â The ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines never would have been allowed to expire.Â More of our fellow Americans might still be alive, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries and graduations. This will be difficult.Â There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning of a tyrannical, all-out assault on liberty -- not because thatâs true, but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue for themselves.Â And behind the scenes, theyâll do everything they can to block any common-sense reform and make sure nothing changes whatsoever. The only way we will be able to change is if their audience, their constituents, their membership says this time must be different -- that this time, we must do something to protect our communities and our kids.Â  I will put everything I've got into this, and so will Joe.Â But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it.Â And by the way, that doesnât just mean from certain parts of the country.Â We're going to need voices in those areas, in those congressional districts, where the tradition of gun ownership is strong to speak up and to say this is important.Â It can't just be the usual suspects.Â We have to examine ourselves and our hearts, and ask ourselves what is important. This will not happen unless the American people demand it. If parents and teachers, police officers and pastors, if hunters and sportsmen, if responsible gun owners, if Americans of every background stand up and say, enough; weâve suffered too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue -- then change will come.Â That's what it's going to take. In the letter that Julia wrote me, she said, âI know that laws have to be passed by Congress, but I beg you to try very hard.âÂ Julia, I will try very hard. But sheâs right.Â  The most important changes we can make depend on congressional action.Â They need to bring these proposals up for a vote, and the American people need to make sure that they do. Get them on record.Â Ask your member of Congress if they support universal background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Ask them if they support renewing a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And if they say no, ask them why not. Ask them whatâs more important -- doing whatever it takes to get a A grade from the gun lobby that funds their campaigns, or giving parents some peace of mind when they drop their child off for first grade? This is the land of the free, and it always will be.Â As Americans, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights that no man or government can take away from us.Â But we've also long recognized, as our Founders recognized, that with rights come responsibilities.Â Along with our freedom to live our lives as we will comes an obligation to allow others to do the same.Â We donât live in isolation.Â We live in a society, a government of, and by, and for the people.Â We are responsible for each other.Â  The right to worship freely and safely, that right was denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.Â The right to assemble peaceably, that right was denied shoppers in Clackamas, Oregon, and moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado.Â That most fundamental set of rights to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- fundamental rights that were denied to college students at Virginia Tech, and high school students at Columbine, and elementary school students in Newtown, and kids on street corners in Chicago on too frequent a basis to tolerate, and all the families whoâve never imagined that theyâd lose a loved one to a bullet -- those rights are at stake.Â Weâre responsible. When I visited Newtown last month, I spent some private time with many of the families who lost their children that day.Â And one was the family of Grace McDonald.Â  Graceâs parents are here. Grace was seven years old when she was struck down -- just a gorgeous, caring, joyful little girl.Â Iâm told she loved pink. She loved the beach.Â  She dreamed of becoming a painter. And so just before I left, Chris, her father, gave me one of her paintings, and I hung it in my private study just off the Oval Office.Â And every time I look at that painting, I think about Grace.Â And I think about the life that she lived and the life that lay ahead of her, and most of all, I think about how, when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now -- for Grace. For the 25 other innocent children and devoted educators who had so much left to give. For the men and women in big cities and small towns who fall victim to senseless violence each and every day.Â For all the Americans who are counting on us to keep them safe from harm.Â Letâs do the right thing.Â Letâs do the right thing for them, and for this country that we love so much. Thank you.Â  Letâs sign these orders.","President Barack Obama on Wednesday will start a push for the most sweeping changes to gun laws in nearly two decades, testing whether lawmakers, including powerful members of his own party, are willing to ban the most controversial weapons and toughen requirements for prospective owners.

Flanked by children who wrote him in the aftermath of the deadly shooting spree last month at a Connecticut elementary school, Mr. Obama will call for Congress to end the sale of certain semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines, and to require background checks to screen gun buyers for criminal violations and serious mental illness, people briefed on his plans said.

His proposals will also include actions that Mr. Obama can take by using his executive powers, such as more aggressive prosecution of those who try to buy firearms illegally.

White House officials have signaled that Mr. Obama is likely to propose ideas that haven't been widely discussed in public, such as a plan to encourage target shooters to lock up their guns at target ranges rather than keep them at home, where they may be more likely to fall into the wrong hands. Mr. Obama will also move to clear the way for new federal research on gun-related injuries.

Gun control has emerged as an unexpected and urgent addition to the president's agenda, overshadowing, at least temporarily, immigration and other issues that were thought to be the first priorities of his second term. In the month since the shootings in Sandy Hook, Conn., which killed 20 children and seven adults, Mr. Obama has mobilized Vice President Joe Biden, several cabinet members and other administration officials to study gun-control measures, mental-health issues, violence in videogames and more. After meeting with dozens of groups on both sides of the gun debate, Mr. Biden delivered a long list of recommendations to the president on Monday.

Administration officials said that Mr. Obama reviewed the vice president's ideas before settling on a strategy. ""The president will announce a plan that is the president's plan,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

National Rifle Association officials already have predicted that efforts to ban high-capacity magazines and a group of semiautomatic rifles often called assault weapons would go nowhere in Congress. And lawmakers have made clear that many, if not all, of the president's recommendations will face stiff opposition.

Congress has done little in the realm of gun-control since 1994, when a crime bill that included a ban on some semiautomatic rifles was enacted. That ban expired in 2004.

Now, almost two decades since Congress took on many of these issues, Mr. Obama will run up against a powerful gun lobby and resistance from some members of his own party. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has said that he didn't believe a ban on some weapons could pass the House, and that he wasn't confident it would pass the Senate.

The legislative path for these proposals is expected to start in the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority. While some Republicans have signaled willingness to discuss gun-control measures, others have appeared unmoved on the issue.

On Tuesday, Rep. Steve Stockman (R., Texas) released a statement saying the president's plan to use executive action to address gun violence would be an unconstitutional attack on U.S. founding principles. He said he would consider eliminating funding for implementation of Mr. Obama's proposals, or even seek the impeachment of the president, to thwart this effort.

Gun-rights groups are preparing for a fight. NRA officials called a meeting last week with Mr. Biden an attack on the Second Amendment. Several gun groups have made clear that they see little they like in the expected recommendations.

Mike Hammond, legislative counsel to Gun Owners of America, said his organization would oppose every idea that has been discussed by the administration thus far. ""It's all bad,"" he said. ""It all has to be stopped.""

Still, some elements of Mr. Obama's expected plan could draw broad support, including efforts to strengthen measures to keep guns from mentally ill people considered to be a danger to themselves or others.

Rep. Chaka Fattah (D., Pa.) said one element would aim to intervene more effectively in cases of mental illness. ""In each of these mass-shooting instances, there is every reason to believe that a more robust intervention might have been able"" to prevent deaths, he said. The aim, he said, is to find ways to ""intervene prior to them walking into the movie theater or school.""

In addition, some advocates and opponents of tougher gun laws agree that the existing system for screening gun buyers has holes, because some states and federal agencies aren't diligent about adding to databases the mental-health and criminal records of people who are disqualified from buying firearms. Efforts to push states and agencies to contribute records more speedily could draw support.

Mr. Obama is likely to have a tougher challenge in trying to extend background checks to all gun purchases. Currently, buyers are screened only when they buy from a federally licensed dealer. Mr. Obama wants to extend those checks to all sales, including from nonlicensed sellers at gun shows and from sales among individual buyers and sellers. The NRA on Tuesday declined to comment on expanding background checks to all sales.

Mr. Obama will also press to install a director for the agency that most enforces gun laws, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a person briefed on his plans said. The agency hasn't had a permanent director since 2006. But it was unclear if Mr. Obama would name a new nominee and push lawmakers for confirmation, or would take a more aggressive action, such as installing a new director temporarily through his powers to make appointments when Congress is in recess.

After the president unfurls his plans, the focus quickly will shift to Congress. While executive action will be a component of Mr. Obama's strategy, administration officials have acknowledged that they will need congressional approval for many of the most significant proposals.

House Democrats have created their own task force that plans to develop a separate set of gun-control recommendations. Mr. Biden met with task force members Monday, laying out the White House's thinking about reducing gun violence.

Rep. Jackie Speier (D., Calif.), who serves on the House task force, said the Obama administration had undertaken the most comprehensive review on guns in a generation. ""Not only is this long overdue, but when we do take action, we do things that can be snuffed out,"" Ms. Speier said, noting the 1994 ban expired after 10 years.

Mr. Obama has said that changing the laws will be a steep challenge, but that difficult objectives still are worth pursuing, particularly if they could protect children's lives.

The White House's Mr. Carney said that while the president wants to move quickly, the timetable for many proposals will be Congress's prerogative.","Four days before taking the oath of office, President Obama on Wednesday staked the beginning of his second term on an uphill quest to pass the broadest gun control legislation in a generation.

In the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre, Mr. Obama vowed to rally public opinion to press a reluctant Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expand background checks, and toughen gun-trafficking laws. Recognizing that the legislative fight could be long and difficult, the president also took immediate steps by issuing a series of executive actions intended to reduce gun violence.

Surrounded by children who wrote him letters seeking curbs on guns, Mr. Obama committed himself to a high-profile and politically volatile campaign behind proposals assembled by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that will test the administration's strength heading into the next four years. The first big push of Mr. Obama's second term, then, will come on an issue that was not even on his to-do list on Election Day when voters renewed his lease on the presidency.

""I will put everything I've got into this,"" Mr. Obama said, ""and so will Joe.""

The emotionally charged ceremony, attended by family members of those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., reflected a decision by the White House to seize on public outrage to challenge the political power of the National Rifle Association and other forces that have successfully fought new gun laws for decades.

The White House is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans, including speeches around the country by the president and vice president and concerted lobbying by interest groups to influence several dozen lawmakers from both parties seen as critical to passage. The White House created a Web page with video testimonials from victims of gun violence and a sign-up for supporters to help advocate the president's plan.

""I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And, by the way, that doesn't just mean from certain parts of the country. We're going to need voices in those areas, in those Congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong, to speak up and to say this is important. It can't just be the usual suspects.""

The N.R.A. made clear that it was ready for a fight. Even before the president's speech, it broadcast a provocative video calling Mr. Obama an ""elitist hypocrite"" for opposing more armed guards in schools while his daughters had Secret Service protection. After the speech the group said it would work to secure schools, fix the mental health system and prosecute criminals but criticized the president's other proposals. ""Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,"" the N.R.A. said in a statement. ""Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected, and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.""

Mr. Obama's plan included 4 major legislative proposals and 23 executive actions that he initiated on his own authority to bolster enforcement of existing laws, improve the nation's database used for background checks and otherwise make it harder for criminals and people with mental illness to get guns.

Mr. Obama asked Congress to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale and production of assault weapons that passed in 1994 and expired in 2004. He also called for a ban on the sale and production of magazines with more than 10 rounds, like those used in Newtown and other mass shootings. Mr. Obama's plan would require criminal background checks for all gun sales, closing the longstanding loophole that allows buyers to avoid screening by purchasing weapons from unlicensed sellers at gun shows or in private sales. Nearly 40 percent of all gun sales are exempt from the system.

He also proposed legislation banning the possession or transfer of armor-piercing bullets and cracking down on ""straw purchasers,"" those who pass background checks and then forward guns to criminals or others forbidden from purchasing them.

For Mr. Obama, the plan represented a political pivot. While he has always expressed support for an assault weapons ban, he has made no real effort to pass it on the assumption that the votes were not there. But he and the White House are banking on the idea that the Newtown shooting has changed the dynamics. ""I have never seen the nation's conscience so shaken by what happened at Sandy Hook,"" Mr. Biden said Wednesday. ""The world has changed and is demanding action.""

The future of the plan may depend on how much political energy Mr. Obama puts behind it, not just to pressure Republicans but to win over Democrats who support gun rights. Even the White House considers passage of a new assault weapons ban exceedingly difficult, but there did seem to be some consensus building for expanding background checks.

Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat and a longtime gun control supporter, made no mention of the assault weapons ban in a statement but pointed to the background checks. ""If you look at the combination of likelihood of passage and effectiveness of curbing gun crime,"" he said, ""universal background checks is at the sweet spot.""

On the other side, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, dismissed an assault weapons ban as ineffective. ""But in terms of background checks, in terms of keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals and people who have serious mental health difficulties, we want to do that, and we would take a close look at that,"" he told C-Span.

Gun control groups said they would campaign hard for the president's proposals. Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said his group would focus on as many as 25 Congressional districts, including those of Democrats and Republicans. ""We will be doing what we can do to make sure that sitting on their hands is the least safe place to be,"" he said.

Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, a gun rights supporter, said he re-evaluated his position after Newtown. ""I was shaken by it, and that caused me to think in a much more probing way about the policy,"" he said in an interview. ""If it has anywhere near the impact on others that it did on me, then I think the ground shifted a lot.""

But Mr. Obama's plans still generated strong opposition. ""Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook,"" said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. ""President Obama is targeting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence.""

Other Republicans echoed those sentiments. ""The Second Amendment is nonnegotiable,"" said Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas.

Representative Dan Benishek of Michigan said in a Twitter message: ""Let me be clear, I will fight any efforts to take our guns. Not on my watch.""

Also Wednesday, Mr. Obama nominated B. Todd Jones, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to lead an agency that has not had a Senate-confirmed director since 2006.

The 23 executive actions Mr. Obama signed on Wednesday were largely modest initiatives to toughen enforcement of existing laws and to encourage federal agencies and state governments to share more information. Mr. Obama lifted a ban on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from conducting research on gun violence and directed that a letter be sent to health care providers saying doctors may ask patients about guns in their homes.

Several Republicans accused Mr. Obama of flouting Congress. ""Using executive action to attempt to poke holes in the Second Amendment is a power grab,"" said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.",2013-01-16,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.930, NEU: 0.065, NEG: 0.005})",0.9297468066215515,0.06535295397043228,0.004900205880403519,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.753, POS: 0.227, NEG: 0.020})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.698, POS: 0.291, NEG: 0.011})",0.22722028195858002,0.7525514364242554,0.020228296518325806,0.2905554473400116,0.698110044002533,0.011334535665810108
52,52,2013-01-22-InauguralAddress.txt,"Thank you, so much.  Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the United States Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens, each time we gather to inaugurate a president, we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution. We affirm the promise of our democracy. We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.  What makes us exceptional, what makes us America is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Today we continue a never ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, theyâve never been self-executing. That while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by his people here on earth. The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few, or the rule of a mob. They gave to us a republic, a government of, and by, and for the people. Entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed. And for more than 200 years we have. Through blood drawn by lash, and blood drawn by sword, we noted that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half slave, and half free. We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together. Together we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce, schools and colleges to train our workers. Together we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play. Together we resolve that a great nation must care for the vulnerable and protect its people from lifeâs worst hazards and misfortune. Through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all societies ills can be cured through government alone. Our celebration of initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character.  But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of todayâs world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias. No single person can train all the math and science teachers weâll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores. Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people. This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. Â A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. Americaâs possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: Â youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.Â My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together. For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. We believe that Americaâs prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class. We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship.Â We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own. We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time. So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher. But while the means will change, our purpose endures. A nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American.Â That is what this moment requires.Â That is what will give real meaning to our creed. We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity.Â We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit.Â But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future. For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us at any time may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great. We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.Â Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition, we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries, we must claim its promise. Thatâs how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure -- our forests and waterways, our crop lands, and snow-capped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. Thatâs what will lend meaning to the creed our Fathers once declared. We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war. Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty. The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war; who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends -- and we must carry those lessons into this time as well. We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law.Â We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully -- not because we are naÃ¯ve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear. America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe.Â And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation.Â We will support democracy from Asia to Africa, from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom. And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice -- not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes:Â tolerance and opportunity, human dignity, and justice. We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to heara ""King"" proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth. It is now our generationâs task to carry on what those pioneers began.Â For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the lawÂ -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote. Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity -- until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country. Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia, to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm. That is our generationâs task: to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American. Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life. It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness. Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time. For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that todayâs victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall. My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction. And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.Â But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream. My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride. They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope. You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this countryâs course.Â You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals. Let us, each of us, now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright. With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom. Thank you.  God bless you. And may He forever bless these United States of America.","President Barack Obama began his second term Monday by setting an agenda for the next four years built on bedrock Democratic social policies, in a provocative speech coming at a time of deep partisanship in the capital and lingering economic uncertainty across the country.

With specifics not usually offered in inaugural addresses, Mr. Obama promised to preserve government health-care programs, expand rights for women and gay couples, and press for gun controls, overhauls of the tax code and immigration laws, as well as climate-change measures.

His priorities sent a message to Washington's leaders that he is looking beyond the fiscal battles set to dominate the coming weeks, while signaling to the nation that he sees a large part of his legacy to be advocacy for underprivileged Americans.

""For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,"" Mr. Obama said in a 15-minute speech that drew repeatedly on the opening phrase of the Constitution.

Mr. Obama laid out a governing agenda rooted in Democratic policy goals and equal rights, citing Seneca Falls, N.Y., Selma, Ala., and New York City's Stonewall Inn, birthplaces of the movements for women's equality, civil rights and gay liberation, respectively. ""That is our generation's task -- to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American,"" the president said.

Mr. Obama took the ceremonial oath of office shortly before noon in front of hundreds of thousands of Americans stretching across the National Mall. In the speech that followed, he sought to reassure Democrats that he wouldn't compromise on their core principles and to warn Republicans he planned to pursue policies that place the two parties squarely at odds.

His second inaugural address did little to puncture the toxic air in Washington, essentially doing away with the signature goal of bridging the capital's political divide that he set when he was sworn in four years ago. Republicans widely viewed the speech as confrontational. Rather than a new beginning, they saw it as the capstone of two years of divided government in which the two parties have struggled to reach policy agreements.

""I am hoping that the president will recognize that compromise should have been the words for today, and they clearly weren't,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.). ""We were hoping that he would use this day to reach out to all Americans and to all parties. He clearly did not.""

The president never mentioned Republicans specifically, but his criticisms were clear. He laced his speech with themes from his presidential campaign, including a reference to the country's prosperity resting ""upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.""

He also vigorously defended social safety-net programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. GOP leaders have proposed cutting the programs in recent budget negotiations, and some Democrats have worried that Mr. Obama would agree, given that he has said he is open to such changes as part of a broad deficit-reduction deal that includes tax increases.

""These things do not sap our initiative,"" Mr. Obama said of the three programs. ""They strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.""

Mr. Obama had taken the official oath of office Sunday in a quiet ceremony with family at the White House, in accord with the Jan. 20 date set in the Constitution for the start of presidential terms. That date fell on a Sunday this year, so Mr. Obama's public inauguration was moved to Monday, a day that coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

With his hand on Bibles used by Dr. King and President Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Obama was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts at about 11:50 a.m. on the Capitol steps. His wife, Michelle Obama, and their two daughters stood at his side, as congressional leaders, cabinet secretaries and former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter sat nearby.

Vice President Joe Biden, who was officially sworn in Sunday by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, also took a ceremonial oath Monday.

An inauguration official said one million people attended the ceremony but declined to say how organizers arrived at that number. Law-enforcement officials didn't release crowd estimates, but the region's subway authority said 675,000 people had used the system, about 70% of the number for the 2009 inauguration. Many used other forms of transportation to reach the events.

Mr. Obama's speech came at a time of continued economic struggle -- at 7.8%, the U.S. unemployment rate is the same as in January 2009, after peaking at 10% during the president's first term.

Mr. Obama, who took office facing two wars, made scant mention of foreign policy, a contrast from his first inaugural address, which was largely a repudiation of former-President George W. Bush's handling of foreign affairs.

Instead, Mr. Obama on Monday promoted a list of domestic goals favored by liberals, including equal pay for women, expanded voting rights and a shift to sustainable energy sources. He also became the first president to explicitly promote gay rights during an inaugural address.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who has been a sharp White House critic, congratulated Mr. Obama but made clear the two parties have different agendas.

""The president's second term represents a fresh start when it comes to dealing with the great challenges of our day; particularly, the transcendent challenge of unsustainable federal spending and debt,"" Mr. McConnell said in a statement.

Mr. Obama's second inauguration was lower key than his first, but he appeared affected by the ceremony. As he left the podium to walk back into the Capitol, he turned to look out at the cheering crowd, remarking that he wanted to take in the scene once more because he wouldn't get to see it again.

Later, Mr. Obama joined members of Congress and other dignitaries for a lunch before participating in the traditional inaugural parade from the Capitol to the White House. Mr. Obama and the first lady stepped out of the presidential limousine to walk along a stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue, drawing cheers from the crowd. Supporters chanted ""Obama"" and ""Four more years!""

In the evening, Mr. and Mrs. Obama were to attend two balls. At the Commander-in-Chief Ball, for military service members, they danced their first dance to ""Let's Stay Together,"" performed by Jennifer Hudson.","Barack Hussein Obama ceremonially opened his second term on Monday with an assertive Inaugural Address that offered a robust articulation of modern liberalism in America, arguing that ""preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.""

On a day that echoed with refrains from the civil rights era and tributes to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Obama dispensed with the post-partisan appeals of four years ago to lay out a forceful vision of advancing gay rights, showing more tolerance toward illegal immigrants, preserving the social welfare safety net and acting to stop climate change.

At times he used his speech, delivered from the West Front of the Capitol, to reprise arguments from the fall campaign, rebutting the notion expressed by conservative opponents that America risks becoming ""a nation of takers"" and extolling the value of proactive government in society. Instead of declaring the end of ""petty grievances,"" as he did taking the oath as the 44th president in 2009, he challenged Republicans to step back from their staunch opposition to his agenda.

""Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-old debates about the role of government for all time -- but it does require us to act in our time,"" he said in the 18-minute address. ""For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act.""

Mr. Obama used Abraham Lincoln's Bible, as he did four years ago, but this time added Dr. King's Bible as well to mark the holiday honoring the civil rights leader. He became the first president ever to mention the word ""gay"" in an Inaugural Address as he equated the drive for same-sex marriage to the quests for racial and gender equality.

The festivities at the Capitol came a day after Mr. Obama officially took the oath in a quiet ceremony with his family at the White House on the date set by the Constitution. With Inauguration Day falling on a Sunday, the swearing-in was then repeated for an energized mass audience a day later, accompanied by the pomp and parade that typically surround the quadrennial tradition.

Hundreds of thousands of people gathered on a brisk but bright day, a huge crowd by any measure, though far less than the record turnout four years ago. If the day felt restrained compared with the historic mood the last time, it reflected a more restrained moment in the life of the country. The hopes and expectations that loomed so large with Mr. Obama's taking the office in 2009, even amid economic crisis, have long since faded into a starker sense of the limits of his presidency.

Now 51 and noticeably grayer, Mr. Obama appeared alternately upbeat and reflective. When he re-entered the Capitol at the conclusion of the ceremony, he stopped his entourage to turn back toward the cheering crowds on the National Mall.

""I want to take a look, one more time,"" he said. ""I'm not going to see this again.""

If the president was wistful, his message was firm. He largely eschewed foreign policy except to recommend engagement over war, and instead focused on addressing poverty and injustice at home. He did little to adopt the language of the opposition, as he has done at moments in the past, and instead directly confronted conservative philosophy.

""The commitments we make to each other -- through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security -- these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us,"" he said. ""They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.""

The phrase, ""nation of takers,"" was a direct rebuke to Republicans like Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, last year's vice-presidential nominee, and several opposition lawmakers took umbrage at the president's tone.

""I would have liked to see a little more on outreach and working together,"" said Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican who lost to Mr. Obama four years ago. ""There was not, as I've seen in other inaugural speeches, 'I want to work with my colleagues.' ""

Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, a member of the Republican leadership, said that from the opening prayer to the closing benediction, ""It was apparent our country's in chaos and what our great president has brought us is upheaval."" He added, ""We're now managing America's demise, not America's great future.""

Mr. Obama struck a more conciliatory note during an unscripted toast during lunch with Congressional leaders in Statuary Hall after the ceremony. ""Regardless of our political persuasions and perspectives, I know that all of us serve because we believe that we can make America for future generations,"" he said.

For the nation's 57th presidential inauguration, a broad section of downtown Washington was off limits to vehicles and a major bridge across the Potomac River was closed to regular traffic as military Humvees were stationed at strategic locations around the city.

Joining the president through the long day were the first lady, Michelle Obama, and their daughters, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11. The young girls were playful. Malia at one point sneaked up behind her father and cried out, ""Boo!"" Sasha used a smartphone to take a picture of her parents kissing in the reviewing stand, then made them do it again. Both girls bounced with the martial music at the Capitol.

Mr. Obama's day began with a service at St. John's Episcopal Church, across Lafayette Square from the White House, where the Rev. Andy Stanley told him to ""leverage that power for the benefit of other people in the room."" At the Capitol, Myrlie Evers-Williams, the civil rights leader, delivered the invocation and the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir performed the ""Battle Hymn of the Republic.""

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sworn in at 11:46 a.m. by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The singer James Taylor then performed ""America the Beautiful.""

At 11:50 a.m., Mr. Obama was sworn in again by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. After the two mangled the 35-word oath four years ago, necessitating a just-in-case do-over the next day, the president and chief justice this time carefully recited the words in tandem without error, although Mr. Obama did swallow the word ""states.""

Mr. Obama was more specific in discussing policy than presidents typically are in an Inaugural Address. Particularly noticeable was his recommitment to fighting climate change. ""We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,"" he said.

He referred only implicitly to terrorism, the issue that has so consumed the nation for the past decade, but offered a more inward-looking approach to foreign policy, saying that ""enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war."" He also talked of overhauling immigration rules so ""bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our work force, rather than expelled from our country.""

For a president who opposed same-sex marriage as recently as nine months ago, the speech was a clear call for gay rights, as he noted the journey ""through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall,"" symbolically linking seminal moments in the struggles for equal rights for women, blacks and gay men and lesbians.

""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,"" he said.

The expanse between the Capitol and the Washington Monument was filled with supporters, many of them African-Americans attending only the second inauguration of a black president. As large TV screens flickered in and out and the audio often warbled, the ceremony was difficult to follow for many braving the Washington chill.

The speech was followed by song, poem and benediction from Kelly Clarkson, Richard Blanco, the Rev. Luis Leon and BeyoncÃ©. The president and first lady got out of their motorcade twice to walk stretches along Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Biden and Jill Biden did as well, and the vice president greeted bystanders with fist-pumping gusto.

The two families then settled into the specially built bulletproof reviewing stand to watch the parade. Mr. Obama, who often uses Nicorette to tame an old smoking habit, was spotted chewing as the bands marched past.

In the evening, the Obamas attended two official inaugural balls, down from 10 four years ago. The president, in tuxedo with white tie, danced at each of them with the first lady, in a custom Jason Wu ruby chiffon and velvet gown, to Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together,"" performed by Jennifer Hudson. The Obamas were back at the White House by 10:15 p.m.",2013-01-22,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.979, NEU: 0.020, NEG: 0.001})",0.9790161848068237,0.019734157249331474,0.0012496592244133353,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.730, NEU: 0.265, NEG: 0.004})","AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.751, NEU: 0.246, NEG: 0.003})",0.7303720712661743,0.2651316821575165,0.004496281035244465,0.751044750213623,0.24601463973522186,0.0029406172689050436
53,53,2013-01-30-ImmigrationLaws.txt,"Well. It is good to be back in Las Vegas. And it is good to be among so many good friends.Â Let me start off by thanking everybody at Del Sol High School for hosting us.Â  Go Dragons!Â  Let me especially thank your outstanding principal, Lisa Primas. There are all kinds of notable guests here, but I just want to mention a few.Â  First of all, our outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, is here.Â Our wonderful Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar.Â  Former Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis.Â Two of the outstanding members of the congressional delegation from Nevada, Steve Horsford and Dina Titus.Â  Your own mayor, Carolyn Goodman. But we also have some mayors that flew in because they know how important the issue weâre going to talk about today is.Â  Marie Lopez Rogers from Avondale, Arizona.Â  Kasim Reed from Atlanta, Georgia.Â  Greg Stanton from Phoenix, Arizona.Â  And Ashley Swearengin from Fresno, California.Â And all of you are here, as well as some of the top labor leaders in the country.Â  And we are just so grateful.Â  Some outstanding business leaders are here as well.Â  And of course, weâve got wonderful students here, so I could not be prouder of our students. Now, those of you have a seat, feel free to take a seat.Â  I donât mind. Audience Member:Â  I love you, Mr. President! President Obama:Â  I love you back. Now, last week, I had the honor of being sworn in for a second term as President of the United States.Â And during my inaugural address, I talked about how making progress on the defining challenges of our time doesnât require us to settle every debate or ignore every difference that we may have, but it does require us to find common ground and move forward in common purpose.Â  It requires us to act. I know that some issues will be harder to lift than others.Â  Some debates will be more contentious.Â  Thatâs to be expected.Â  But the reason I came here today is because of a challenge where the differences are dwindling; where a broad consensus is emerging; and where a call for action can now be heard coming from all across America.Â  Iâm here today because the time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform.Â The time is now.Â  Now is the time.Â  Now is the time.Â  Now is the time. Audience:Â  SÃ­ se puede!Â  SÃ­ se puede! President Obama:Â  Now is the time. Iâm here because most Americans agree that itâs time to fix a system thatâs been broken for way too long.Â  Iâm here because business leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, law enforcement, and leaders from both parties are coming together to say now is the time to find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as the land of opportunity.Â  Now is the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our countryâs future. Think about it -- we define ourselves as a nation of immigrants.Â  Thatâs who we are -- in our bones.Â  The promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe, thatâs always been one of our greatest strengths.Â  It keeps our workforce young.Â  It keeps our country on the cutting edge.Â  And itâs helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known. After all, immigrants helped start businesses like Google and Yahoo!.Â  They created entire new industries that, in turn, created new jobs and new prosperity for our citizens.Â  In recent years, one in four high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants.Â  One in four new small business owners were immigrants, including right here in Nevada -- folks who came here seeking opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other Americans. But we all know that today, we have an immigration system thatâs out of date and badly broken; a system thatâs holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class. Right now, we have 11 million undocumented immigrants in America; 11 million men and women from all over the world who live their lives in the shadows.Â  Yes, they broke the rules.Â  They crossed the border illegally.Â  Maybe they overstayed their visas.Â  Those are facts.Â  Nobody disputes them.Â  But these 11 million men and women are now here.Â  Many of them have been here for years.Â  And the overwhelming majority of these individuals arenât looking for any trouble.Â  Theyâre contributing members of the community.Â  They're looking out for their families.Â  They're looking out for their neighbors.Â  They're woven into the fabric of our lives. Every day, like the rest of us, they go out and try to earn a living.Â  Often they do that in a shadow economy -- a place where employers may offer them less than the minimum wage or make them work overtime without extra pay.Â  And when that happens, itâs not just bad for them, itâs bad for the entire economy.Â  Because all the businesses that are trying to do the right thing -- that are hiring people legally, paying a decent wage, following the rules -- theyâre the ones who suffer.Â Â  They've got to compete against companies that are breaking the rules.Â  And the wages and working conditions of American workers are threatened, too. So if we're truly committed to strengthening our middle class and providing more ladders of opportunity to those who are willing to work hard to make it into the middle class, we've got to fix the system. We have to make sure that every business and every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules.Â  We have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable -- businesses for who they hire, and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law.Â  Thatâs common sense.Â  And thatâs why we need comprehensive immigration reform. Thereâs another economic reason why we need reform.Â  Itâs not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy.Â  Itâs also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so, and the effect that has on our economy. Right now, there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities.Â  Theyâre earning degrees in the fields of the future, like engineering and computer science.Â  But once they finish school, once they earn that diploma, thereâs a good chance theyâll have to leave our country.Â  Think about that. Intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.Â  Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.Â  Right now in one of those classrooms, thereâs a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea -- their Intel or Instagram -- into a big business.Â  Weâre giving them all the skills they need to figure that out, but then weâre going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else?Â  Thatâs not how you grow new industries in America.Â  Thatâs how you give new industries to our competitors.Â Â  Thatâs why we need comprehensive immigration reform. Now, during my first term, we took steps to try and patch up some of the worst cracks in the system.Â First, we strengthened security at the borders so that we could finally stem the tide of illegal immigrants.Â  We put more boots on the ground on the southern border than at any time in our history.Â  And today, illegal crossings are down nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000. Second, we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities.Â  And today, deportations of criminals is at its highest level ever. And third, we took up the cause of the DREAMers -- the young people who were brought to this country as children, young people who have grown up here, built their lives here, have futures here.Â  We said that if youâre able to meet some basic criteria like pursuing an education, then weâll consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so that you can live here and work here legally, so that you can finally have the dignity of knowing you belong. But because this change isnât permanent, we need Congress to act -- and not just on the DREAM Act.Â  We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now.Â  That's what we need. Now, the good news is that for the first time in many years, Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together.Â  Members of both parties, in both chambers, are actively working on a solution.Â  Yesterday, a bipartisan group of senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform, which are very much in line with the principles Iâve proposed and campaigned on for the last few years.Â  So at this moment, it looks like thereâs a genuine desire to get this done soon, and thatâs very encouraging. But this time, action must follow.Â  We can't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate.Â  We've been debating this a very long time.Â  So it's not as if we don't know technically what needs to get done.Â  As a consequence, to help move this process along, today Iâm laying out my ideas for immigration reform.Â  And my hope is that this provides some key markers to members of Congress as they craft a bill, because the ideas Iâm proposing have traditionally been supported by both Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Republicans like President George W. Bush.Â  You don't get that matchup very often.Â So we know where the consensus should be. Now, of course, there will be rigorous debate about many of the details, and every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process.Â  But itâs important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place.Â  And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away. So the principles are pretty straightforward.Â  There are a lot of details behind it.Â  We're going to hand out a bunch of paper so that everybody will know exactly what we're talking about.Â  But the principles are pretty straightforward. First, I believe we need to stay focused on enforcement.Â  That means continuing to strengthen security at our borders.Â  It means cracking down more forcefully on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers.Â  To be fair, most businesses want to do the right thing, but a lot of them have a hard time figuring out whoâs here legally, whoâs not.Â  So we need to implement a national system that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify someoneâs employment status.Â  And if they still knowingly hire undocumented workers, then we need to ramp up the penalties. Second, we have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally.Â  We all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship.Â  But for comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship. Weâve got to lay out a path -- a process that includes passing a background check, paying taxes, paying a penalty, learning English, and then going to the back of the line, behind all the folks who are trying to come here legally.Â  That's only fair, right? So that means it wonât be a quick process but it will be a fair process.Â  And it will lift these individuals out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn their way to a green card and eventually to citizenship. And the third principle is weâve got to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no longer reflects the realities of our time. For example, if you are a citizen, you shouldnât have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America.Â  You shouldn't have to wait years. If youâre a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology, or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors, we should help you do that here.Â  Because if you succeed, youâll create American businesses and American jobs.Â  Youâll help us grow our economy.Â  Youâll help us strengthen our middle class. So thatâs what comprehensive immigration reform looks like:Â  smarter enforcement; a pathway to earned citizenship; improvements in the legal immigration system so that we continue to be a magnet for the best and the brightest all around the world.Â  Itâs pretty straightforward. The question now is simple:Â  Do we have the resolve as a people, as a country, as a government to finally put this issue behind us?Â  I believe that we do.Â  I believe that we do.Â I believe we are finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform is within our grasp. But I promise you this:Â  The closer we get, the more emotional this debate is going to become.Â  Immigration has always been an issue that enflames passions.Â  Thatâs not surprising.Â  There are few things that are more important to us as a society than who gets to come here and call our country home; who gets the privilege of becoming a citizen of the United States of America.Â  That's a big deal. When we talk about that in the abstract, itâs easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of âusâ versus âthem.âÂ  And when that happens, a lot of folks forget that most of âusâ used to be âthem.âÂ  We forget that. Itâs really important for us to remember our history.Â  Unless youâre one of the first Americans, a Native American, you came from someplace else.Â  Somebody brought you. Ken Salazar, heâs of Mexican American descent, but he points that his family has been living where he lives for 400 years, so he didn't immigrate anywhere. The Irish who left behind a land of famine.Â  The Germans who fled persecution.Â  The Scandinavians who arrived eager to pioneer out west.Â  The Polish.Â  The Russians.Â  The Italians.Â  The Chinese.Â  The Japanese.Â  The West Indians.Â  The huddled masses who came through Ellis Island on one coast and Angel Island on the other.Â  All those folks, before they were âus,â they were âthem.âÂ Â And when each new wave of immigrants arrived, they faced resistance from those who were already here.Â  They faced hardship.Â  They faced racism.Â  They faced ridicule.Â  But over time, as they went about their daily lives, as they earned a living, as they raised a family, as they built a community, as their kids went to school here, they did their part to build a nation.Â Â They were the Einsteins and the Carnegies.Â  But they were also the millions of women and men whose names history may not remember, but whose actions helped make us who we are; who built this country hand by hand, brick by brick.Â  They all came here knowing that what makes somebody an American is not just blood or birth, but allegiance to our founding principles and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of our story. And thatâs still true today.Â  Just ask Alan Aleman.Â  Alan is here this afternoon -- where is Alan?Â  He's around here -- there he is right here.Â Alan was born in Mexico.Â  He was brought to this country by his parents when he was a child.Â  Growing up, Alan went to an American school, pledged allegiance to the American flag, felt American in every way -- and he was, except for one:Â  on paper. In high school, Alan watched his friends come of age -- driving around town with their new licenses, earning some extra cash from their summer jobs at the mall.Â  He knew he couldnât do those things.Â  But it didnât matter that much.Â  What mattered to Alan was earning an education so that he could live up to his God-given potential. Last year, when Alan heard the news that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows -- even if it's just for two years at a time -- he was one of the first to sign up.Â  And a few months ago he was one of the first people in Nevada to get approved.Â  In that moment, Alan said, âI felt the fear vanish.Â  I felt accepted.âÂ So today, Alan is in his second year at the College of Southern Nevada.Â Alan is studying to become a doctor.Â He hopes to join the Air Force.Â  Heâs working hard every single day to build a better life for himself and his family.Â  And all he wants is the opportunity to do his part to build a better America. So in the coming weeks, as the idea of reform becomes more real and the debate becomes more heated, and there are folks who are trying to pull this thing apart, remember Alan and all those who share the same hopes and the same dreams.Â  Remember that this is not just a debate about policy.Â  Itâs about people.Â  Itâs about men and women and young people who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story.Â Â Throughout our history, that has only made our nation stronger.Â  And itâs how we will make sure that this century is the same as the last:Â  an American century welcoming of everybody who aspires to do something more, and who is willing to work hard to do it, and is willing to pledge that allegiance to our flag.Â Â Thank you.Â  God bless you.Â  And God bless the United States of America.","President Barack Obama on Tuesday said he was encouraged by a plan put forth by prominent senators in both parties that would overhaul immigration laws while Republican Sen. Marco Rubio worked to persuade conservatives in his own party to embrace that plan.

""For the first time in many years, Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together,"" Mr. Obama told supporters in Las Vegas, in describing the set of principles released Monday by eight senators.

But he cautioned that the path would get tougher as the legislative process advanced, and said he would release his own proposal, already drafted, if the process became bogged down in Congress.

Mr. Obama's role in the immigration debate so far is calibrated to generate excitement among supporters while trying to avoid alienating Republicans who may be hesitant to back legislation if it is too closely identified with him. ""We have to pass this in a bipartisan way,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), one of the senators working on the issue. ""He's giving the Republicans their space.""

At the same time, Mr. Obama's 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, planned to email supporters to rally them on immigration. He said a newly-created arm of the campaign, Organizing for Action, would try to engage grass-roots supporters and get them to call lawmakers.

Mr. Obama laid out his own set of principles to guide an immigration-law overhaul, which was largely similar to the Senate framework. Both seek new border security measures, a tougher employer-verification system and a path to citizenship for the 11 million people now in the country illegally. Mr. Obama also agreed with Republicans who said newly legal immigrants shouldn't qualify for subsidies under the 2010 health-care law.

But there were key differences. The biggest: The Senate framework wouldn't allow people to qualify for citizenship until unspecified improvements in border security were met and a new system was in place to track people who arrive on legal visas.

Republicans insist on that provision, but the White House explicitly rejected it. ""We're going to have a tough road ahead without that,"" a GOP Senate aide said.

Mr. Rubio, a member of the bipartisan group, promoted the Senate proposal Tuesday as a guest of radio host Rush Limbaugh, who a day earlier had derided it at length. Like many conservatives, Mr. Limbaugh had criticized the plan's mechanism for granting citizenship, calling it ""amnesty"""" for lawbreakers.

Mr. Rubio emphasized that the proposal would make citizenship contingent on stricter enforcement rules. ""If there is not language in this bill that guarantees nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place, I won't support it,"" Mr. Rubio told Mr. Limbaugh.

By the end of the interview, Mr. Rubio appeared to have made headway with Mr. Limbaugh, who told his guest: ""What you are doing is admirable and noteworthy. You are recognizing reality."" The radio host questioned, however, whether Mr. Obama would go along with the principles Mr. Rubio laid out.

In reaching out to conservative Republicans, Mr. Rubio is doing something that other GOP senators backing the framework cannot. Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have both worked on the issue much longer than Mr. Rubio has and say similar things about it. But many conservatives don't trust them, partly because they have worked with Democrats in the past on this and other issues.

Mr. Rubio, by contrast, came to national prominence backed by the tea party. Still, as a potential 2016 presidential candidate, he is taking a risk in backing a bill that includes relief for those in the U.S. illegally. ""It takes a lot of guts, someone in his position, to go on all the conservative talk shows and make the case,"" Mr. Schumer said.","Seizing an opening to rewrite the nation's immigration laws, President Obama challenged Congress on Tuesday to act swiftly to put 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States on a clear path to citizenship.

But his push for speedy action and his silence on proposals to defer the opportunity for legal residency until the country's borders are deemed secure provoked criticism from a Republican leader on the issue. The response suggests that reaching consensus on immigration law changes remained difficult despite a new bipartisan push since the November elections.

Speaking at a high school here in a state that has seen rapid growth in its Hispanic population, the president praised a bipartisan group of senators who proposed their own sweeping immigration overhaul a day earlier, saying their plan was very much in line with his own proposals.

Mr. Obama warned, however, that ""the closer we get, the more emotional this debate is going to become."" He said that if Congress did not move forward ""in a timely fashion"" on its own legislation, he would send up a specific measure -- something the White House has put off for now -- and demand a vote.

The president's speech immediately exposed potential fault lines in the coming debate. He said, for example, that there must be a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants ""from the outset,"" a statement that would seem at odds with the assertion by some senators that citizenship must be tied to tighter border security.

Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican seen as an influential party voice on an issue that cost Republicans in last year's voting, said he was ""concerned by the president's unwillingness to accept significant enforcement triggers before current undocumented immigrants can apply for a green card.""

""Without such triggers in place,"" he went on, ""enforcement systems will never be implemented, and we will be back in just a few years dealing with millions of new undocumented people in our country.""

Although Mr. Obama did not say it in his speech, the White House is also proposing that the United States treat same-sex couples the same as other families, meaning that people would be able to use their relationship as a basis to obtain a visa -- another element likely to be resisted by some conservative Republicans.

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner, said in a statement that House Republicans ""hope the president is careful not to drag the debate to the left and ultimately disrupt the difficult work that is ahead in the House and Senate.""

A senior administration official said the speech was the start of a concerted campaign to force Republicans to follow through on the bipartisan proposal. He predicted that given the president's popularity with Hispanic voters, they would find it hard vote down a bill with his name on it.

Mr. Obama offered a familiar list of proposals: tightening security on borders, cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants and temporarily issuing more visas to clear the huge backlog of people applying for legal status in the country.

His speech, on the heels of the bipartisan Senate proposal, sets the terms for one of the year's landmark legislative debates. These are only the opening steps in a complicated dance, and both the politics and the policy can be treacherous ground, as shown by the failed effort to overhaul immigration laws in the George W. Bush administration.

But the flurry of activity underscores the powerful new momentum behind an overhaul of the system, after an election that dramatized the vulnerability of Republicans on the issue, with Mr. Obama piling up lopsided majorities over Mitt Romney among Hispanic voters.

""Most Americans agree that it's time to fix a system that's been broken for way too long,"" Mr. Obama said to an audience of about 2,000 high school students, many of them Hispanic. They applauded loudly when he mentioned the Dream Act, which offers amnesty to children of immigrants who are in the United States illegally.

In scrambling to present their blueprint on Monday, the day before Mr. Obama's speech, the senators stole a march on the president. But their intent appeared less to undermine his efforts than to stake out their own role in drafting a comprehensive bill.

""It is a fascinating Washington horse race that you don't always see, and a signal of the seriousness to get across the finish line,"" said Angela Kelley, an expert on immigration at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group.

With the senators hoping to pass legislation by this summer, the White House has shelved, for now, plans to introduce its own immigration bill, officials said. Indeed, after two years of feuding with Congress, Mr. Obama finds himself in rare alignment with Democratic and Republican lawmakers on at least the need to address a major issue.

That is what made Mr. Obama's speech such a novelty: rather than criticize Congress as do-nothing and obstructionist, as he did nearly every day during the campaign, he applauded the lawmakers for racing ahead of him, at least for a day.

Beneath the expressions of harmony, however, Ms. Kelley cautioned: ""There's so much they don't agree on. There's going to be a lot of soul-searching.""

Among the main differences is whether to make the path to citizenship for illegal immigrants contingent on stricter border controls and visa procedures.

Mr. Obama, in his remarks, emphasized that as long as immigrants registered with the authorities and fulfilled other obligations like paying their taxes, there should be no doubt that they would eventually obtain citizenship.

""If you're able to meet some basic criteria,"" he said, ""then we'll consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows.""

Mr. Obama defended his record in securing the borders, saying that illegal border crossings had dropped 80 percent from their peak in 2000 because of increased patrols. Six unmanned surveillance drones now fly over the southwest border, in addition to 124 other aircraft.

Mr. Obama's remarks differed little from the main points in his 29-page blueprint for overhauling immigration laws, which he issued last May and used as a plank in his re-election campaign. But his language was plainer and more forceful -- speaking of a road to citizenship for illegal immigrants, for example, not merely to legal status.

The provision on same-sex couples was not in the blueprint, though an administration official said the Department of Homeland Security began using it in 2010 when deciding cases involving families.

The president's goal, the officials said, will be less to underline differences with the bipartisan plan than to marshal public support behind comprehensive immigration legislation. Mr. Obama, having failed to achieve that in his first term, has put it at the top of his agenda for his second.",2013-01-30,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.993, NEU: 0.006, NEG: 0.002})",0.9927062392234802,0.005640997551381588,0.001652711653150618,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.550, NEU: 0.447, NEG: 0.004})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.843, NEG: 0.089, POS: 0.069})",0.549615204334259,0.4465664029121399,0.0038183738943189383,0.06861866265535355,0.842833936214447,0.08854739367961884
54,54,2013-02-13-StateOfTheUnion.txt,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, fellow citizens: Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this chamber that âthe Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress.â Â âIt is my task,â he said, âto report the State of the Union -- to improve it is the task of us all.â Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report. Â After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home. Â After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. Â We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in 20. Â Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before. So, together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger. But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Â Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many people still canât find full-time employment. Â Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs -- but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged. It is our generationâs task, then, to reignite the true engine of Americaâs economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class. It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, or who you love. It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation. The American people donât expect government to solve every problem. Â They donât expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. Â But they do expect us to put the nationâs interests before party. Â They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. Â For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together, and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all. Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget -- decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery. Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. Â As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances. Now we need to finish the job. Â And the question is, how? In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldnât agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollarsâ worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year. Â These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness. Â Theyâd devastate priorities like education, and energy, and medical research. Â They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs. Â Thatâs why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as the sequester, are a really bad idea. Now, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare and Social Security benefits. Â That idea is even worse. Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population. Â And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations. But we canât ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful. Â We wonât grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters. Â Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- understand that we canât just cut our way to prosperity. Â They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share. Â And thatâs the approach I offer tonight. On Medicare, Iâm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs. Â And the reforms Iâm proposing go even further. Â Weâll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.Â  Weâll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldnât be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive. Â And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they donât violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. Â Our government shouldnât make promises we cannot keep -- but we must keep the promises weâve already made. To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and the well-connected. Â After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks? Â How is that fair? Â Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing some loopholes? Â How does that promote growth? Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.Â  We can get this done. Â The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring -- a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants canât work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America. Â Thatâs what tax reform can deliver. Â Thatâs what we can do together. I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy. Â The politics will be hard for both sides. Â None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. Â But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. Â So letâs set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. Â And letâs do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. Â The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. Â We can't do it. Letâs agree right here, right now to keep the peopleâs government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Â The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another. Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda. Â But letâs be clear, deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. Â Â A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs -- that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Â Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: Â How do we attract more jobs to our shores? Â How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs? Â And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs. Â And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda. Â I urge this Congress to pass the rest. Â But tonight, Iâll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Â Let me repeat -- nothing Iâm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. Â It is not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth. Â That's what we should be looking for. Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing. Â After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Â Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Â Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. Â And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again. There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. Â Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. Â A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. Â Thereâs no reason this canât happen in other towns. So tonight, Iâm announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. Â And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America. Â We can get that done. Now, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas. Â Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy -- every dollar. Â Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimerâs. Â Theyâre developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful. Â Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Â Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race. Â We need to make those investments. Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. Â After years of talking about it, weâre finally poised to control our own energy future. Â We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar -- with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it. Â We produce more natural gas than ever before -- and nearly everyoneâs energy bill is lower because of it. Â And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen. But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. Â Now, itâs true that no single event makes a trend. Â But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Â Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods -- all are now more frequent and more intense. Â We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Â Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before itâs too late. Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth. Â I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. Â But if Congress wonât act soon to protect future generations, I will. Â I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy. Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it. Â And weâve begun to change that. Â Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. Â So letâs generate even more. Â Solar energy gets cheaper by the year -- letâs drive down costs even further. As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy, so must we. Now, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. Â We need to encourage that. Â And thatâs why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. Thatâs got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan. Â But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water. In fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. Â So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good. Â If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. Â Letâs take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices weâve put up with for far too long. Iâm also issuing a new goal for America: Â Letâs cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years. Â We'll work with the states to do it. Â Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen. Americaâs energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair. Â Ask any CEO where theyâd rather locate and hire -- a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and Internet; high-tech schools, self-healing power grids. Â The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina -- said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, theyâll bring even more jobs. Â And thatâs the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world. Â And I know you want these job-creating projects in your district. Â Iâve seen all those ribbon-cuttings. So tonight, I propose a âFix-It-Firstâ program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers donât shoulder the whole burden, Iâm also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: Â modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children. Â Letâs prove that thereâs no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and letâs start right away. Â We can get this done. And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector. Â The good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007. Â Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years. Â Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again. But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Â Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no. Â Thatâs holding our entire economy back. Â We need to fix it. Right now, thereâs a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at todayâs rates. Â Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send me that bill. Â Why would we be against that? Â Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance? Â Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home. Â Whatâs holding us back? Â Letâs streamline the process, and help our economy grow. These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing -- all these things will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs. Â But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs. And that has to start at the earliest possible age. Â Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road. Â But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Â Most middle-class parents canât afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool. Â And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives. Â So tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America. Â That's something we should be able to do. Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than seven dollars later on -- by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime. Â In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own. Â We know this works. Â So letâs do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Letâs give our kids that chance. Letâs also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job. Â Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges. Â So those German kids, they're ready for a job when they graduate high school. Â They've been trained for the jobs that are there. Â Now at schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of New York and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate's degree in computers or engineering. We need to give every American student opportunities like this. And four years ago, we started Race to the Top -- a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year. Â Tonight, Iâm announcing a new challenge to redesign Americaâs high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. Â And weâll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering and math -- the skills todayâs employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future. Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education. Â Itâs a simple fact the more education youâve got, the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class. Â But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt. Through tax credits, grants and better loans, weâve made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years. Â But taxpayers canât keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education. Â Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and itâs our job to make sure that they do. So tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid.Â  And tomorrow, my administration will release a new âCollege Scorecardâ that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria -- where you can get the most bang for your educational buck. Now, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the education and training that todayâs jobs require. Â But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone whoâs willing to work -- everybody whoâs willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead. Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants. Â And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities -- they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Â Now is the time to do it. Â Now is the time to get it done. Â Now is the time to get it done. Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress my administration has already made -- putting more boots on the Southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years. Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship -- a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally. And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy. In other words, we know what needs to be done. Â And as we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts. Â So letâs get this done. Â Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away. Â And America will be better for it. Â Letâs get it done. Â Letâs get it done. But we canât stop there. Â We know our economy is stronger when our wives, our mothers, our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence. Â Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago. Â And I now urge the House to do the same. Â Good job, Joe. Â And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year. We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest dayâs work with honest wages. Â But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year. Â Even with the tax relief we put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. Â Thatâs wrong. Â Thatâs why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher. Tonight, letâs declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.Â  We should be able to get that done. This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families. Â It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead. Â For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. Â And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government. Â In fact, working folks shouldnât have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher. Â So hereâs an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year -- letâs tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on. Tonight, letâs also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead. Â Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up. Â Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job. Â America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. Â And thatâs why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them. Letâs offer incentives to companies that hire Americans whoâve got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore. Letâs put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods. Â And this year, my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet. Â Weâll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, and education, and housing. Weâll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. Â And weâll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and do more to encourage fatherhood -- because what makes you a man isnât the ability to conceive a child; itâs having the courage to raise one. Â And we want to encourage that. Â We want to help that. Stronger families. Â Stronger communities. Â A stronger America. Â It is this kind of prosperity -- broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class -- that has always been the source of our progress at home. Â Itâs also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world. Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us. Â Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda. Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women. Â This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead. Â Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. Â This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over. Beyond 2014, Americaâs commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. Â We're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions -- training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates. Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. Â It's true, different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. Â The threat these groups pose is evolving. Â But to meet this threat, we donât need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations. Â Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen, and Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali. Â And where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans. Now, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. Â That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts. Â Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts. Â I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word for it that weâre doing things the right way. Â So in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world. Of course, our challenges donât end with al Qaeda. Â America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the worldâs most dangerous weapons. Â The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations. Â Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats. Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. At the same time, weâll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands -- because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations. America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks. Â Now, we know hackers steal peopleâs identities and infiltrate private emails. Â We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. Â Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems. Â We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy. And thatâs why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy. But now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks. Â This is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis. Now, even as we protect our people, we should remember that todayâs world presents not just dangers, not just threats, it presents opportunities. Â To boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. Â And tonight, Iâm announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union -- because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs. We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all -- not only because it creates new markets, more stable order in certain regions of the world, but also because itâs the right thing to do. Â In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day. Â So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy; by empowering women; by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve, and helping communities to feed, and power, and educate themselves; by saving the worldâs children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation, which is within our reach. You see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change. Â I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon, in Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, âThere is justice and law in the United States. Â I want our country to be like that.â In defense of freedom, weâll remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia. Â In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy. We know the process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt, but we can -- and will -- insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people. Â Weâll keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian. Â And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace. These are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month. Â And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk â- our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. Â As long as Iâm Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known. We'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending. Â We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers, and equal benefits for their families -- gay and straight. We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat. We will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors -- supporting our military families; giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned. Â And I want to thank my wife, Michelle, and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us. Thank you, honey. Â Thank you, Jill. Defending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone. Â We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home. Â That includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy: Â the right to vote. When any American, no matter where they live or what their party, are denied that right because they canât afford to wait for five or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals. So tonight, Iâm announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America. Â And it definitely needs improvement. Â Iâm asking two long-time experts in the field -- who, by the way, recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romneyâs campaign -- to lead it. Â We can fix this, and we will. Â The American people demand it, and so does our democracy. Of course, what Iâve said tonight matters little if we donât come together to protect our most precious resource: Â our children. Â It has been two months since Newtown. Â I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. Â But this time is different. Â Overwhelming majorities of Americans -- Americans who believe in the Second Amendment -- have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Â Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Â Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, theyâre tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned. Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. Â Now, if you want to vote no, thatâs your choice. Â But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun -- more than a thousand. One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. Â She was 15 years old. Â She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. Â She was a majorette. Â She was so good to her friends they all thought they were her best friend. Â Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration. Â And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house. Hadiyaâs parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. Â They deserve a vote. Â They deserve a vote. Â Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. Â The families of Newtown deserve a vote. Â The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence â- they deserve a simple vote. Â They deserve a simple vote. Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country. Â In fact, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges Iâve outlined tonight. Â But we were never sent here to be perfect. Â We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government. We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country. Â We should follow their example. We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez. Â When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she wasnât thinking about how her own home was faring. Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe. We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor. Â When Desiline arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours. Â And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say. Â And hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line to support her -- because Desiline is 102 years old. Â And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read, âI voted.â We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy. Â When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety. Â He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside, even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds. Â And when asked how he did that, Brian said, âThatâs just the way weâre made.â Thatâs just the way weâre made. Â We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us. Â But as Americans, we all share the same proud title -- we are citizens. Â Itâs a word that doesnât just describe our nationality or legal status. Â It describes the way weâre made. Â It describes what we believe. Â It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story. Thank you. Â God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.","President Barack Obama outlined an ambitious agenda in his State of the Union address Tuesday that included raising the minimum wage, increasing spending on infrastructure, attacking climate change and passing gun-control legislation.

Mr. Obama repeated his earlier calls for reducing the budget deficit through a mix of tax increases and spending cuts. He also said he would support ""modest reforms"" in programs including Medicare, as long as wealthy Americans contribute as well. And he said he would reduce troop levels in Afghanistan by half over the next year, an acceleration of the U.S. departure and an effort to wind down America's longest war.

In a speech largely focused on the economy, the president's rollout of his second-term agenda included many proposals aimed at helping low-income Americans advance. He urged Congress to work with states to provide ""high quality"" preschool to all low- and moderate-income 4-year-olds, and he proposed raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour, up from $7.25 today.

""It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation,"" Mr. Obama said.

Reopening a fight with Congress that he lost in his first term, he called for tens of billions in spending to rebuild the nation's aging roads and bridges. He also said he would work toward a comprehensive trade agreement with the European Union -- an effort that would face considerable obstacles, such as more stringent European regulations compared with U.S. rules. But Mr. Obama said a deal would support ""good-paying"" jobs.

Mr. Obama, addressing a Congress riven by disputes over how to rein in budget deficits, rejected broad changes to Medicare, the federal health program, as some Republicans have proposed. The president, who won an increase in tax rates on high wage-earners earlier this year, said he would press for deficit reduction by ending tax breaks and deductions for wealthier Americans, as well as for spending cuts.

His hourlong speech demonstrated the wide ideological gulf between the parties, even as Republicans work to reposition themselves after the 2012 presidential election defeat by taking pains to show they are attuned to the struggles of low-income and middle-class Americans.

In the Republican Party's formal response, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said the president was wrongly relying on government, rather than the free market, to boost the middle class.

""Presidents in both parties -- from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan -- have known that our free-enterprise economy is the source of our middle-class prosperity,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""But President Obama? He believes it's the cause of our problems.""

Mr. Rubio said Mr. Obama had an ""obsession with raising taxes"" and relied on deficit spending, which he contended would hurt middle-class families. ""Mr. President, I don't oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich,"" he said. ""I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors.""

Mindful of the long odds of passing a broad legislative package, Mr. Obama is pledging to use his executive powers when necessary and maximize his leverage by taking his case directly to voters.

He said he wanted Congress to act to curb global climate change. Should lawmakers balk, he said he would take action on his own authority.

""I will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy,"" Mr. Obama said.

Under Mr. Obama, the Environmental Protection Agency is already moving to regulate emissions for new power plants. Talk of further executive actions was seen by environmentalists as a signal that he will pursue a similar course for existing plants, which would mark a significant regulatory expansion.

In the speech, Mr. Obama detailed policy goals that have been dormant for years. As a presidential candidate in 2008, Mr. Obama proposed increasing the federal minimum wage to $9.50 an hour, but he has put little force behind the proposal since then.

""Tonight, let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour,"" he said.

Mr. Obama had made public works projects the centerpiece of a jobs plan he unveiled in 2011. He couldn't get it passed in Congress. Trying again, he is calling for $50 billion program that would address problems such as the 70,000 bridges in the U.S. that have been deemed structurally deficient.

Many of Mr. Obama's initiatives will require congressional action at a time when the White House has already given lawmakers a heavy workload. He wants lawmakers to pass a sweeping immigration overhaul and new limits on guns. On Tuesday, he again urged action on both fronts but didn't expand on his views about what he would like to see in legislation.

Mr. Obama cited victims of gun violence in the House chamber as he asked Congress to vote on his gun-control proposals. They would expand background checks to include all gun-buyers and bans on certain semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Present for the speech were families of the victims of the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., as well as former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who survived a gunshot to the head in 2011 and has emerged as an advocate for new gun limits.

Also in the House chamber were the parents of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was shot and killed in Chicago days after participating in the Obama inaugural celebration.

With memories of long lines at polling places still fresh, the president announced creation of a commission to study ways to cut wait times.

The new panel will have a bipartisan cast: the chairmen will be former Obama White House counsel Bob Bauer and Ben Ginsberg, an attorney for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign who was on George W. Bush's election-law team during the 2000 Florida recount.

Republicans said Mr. Obama's speech did little to build bridges across the aisle, serving as more evidence of the president's second-term strategy of adopting a more-confrontational stance toward the GOP. They also voiced skepticism about his promise that his new policies wouldn't add to the deficit.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) said Mr. Obama's policies would hurt both the government's bottom line and the nation's character. ""The president's policies are creating dependency and poverty,"" he said. ""No longer can we measure compassion by how much we spend on poverty but how many people we help to lift out of poverty.""

Mr. Obama spent time in the speech sketching his approach to dealing with al Qaeda and its allies in Afghanistan and around the world. He said he would build partnerships with other countries to avoid sending American troops, but he signaled the likelihood of continuing U.S. strikes against ""those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.""

Mr. Obama also acknowledged the growing national debate over his administration's use of drones and targeted killing. In doing so, he promised greater transparency and an effort to provide a ""legal framework"" for U.S. counterterrorism efforts.

Members of Congress have begun discussing establishment of a special court that could review proposed counterterrorism strikes. Mr. Obama didn't address the court proposal but signaled he is willing to work with Congress to expand oversight.

""No one should just take my word that we're doing things the right way,"" Mr. Obama said, calling for a system that is ""consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances.""

Mr. Obama also referred to North Korea's latest nuclear test, saying that ""provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them,"" and he promised to ""lead the world in taking firm action"" that he didn't describe.

At the same time, Mr. Obama said he would ""engage Russia"" in an effort to make further reductions in nuclear stockpiles.","President Obama, seeking to put the prosperity and promise of the middle class at the heart of his second-term agenda, called on Congress on Tuesday night to raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, saying that would lift millions out of poverty and energize the economy.

In an assertive State of the Union address that fleshed out the populist themes of his inauguration speech, Mr. Obama declared it was ""our generation's task"" to ""reignite the true engine of America's economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class.""

""Every day,"" he said, ""we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills to get those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?""

The increase in the minimum wage, from $7.25 an hour now, was the most tangible of a raft of initiatives laid out by the president, from education and energy to public works projects. Taken together, Mr. Obama said, these investments would accelerate the nation's recovery by helping those in the broad middle class.

Raising the minimum wage holds particular political appeal for younger Americans, struggling workers and labor groups, all of which were important to Mr. Obama's re-election. His proposal drew one of the loudest ovations of the evening from Democrats in the House chamber.

Speaking to a divided Congress, with many Republicans still smarting from his November victory, Mr. Obama declared, ""Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger.""

He urged lawmakers to act on immigration, climate change, budget negotiations, and, above all, on gun violence, delivering an emotional appeal for stricter controls that drew on recent tragedies like the schoolhouse massacre in Newtown, Conn.

""They deserve a vote,"" Mr. Obama declared over and over, gesturing to victims of various shootings, who were scattered through the audience.

Mr. Obama took the podium after a rousing welcome from lawmakers and other dignitaries. But millions of TV viewers, not to mention people glancing at their smartphones inside the chamber, were distracted by a manhunt across the country, where the police in California were tracking a suspect in the killing of officers and others.

News coverage concentrated on the search almost up to the point the president entered the chamber, and immediately after he finished, networks cut away to continue reporting on the events in California.

Republicans quickly rejected Mr. Obama's activist approach, saying it would inevitably translate into higher taxes and an overweening government role, strangling economic growth and deepening the nation's fiscal hole.

Still, in selecting Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American from Florida, to deliver their party's official rebuttal, Republicans implicitly acknowledged the damage they had suffered at the polls from their hard line stance on immigration. Mr. Rubio, one of the party's rising stars, favors overhauling immigration laws.

On Tuesday, he complained that Mr. Obama's ""solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more, and spend more.""

In a speech dominated by domestic issues, Mr. Obama admonished North Korea a day after it tested a nuclear weapon. He warned the country's reclusive government that it faced further isolation, swift retaliation and a United States bent on improving its own missile defense systems.

As new threats erupted, however, old threats were receding, Mr. Obama said. He announced, for example, that 34,000 troops would return home from Afghanistan by this time next year. That withdrawal, representing slightly more than half the current American force, underlined his resolve to quickly wind down the second war of his presidency.

Mr. Obama did not match the lofty tone of his inauguration speech, but the address was clearly intended to be its workmanlike companion. In place of his ringing call for a more equitable society was a package of proposals that constitute a blueprint for the remainder of his presidency. Some would require legislation; others merely an executive order.

Among the proposals was a $1 billion investment to create 15 institutes to develop new manufacturing technologies, building on the success of a pilot project in Youngstown, Ohio. He said he would use oil and gas royalties from federal lands to pay for research in clean energy technology that would wean cars and trucks off oil.

Mr. Obama pledged to work with states to provide high-quality preschool to every child in America. And he recycled a proposal to help homeowners refinance their mortgages.

None of these proposals, Mr. Obama said, would add to the deficit, since they were consistent with the budget deal of 18 months ago. ""It's not a bigger government we need,"" he said, ""but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.""

Mr. Obama also signaled, however, that the era of single-minded deficit-cutting should end. He noted that the recent agreements on taxes and spending reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion, more than halfway toward the $4 trillion in reductions that economists say would put the nation's finances on a sustainable course.

Mr. Obama spoke darkly of the consequences of a failure to reach a budget deal, which would set off automatic spending cuts on the military and other programs. ""These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness,"" he said.

On climate change, Mr. Obama endorsed the cap-and-trade legislation once championed by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, but long stalled in Congress. Though the president said he would not hesitate to use executive orders to push his own measures to reduce carbon emissions, he did not give any details.

In another sign of the election's lingering shadow, Mr. Obama was creating a bipartisan commission to investigate voting irregularities that led to long lines at polling sites in November. Studies indicate that these lines cost Democrats hundreds of thousands of votes. The commission will be led by the chief counsel of the Obama presidential campaign, Robert Bauer, and a legal adviser to Mitt Romney's campaign, Ben Ginsberg.

On trade policy, the president said that the United States and the European Union were ready to begin negotiations on a comprehensive trade treaty. That came after a report submitted earlier in the day concluded that the gaps between the two sides were narrow enough to put a deal within reach.

The most impassioned parts of the speech echoed those that Mr. Obama delivered on the west front of the Capitol three weeks ago.

""It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country,"" he said. ""The idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love.""

""It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few,"" he continued. ""That it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation of ours.""

Children loomed large on Tuesday night. In addition to a teacher from Sandy Hook Elementary School, the guests included the parents of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old high school student whose shooting death in Chicago has become an emblem of the grim toll of gun violence.

""She was 15 years old,"" Mr. Obama said of Ms. Pendleton, in words that briefly transcended the political bromides and policy prescriptions of these speeches. ""She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend.""",2013-02-13,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.965, NEU: 0.033, NEG: 0.001})",0.9650101065635681,0.033490028232336044,0.0014998428523540497,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.655, NEU: 0.340, NEG: 0.006})","AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.899, NEU: 0.100, NEG: 0.002})",0.6545029282569885,0.3399554193019867,0.005541730672121048,0.8986670970916748,0.09968693554401398,0.0016459543257951736
55,55,2013-04-16-BostonMarathon.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody.Â  Earlier today, I was briefed by my homeland security team on the events in Boston. Weâre continuing to monitor and respond to the situation as it unfolds.Â  And Iâve directed the full resources of the federal government 1  to help state and local authorities protect our people, increase security around the United States as necessary, and investigate what happened. The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight.Â  And Michelle and I send our deepest thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims in the wake of this senseless loss. We donât yet have all the answers.Â  But we do know that multiple people have been wounded, some gravely, in explosions at the Boston Marathon. Iâve spoken to FBI Director Mueller and Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano, and theyâre mobilizing the appropriate resources to investigate and to respond. Iâve updated leaders of Congress in both parties, and we reaffirmed that on days like this there are no Republicans or Democrats -- we are Americans, united in concern for our fellow citizens. Iâve also spoken with Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino, and made it clear that they have every single federal resource necessary to care for the victims and counsel the families.Â  And above all, I made clear to them that all Americans stand with the people of Boston. Boston police, firefighters, and first responders as well as the National Guard responded heroically, and continue to do so as we speak.Â  Itâs a reminder that so many Americans serve and sacrifice on our behalf every single day, without regard to their own safety, in dangerous and difficult circumstances.Â  And we salute all those who assisted in responding so quickly and professionally to this tragedy. We still do not know who did this or why.Â  And people shouldnât jump to conclusions before we have all the facts.Â  But make no mistake -- we will get to the bottom of this.Â  And we will find out who did this; we'll find out why they did this.Â  Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice. Today is a holiday in Massachusetts -- Patriotsâ Day.Â  Itâs a day that celebrates the free and fiercely independent spirit that this great American city of Boston has reflected from theÂ  earliest days of our nation.Â  And itâs a day that draws the world to Bostonâs streets in a spirit of friendly competition.Â  Boston is a tough and resilient town.Â  So are its people.Â  I'm supremely confident that Bostonians will pull together, take care of each other, and move forward as one proud city.Â  And as they do, the American people will be with them every single step of the way. You should anticipate that as we get more information, our teams will provide you briefings.Â  We're still in the investigation stage at this point.Â  But I just want to reiterate we will find out who did this and we will hold them accountable. Thank you very much. 1  ","Two deadly explosions ripped through a crowd at the Boston Marathon on Monday, killing at least three people and injuring about 140, once again raising the specter of terrorism on American soil.

At about 2:50 p.m., some three hours after the winners had crossed the finish line but while thousands more runners still were on the streets, two bombs exploded 50 to 100 yards apart near the course's end in the city's crowded Back Bay section, Boston Police said.

Panicked spectators fled the scene as smoke from the blasts filled the air, sirens wailed and exhausted, disoriented runners and families raced to find one another amid the mayhem.

President Barack Obama, in a brief televised address, said he would put the full resources of the government behind the investigation. ""Make no mistake. We will get to the bottom of this and we will find out who did this and we will find out why they did this,"" he said.

Mr. Obama didn't describe the explosions as a terrorist attack, saying ""we don't yet have all the answers."" But after his statement, a White House official said: ""Any event with multiple explosive devices -- as this appears to be -- is clearly an act of terror, and will be approached as an act of terror.""

Police said Monday evening they had no suspects in custody. U.S. officials said investigators were combing through video recordings and the wreckage at the scene to try to determine who placed the bombs.

Federal authorities consider it a ""potential terrorist investigation,"" Richard DesLauriers, special agent in charge of the Boston office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said at a Monday night news briefing.

It was Patriots' Day in Boston, the Massachusetts holiday commemorating the first battles of the American Revolution. Schools and offices are closed, the Red Sox play a day game and the nation's oldest and most prestigious marathon takes over the streets.

More than half the runners had crossed the finish line at the time of the blasts. Those who hadn't were diverted from the course by police about a half mile from the end, witnesses said. Some 23,000 people had started the marathon, estimated the Boston Athletic Association, its organizer.

Thom Kenney, a 43-year-old Army veteran who recently returned from Afghanistan, had just crossed the finish line when the explosions rang out. ""Most of the people were looking back at the first explosion, wondering what it was, when the second explosion went off,"" he said. ""When that went off, we all started calling our families as fast as we could.""

The explosions ""sounded like an IED -- that was the first reaction that I had,"" he said, referring to the improvised explosive devices used in Afghanistan.

Police initially reported a third explosion at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, about six miles away, then said it had been a fire in a mechanical room. But fearing more explosions or other events, authorities urged people to stay inside and avoid large crowds.

The blasts temporarily halted city's transportation system as well as flights. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered flights bound for Boston's Logan International Airport to remain at their original airports until late afternoon.

Hospitals around the city were flooded with victims bearing a range of injuries.

""These are very high-force, high-impact injuries so they cause a lot of damage to tissue and to bone,"" said Ron Walls, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Shrapnel embedded in some patients' skin seemed to be objects from the street, not from any explosive device, he said.

At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dr. Stephen Epstein, attending physician in the emergency department, said X-rays of patients showed metal balls that appeared to be ball bearings. ""They look like BBs,"" he said, adding that the balls were distinct from the shrapnel thrown up from debris on the street. Dr. Epstein said some people are at risk of losing limbs.

Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis called the bombs ""powerful devices"" but declined to describe them further. ""There was no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen,"" Mr. Davis said at a news conference.

A Justice Department official said Attorney General Eric Holder directed agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate. The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), said that ""if this is in fact a malicious attack, those responsible will be held accountable.""""

Brent Cunningham, 46, had traveled from Sitka, Alaska, to run in the marathon. ""We heard two explosions, and I thought, 'that had a 9/11 feel to it,' "" he said.

Mr. Cunningham had finished the race and was walking in Boston Common with his family when the blasts hit. ""It wasn't until we heard sirens, then we knew something had happened.""

Beth Wolniewicz, a 46-year-old Chicago resident, said she had finished the race about three minutes before the initial blast. ""I saw the first explosion. I never saw the second one go off,"" she said. ""It was loud but more staggering was the velocity of the smoke. It was rising really quickly.""

Paul Thompson, a spectator who is a sports cardiologist, has researched and published extensively about the health implications of running the Boston Marathon. Driving away from the bloody scene near the finish line Monday, Dr. Thompson couldn't speak without crying.

""For what? For what?"" said the 65-year-old. ""These people are totally innocent. They're not engaged in combat.""

A 29-time finisher of the race who first witnessed it as a child at his father's knee, Dr. Thompson said he couldn't imagine the race ever being the same. ""Unequivocally, it will change these events. It will become less fun. Less of a party. I just can't tell you how terrible I think this is.""

The London Marathon is scheduled to take place this Sunday. In a statement released by the London Marathon Twitter account, Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent Julia Pendry said of the coming race, ""We will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with London Marathon.""

Other cities across the country heightened security after the Boston explosions. New York Police Department officials activated emergency measures to protect ""hotels and other prominent locations"" in New York City, spokesman Paul Browne said Monday. Critical response vehicles were deployed to locations throughout the city ""until more about the explosion is learned,"" he said.","Two powerful bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday afternoon, killing three people, including an 8-year-old child, and injuring more than 100, as one of this city's most cherished rites of spring was transformed from a scene of cheers and sweaty triumph to one of screams and carnage.

Almost three-quarters of the 23,000 runners who participated in the race had already crossed the finish line when a bomb that had apparently been placed in a garbage can exploded around 2:50 p.m. in a haze of smoke amid a crowd of spectators on Boylston Street, just off Copley Square in the heart of the city. Thirteen seconds later, another bomb exploded several hundred feet away.

Pandemonium erupted as panicked runners and spectators scattered, and rescue workers rushed in to care for the dozens of maimed and injured, some of whom lost legs in the blast, witnesses said. The F.B.I. took the lead role in the investigation on Monday night, and Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the bureau's Boston office, described the inquiry at a news conference as ""a criminal investigation that is a potential terrorist investigation.""

The reverberations were felt far outside the city, with officials in New York and Washington stepping up security at important locations. Near the White House, the Secret Service cordoned off Pennsylvania Avenue out of what one official described as ""an abundance of caution.""

President Obama, speaking at the White House, vowed to bring those responsible for the blasts to justice. ""We will get to the bottom of this,"" the president said. ""We will find who did this, and we will find out why they did this. Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.""

Mr. Obama did not refer to the attacks as an act of terrorism, and he cautioned people from ""jumping to conclusions"" based on incomplete information. But a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity afterward, said, ""Any event with multiple explosive devices -- as this appears to be -- is clearly an act of terror, and will be approached as an act of terror.""

""However,"" the official added, ""we don't yet know who carried out this attack, and a thorough investigation will have to determine whether it was planned and carried out by a terrorist group, foreign or domestic.""

Some runners were approaching the end of the 26.2-mile race when the two blasts, in rapid succession, sent them running away from the finish line.

""The first one went off, I thought it was a big celebratory thing, and I just kept going,"" recalled Jarrett Sylvester, 26, a runner from East Boston, who said it had sounded like a cannon blast. ""And then the second one went off, and I saw debris fly in the air. And I realized it was a bomb at that point. And I just took off and ran in the complete opposite direction.""

There were conflicting reports about how many devices there were. One law enforcement official said there had been four: the two that exploded at the marathon and two others that were disabled by the police. The official said that the devices appeared to have been made with black powder and ball bearings, but that investigators were unsure how the two that exploded had been set off.

It was unclear Monday evening who might be responsible for the blast. Although investigators said that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen who was injured in the blast, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was in custody.

Some law enforcement officials noted that the blasts came at the start of a week that has sometimes been seen as significant for radical American antigovernment groups: it was the April 15 deadline for filing taxes, and Patriots' Day in Massachusetts, the start of a week that has seen violence in the past. April 19 is the anniversary of the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

The explosive devices used in the attacks on Monday were similar in size to the device used in the 1996 attack at the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta but were not nearly as large as the one used in Oklahoma City. In the Atlanta attack, a pipe bomb was detonated near pedestrians, killing 2 and injuring more than 100 -- similar numbers to Monday's attack.

The attack in Oklahoma City was far larger because the perpetrator used a truck packed with thousands of pounds of explosives. The device killed more than 150 people.

The attack on Monday occurred in areas that had been largely cleared of vehicles for the marathon. Without vehicles to pack explosives into, the perpetrators would have been forced to rely on much smaller devices.

Officials stressed that they had no suspects in the attack. The Saudi man, who was interviewed at Brigham and Women's Hospital, had been seen running from the scene of the first explosion, a person briefed on preliminary developments in the investigation said on Monday afternoon. A law enforcement official said later Monday that the man, was in the United States on a student visa and came under scrutiny because of his injuries, his proximity to the blasts and his nationality -- but added that he was not known to federal authorities and that his role in the attack, if any, was unclear.

The explosions brought life in Boston to a halt. Police officials effectively closed a large part of the Back Bay neighborhood, which surrounds the blast site; some transit stops were closed; planes were briefly grounded at Boston Logan International Airport and the Boston Symphony Orchestra canceled its Monday night concert. A Boston Celtics game scheduled for Tuesday was also canceled.

Boston was bracing for a heightened law enforcement presence on Tuesday, with its transit riders subject to random checks of their backpacks and bags, and many streets in the center of the city likely to be closed to traffic as the investigation continues. Gov. Deval Patrick said Monday night that ""the city of Boston is open and will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual.""

Boston's police commissioner, Ed Davis, urged people to stay off the streets. ""We're recommending to people that they stay home, that if they're in hotels in the area that they return to their rooms, and that they don't go any place and congregate in large crowds,"" he said at an afternoon news conference.

It had begun as a perfect day for the Boston Marathon, one of running's most storied events, with blue skies and temperatures just shy of 50 degrees. The race typically draws half a million spectators. And long after the world-class runners had finished -- the men's race was won by Lelisa Desisa Benti of Ethiopia, who finished it in 2 hours, 10 minutes and 22 seconds -- the sidewalks of Back Bay were still thick with spectators cheering on friends and relatives as they loped, exhausted, toward the finish line.

Dr. Natalie Stavas, a pediatric resident at Boston Children's Hospital, was running in the marathon with her father and was nearing the finish line when the explosions shook the street.

""The police were trying to keep us back, but I told them that I was a physician and they let me through,"" she recalled in an interview.

First she performed CPR on one woman. ""She was on the ground, she wasn't breathing, her legs were pretty much gone,"" she said, adding that she feared that the woman had not survived.

Then she tried to help a woman with an injury in her groin area, and a man who had lost his foot. Dr. Stavas said t she had applied a tourniquet to the man's leg with someone's belt. ""He was likely in shock,"" she said. ""He was saying, 'I'm O.K., doctor, I'm O.K.' ""

""Then ambulances started coming in by the dozen,"" she said.

The blast was so powerful that it blew out shop windows and damaged a window on the third floor of the Central Library in Copley Square, which was closed to the public for Patriots' Day.

A number of people were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, said Dr. Alasdair Conn, the hospital's chief of emergency services -- and several had lost their legs.

""This is like a bomb explosion we hear about in Baghdad or Israel or other tragic points in the world,"" Dr. Conn said.

Several children were among the 10 patients who were brought to Boston Children's Hospital, including a 2-year-old boy with a head injury who was admitted to the medical/surgical intensive care unit.

The police faced another problem as they tried to secure the blast scene: many spectators dropped their backpacks and bags as they scattered to safety, and investigators had to treat each abandoned bag as a potential bomb. There were bomb scares at area hotels. At one point in the afternoon, Boston police officials said that they feared that a fire at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum could have been related to the marathon bombs, but they later said it seemed to be unrelated.

The Boston police said that they were getting numerous reports of suspicious packages. Asked if they had found all the explosive devices, Mr. Davis, the police commissioner, urged citizens to remain alert and said he was ""not prepared to say we're at ease at this time.""",2013-04-16,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.834, POS: 0.156, NEG: 0.010})",0.15558624267578125,0.8339357972145081,0.01047793310135603,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.954, NEU: 0.043, POS: 0.003})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.954, NEU: 0.043, POS: 0.003})",0.002631628653034568,0.043287474662065506,0.9540809392929077,0.0028260578401386738,0.04318831488490105,0.9539856910705566
56,56,2013-04-26-BushLibrary.txt,"To President and Mrs. Bush; to President Clinton and now-former Secretary Clinton; to President George H.W. Bush and Mrs. Bush; to President and Mrs. Carter; to current and former world leaders and all the distinguished guests here today: Michelle and I are honored to be with you to mark this historic occasion.

This is a Texas-sized party. And thatâs worthy of what weâre here to do today: honor the life and legacy of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush.

When all the living former Presidents are together, itâs also a -- a special day for our democracy. Weâve been called ""the worldâs most exclusive club"" -- and we do have a pretty nice clubhouse. But the truth is, our club is more like a support group.

The last time we all got together was just before I took office -- and I needed that. Because as each of these leaders will tell you, no matter how much you may think youâre ready to assume the office of the presidency, itâs impossible to truly understand the nature of the job until itâs yours, until youâre sitting at that desk.

And thatâs why every President gains a greater appreciation for all of those who served before them; for the leaders from both parties who've taken on the momentous challenges and felt the enormous weight of the nation on their shoulders. And for me, that appreciation very much extends to President Bush.

The first thing I found in that desk the day I took office was a -- a letter from George, and one that demonstrated his compassion and his generosity. For he knew that I would come to learn what he had learned -- that being President, above all, is a humbling job. There are moments where you make mistakes.

There are times where you wish you could turn back the clock. And what I know is true about President Bush, and I hope my successor will say about me, is that we love this country and we do our best.

Now, in the past, President Bush has said itâs impossible to pass judgment on his presidency while heâs still alive. So maybe this is a little bit premature. But even now, there are certain things that we know for certain.

We know about the son who was raised by two strong, loving parents in Midland, famous -- famously inheriting, as he says, ""my daddyâs eyes and my motherâs mouth""; the young boy who once came home after a trip to a museum and proudly presented his horrified mother with a small dinosaur tailbone he had smuggled home in his pocket.

Iâll bet that went over great with Barbara.

We know about the young man who met the love of his life at a dinner party, ditching his plans to go to bed early and instead talking with the brilliant and charming Laura Welch late into the night.

We know about the father who raised two remarkable, caring, beautiful daughters, even after they tried to discourage him from running for President, saying, ""Dad, youâre not as cool as you think you are."" Mr. President, I can relate. And now we see President Bush, the grandfather, just beginning to spoil his brand-new granddaughter. 

So we know President Bush the man. And what President Clinton said is absolutely true -- to know the man is to like the man, because heâs comfortable in his own skin.  He knows who he is. He doesnât put on any pretenses. He takes his job seriously, but he doesnât take himself too seriously. He is a good man.

But we also know something about George Bush the leader. As we walk through this library, obviously weâre reminded of the incredible strength and resolve that came through that bullhorn as he stood amid the rubble and the ruins of Ground Zero, promising to deliver justice to those who had sought to destroy our way of life. 

We remember the compassion that he showed by leading the global fight against HIV/AIDS and malaria, helping to save millions of lives and reminding people in some of the poorest corners of the globe that America cares and that weâre here to help.

We remember his commitment to reaching across the aisle to unlikely allies like Ted Kennedy, because he believed that we had to reform our schools in ways that help every child learn, not just some; that we have to repair a broken immigration system; and that this progress is only possible when we do it together.

Seven years ago, President Bush restarted an important conversation by speaking with the American people about our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And even though comprehensive immigration reform has taken a little longer than any of us expected, I am hopeful that this year, with the help of Speaker Boehner and some of the senators and members of Congress who are here today, that we bring it home -- for our families, and our economy, and our security, and for this incredible country that we love. And if we do that, it will be in large part thanks to all the hard work of President George W. Bush.

And finally, a President bears no greater decision and no more solemn burden than serving as Commander-in-Chief of the greatest military that the world has ever known. As President Bush himself has said, ""America must and will keep its word to the men and women who have given us so much."" So even as we Americans may at times disagree on matters of foreign policy, we share a profound respect and reverence for the men and women of our military and their families. And we are united in our determination to comfort the families of the fallen and to care for those who wear the uniform of the United States.

On the flight back from Russia, after negotiating with Nikita Khrushchev at the height of the Cold War, President Kennedy's secretary found a small slip of paper on which the President had written a favorite saying: ""I know there is a God. And I see a storm coming. If he has a place for me, I believe I am ready."" 

No one can be completely ready for this office. But America needs leaders who are willing to face the storm head on, even as they pray for God's strength and wisdom so that they can do what they believe is right. And thatâs what the leaders with whom I share this stage have all done. Thatâs what President George W. Bush chose to do. Thatâs why I'm honored to be part of today's celebration.

Mr. President, for your service, for your courage, for your sense of humor, and, most of all, for your love of country: Thank you very much.

From all the citizens of the United States of America, God bless you.

And God bless these United States.
","Former President George W. Bush, dedicating the library and museum that will house his presidential records, said Thursday he stayed true to his core convictions during his time in the White House by lowering taxes, raising school standards and leaving foreign countries ""liberated"" from dictators.

During the dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Center on the campus of Southern Methodist University, speakers highlighted the 43rd president's ""resolve"" in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, his work in Africa and his good humor, with only passing references to the controversial decisions that marked his two terms in office.

Mr. Bush said that as president, his deepest-held conviction was that America must strive to expand the reach of freedom.

""One of the benefits of freedom is that people can disagree,"" Mr. Bush said, adding that he created plenty of opportunities for people to exercise that right.

The library's opening has prompted an examination of Mr. Bush's administration, with allies saying that many of the Republican's actions would be viewed more objectively and positively over time.

Americans' view of Mr. Bush has been improving. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this month, 35% had a positive view of him, up from 31% in January 2009, the month he left office. That compares with 47% who view President Barack Obama positively. The proportion holding a negative view of Mr. Bush declined sharply, to 44% in this month's poll from 58% in 2009.

Andrew Card, who served as Mr. Bush's chief of staff, said the museum provides context for challenges the former president confronted.

""This is really not a tribute to George W. Bush,"" he said in an interview. ""It's trying to put people in the position of being president and facing some phenomenally difficult decisions.""

The library invites debate and discussion, with an interactive exhibit that lets visitors walk through key decisions Mr. Bush faced -- including on the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and the financial crisis -- and then weigh in with what they would do.

Thursday's library dedication was the rare occasion that brought together all five living U.S. presidents: Mr. Bush; his father, George H.W. Bush; and Democrats Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and Mr. Obama.

These five presidents had gathered only once before, at the White House in 2009 after Mr. Obama was elected. Their relationships are complicated, but on Thursday, they highlighted the positive.

Mr. Obama noted that they belong to an exclusive fraternity, adding that ""our club is more like a support group.""

He has been among Mr. Bush's most vocal and persistent critics, blaming his predecessor's policies for exacerbating the financial crisis. But on Thursday, he praised Mr. Bush's willingness to reach across the aisle and his work to rewrite immigration laws -- an effort that Mr. Obama vowed to complete.

The focus on Mr. Bush's legacy comes as speculation intensifies about the possibility of another Bush presidential bid.

On Wednesday, Jeb Bush spoke in Dallas, sounding very much like a candidate as he laid out his ideas about immigration and education. His son, George P. Bush, introduced him, touting the former Florida governor's approval ratings.

But on Thursday, former first lady Barbara Bush suggested on NBC's ""Today"" show that her son shouldn't run. ""We've had enough Bushes,"" she said.

George W. Bush disagreed in an interview with ABC News, saying that his counsel to his brother was simple: ""Run.""","Standing in front of the magisterial brick-and-limestone George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on Thursday, Bill Clinton summed up the day with a knowing smile. ""I told President Obama,"" he said, ""that this was the latest, grandest example of the eternal struggle of former presidents to rewrite history.""

All five veterans of the Oval Office onstage could relate to that: If every memoirist is the star of his own story, every president is the hero of his own library.

So the protagonist who emerged as Mr. Bush's library was formally dedicated on Thursday was a resolute leader who protected the nation after Sept. 11, 2001, raised education standards, pushed to overhaul the immigration system and brought peace to the war-torn nation of Sudan. His peers highlighted his AIDS-fighting program, which is credited with saving millions of lives in Africa.

The words Iraq and Afghanistan, however, never passed Mr. Bush's lips, or those of the four other presidents who spoke.

They alluded to the American wars there by praising Mr. Bush's deep concern for wounded soldiers and the families of those killed in combat, but put aside for a day the arguments over how the wars were conducted, why they were waged and what they accomplished.

""One of the benefits of freedom is that people can disagree,"" Mr. Bush told a crowd of thousands on a bright Texas day. ""It's fair to say I created plenty of opportunities to exercise that right. But when future generations come to this library and study this administration, they're going to find out that we stayed true to our convictions.""

For Mr. Bush, 66, who has spent the past four years listening in silence as his successor has faulted his leadership, this was an emotional day. Bathed in the admiration of a friendly crowd and enjoying a modest resurgence of public appreciation in recent surveys, he choked up as he finished speaking and wiped tears from his eyes after sitting down.

While critics have fumed about what they called the whitewashing of his record in the media blitz leading up to the library dedication, many Americans have been reminded about aspects of Mr. Bush they once liked. Advisers said they hoped the moment would help history draw a fuller picture.

""It's never been about presenting him,"" said Nicolle Wallace, who worked on Mr. Bush's re-election campaign and in the White House. ""It's been about revealing him.""

The $250 million library, on the campus of Southern Methodist University, reframes many elements of the Bush presidency, domestic, economic and foreign, as part of his ""freedom agenda,"" linking together sometimes disparate policies in a single narrative thread.

""In democracy, the purpose of public office is not to fulfill personal ambition,"" Mr. Bush said. ""Elected officials must serve a cause greater than themselves. The political winds blow left and right, polls rise and fall, supporters come and go. But in the end leaders are defined by the convictions that they hold. And my deepest conviction, the guiding principle of the administration, is that the United States of America must strive to expand the reach of freedom.""

Jimmy Carter, Mr. Bush's father and Mr. Clinton have opened their own libraries, likewise shaping their histories as they preferred. Mr. Obama can be expected to do the same soon enough. On this day, they collectively wrapped their arms around a fellow member of the club.

""We know President Bush the man,"" Mr. Obama said. ""To know the man is to like the man. Because he's comfortable in his own skin. He knows who he is. He doesn't put on any pretenses. He takes his job seriously, but he doesn't take himself too seriously. He is a good man.""

Mr. Obama, whose first presidential campaign was built on opposition to the Iraq war, praised Mr. Bush for his bullhorn-in-the-rubble fortitude after Sept. 11 and said his predecessor fought for what he thought was best for his country. He linked his own effort to overhaul the immigration system to Mr. Bush's.

""If we do that, it will be in large part thanks to the hard work of President George W. Bush,"" Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Clinton, who has become close to the Bush family, offered warm words and recounted how he and Mr. Bush used to talk politics while his successor was in office. Referring to the library behind him, he joked, ""Dear God, I hope there's no record of those conversations in this vast and beautiful building."" Hillary Rodham Clinton, sitting onstage with the other presidents and first ladies, laughed robustly.

Mr. Carter, one of the fiercest critics of the Iraq war, talked about how Mr. Bush ended war in Sudan and helped Africa. ""I'm filled with admiration for you and deep gratitude for you about the contributions you've made to the most needy people on earth,"" he told Mr. Bush.

The event was a public re-emergence for Mr. Bush's father, who spent weeks in a hospital last winter and at one point appeared close to death. Now in a wheelchair because he has a form of Parkinson's disease, Mr. Bush, 88, said only a few words, thanking those who made his son's library. ""It's very special for Barbara and me,"" he said.

The crowd stood in ovation. In a poignant moment, the former president -- with the help of his son and Barbara Bush -- lifted himself to his feet for a few moments in acknowledgment.

Also on hand was former Vice President Dick Cheney, who appeared revitalized after having a heart transplant last year. Wearing a cowboy hat, Mr. Cheney was introduced along with members of presidential families, but he had no speaking role.

Mr. Cheney makes only cameo appearances in the museum exhibits, and in an interview broadcast this week, the younger Mr. Bush described their relationship as ""cordial"" -- a word that left the impression that the two were not close because of their fight in the waning days of the administration over a pardon for the vice president's former chief of staff.

Perhaps to refute that, Mr. Bush offered warm words for Mr. Cheney from the stage. ""He served with loyalty, principle and strength,"" Mr. Bush said. ""I'm proud to call you friend.""",2013-04-26,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.986, NEU: 0.013, NEG: 0.001})",0.986311137676239,0.012602172791957855,0.0010866968659684062,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.516, POS: 0.477, NEG: 0.007})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.576, POS: 0.420, NEG: 0.004})",0.4767208993434906,0.5163159966468811,0.006963040214031935,0.4202461242675781,0.5756036639213562,0.004150253254920244
57,57,2013-05-04-MexicoAddress.txt," Hola!  Buenos dias!  Please, please, everybody have a seat.  It is wonderful to be back in MÃ©xico -- lindo y querido [""lovely and beloved""]. I bring with me the greetings and friendship of the people of the United States, including tens of millions of proud Mexican Americans.

This is my fourth visit to Mexico as President.  This is my second visit to this museum.  And each time that I've come Iâve been inspired by your culture and by the beauty of this land, and most of all, by the Mexican people.  Youâve been so kind and gracious to me.  Youâve welcomed my wife, Michelle, here.  Youâve welcomed our daughter, Malia, and her classmates to Oaxaca.  And as a proud father, I have to say that Maliaâs Spanish is getting very good.  It helps that sheâs smarter than I am.
 
And itâs an honor to be back in Mexico City -- one of the worldâs great cities.  Es un placer estar entre amigos. [""It's a pleasure to be among friends.""]

And itâs fitting that we gather at this great museum, which celebrates Mexicoâs ancient civilizations and their achievements in arts and architecture, medicine and mathematics.  In modern times, Mexicoâs blend of cultures and traditions found its expression in the murals of Rivera and the paintings of Frida, and the poetry of Sor Juana and the essays of Octavio Paz.  And Paz once spoke words that capture the spirit of our gathering here today -- in this place that celebrates your past, but which this morning is filled with so many young people who will shape Mexicoâs future.  Octavio Paz said,

    Modernity is not outside us, it is within us.  It is today and the most ancient antiquity; it is tomorrow and the beginning of the world; it is a thousand years old and yet newborn.

And thatâs why I wanted this opportunity to speak with all of you today, because you live at the intersection of history that Octavio Paz was referring to.  The young people of Mexico, you honor your heritage, thousands of years old, but youâre also part of something new, a nation thatâs in the process of remaking itself.  And as our modern world changes around us, itâs the spirit of young people, your optimism and your idealism, and your willingness to discard old habits that are no longer working that will drive the world forward.
 
You see the difference between the world as it is and the world as it could to be; between old attitudes that stifle progress and the new thinking that allows us to connect and collaborate across cultures.  And by the way, that includes how we think about the relationship between Mexico and the United States.
 
Despite all the bonds and the values that we share, despite all the people who claim heritage on both sides, our attitudes sometimes are trapped in old stereotypes.  Some Americans only see the Mexico that is depicted in sensational headlines of violence and border crossings.  And letâs admit it, some Mexicans think that America disrespects Mexico, or thinks that America is trying to impose itself on Mexican sovereignty, or just wants to wall ourselves off.  And in both countries such distortions create misunderstandings that make it harder for us to move forward together.  So I've come to Mexico because I think itâs time for us to put the old mind-sets aside.  Itâs time to recognize new realities -- including the impressive progress of todayâs Mexico.

It is true that there are Mexicans all across this country who are making courageous sacrifices for the security of your country; that in the countryside and the neighborhoods not far from here, there are those who are still struggling to give their children a better life.  But whatâs also clear is that a new Mexico is emerging.

I see it in the deepening of Mexicoâs democracy, citizens who are standing up and saying that violence and impunity is not acceptable; a courageous press thatâs working to hold leaders accountable; a robust civil society, including brave defenders of human rights who demand dignity and rule of law.  You have political parties that are competing vigorously, but also transferring power peacefully, and forging compromise.  And that's all a sign of the extraordinary progress that's taken place here in Mexico.

And even though we know the work of perfecting democracy is never finished -- that's true in America, that's true here in Mexico -- you go forward knowing the truth that Benito Juarez once spoke -- âdemocracy is the destiny of humanity.â  And we are seeing that here in Mexico.  We're seeing that here in Mexico. 
 
We're also seeing a Mexico thatâs creating new prosperity:  Trading with the world.  Becoming a manufacturing powerhouse -- from Tijuana to Monterrey to Guadalajara and across the central highlands -- a global leader in automobiles and appliances and electronics, but also a center of high-tech innovation, producing the software and the hardware of our digital age.  One man in QuerÃ©taro spoke for an increasing number of Mexicans.  âThereâs no reason to go abroad in search of a better life.  There are good opportunities here.â  That's what he said, and you are an example of that.
 
And, in fact, I see a Mexico thatâs lifted millions of people from poverty.  Because of the sacrifices of generations, a majority of Mexicans now call themselves middle class, with a quality of life that your parents and grandparents could only dream of.  This includes, by the way, opportunities for women, who are proving that when you give women a chance, they will shape our destiny just as well as men, if not better.

I also see in Mexicoâs youth an empowered generation because of technology.  I think I see some of you tweeting right now -- whatâs happening.  And whether itâs harnessing social media to preserve indigenous languages, or speaking up for the future that you want, youâre making it clear that you want your voice heard.

And because of all the dynamic progress that's taking place here in Mexico, Mexico is also taking its rightful place in the world, on the world stage.  Mexico is standing up for democracy not just here in Mexico but throughout the hemisphere.  Mexico is sharing expertise with neighbors across the Americas.  When they face earthquakes or threats to their citizens, or go to the polls to cast their votes, Mexico is there, helping its neighbors.  Mexico has joined the ranks of the worldâs largest economies.  It became the first Latin American nation to host the G20.
 
Just as Mexico is being transformed, so are the ties between our two countries.  As President, Iâve been guided by a basic proposition -- in this relationship thereâs no senior partner or junior partner; we are two equal partners, two sovereign nations. We must work together in mutual interest and mutual respect.  And if we do that both Mexico and the United States will prosper.

And just as I worked with President CalderÃ³n, Iâve reaffirmed with President PeÃ±a Nieto that the great partnership between our two countries will not simply continue, itâs going to grow stronger and become broader.  In my time with President PeÃ±a Nieto, Iâve come to see his deep commitment to Mexico and its future.  And we share the belief that as leaders our guiding mission is to improve the lives of our people.  And so we agree that the relationship between our nations must be defined not by the threats that we face but by the prosperity and the opportunity that we can create together.

Now, as equal partners, both our nations must recognize our mutual responsibilities.  So here in Mexico, youâve embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to make your economy more competitive and your institutions more accountable to you, the Mexican people.  As you pursue these reforms, I want you to know that you have strong support in the United States.  Because we believe, I believe, that people all around the world deserve the best from their government.  And whether youâre looking for basic services, or trying to start a new business, we share your belief that you should be able to make it through your day without paying a bribe.  And when talented Mexicans like you imagine your future, you should have every opportunity to succeed right here in the country you love.
 
And in the United States, we recognize our responsibilities.  We understand that much of the root cause of violence that's been happening here in Mexico, for which many so Mexicans have suffered, is the demand for illegal drugs in the United States.  And so weâve got to continue to make progress on that front.

Iâve been asked, and I honestly do not believe that legalizing drugs is the answer.  But I do believe that a comprehensive approach -- not just law enforcement, but education and prevention and treatment -- that's what we have to do.  And weâre going to stay at it because the lives of our children and the future of our nations depend on it.
 
And we also recognize that most of the guns used to commit violence here in Mexico come from the United States.  I think many of you know that in America, our Constitution guarantees our individual right to bear arms, and as President I swore an oath to uphold that right and I always will.  But at the same time, as Iâve said in the United States, I will continue to do everything in my power to pass common-sense reforms that keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people.  That can save lives here in Mexico and back home in the United States. Itâs the right thing to do.  So weâll keep increasing the pressure on gun traffickers who bring illegal guns into Mexico.  Weâll keep putting these criminals where they belong -- behind bars. 

We recognize weâve got work to do on security issues, but we also recognize our responsibility -- as a nation that believes that all people are created equal -- we believe itâs our responsibility to make sure that we treat one another with dignity and respect.  And this includes recognizing how the United States has been strengthened by the extraordinary contributions of immigrants from Mexico and by Americans of Mexican heritage.

Mexican Americans enrich our communities, including my hometown of Chicago, where you can walk through neighborhoods like Pilsen, Little Village -- La Villita -- dotted with murals of Mexican patriots.  You can stop at a fonda, you can hear some mariachis, where we are inspired by the deep faith of our peoples at churches like Our Lady of Guadalupe.  Weâve got a Chicagoan in here somewhere.

And weâre so grateful to Mexican Americans in every segment of our society -- for teaching our children, and running our companies, and serving with honor in our military, and making breakthroughs in science, standing up for social justice.  As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. told Cesar Chavez once, we are âbrothers in the fight for equality.â1  And, in fact, without the strong support of Latinos, including so many Mexican Americans, I would not be standing today as President of the United States.  That's the truth.
 
And so given that is Americas heritage, given that we share a border with Mexico, given ties that run back generations, it is critical that the United States recognize the need to reform our immigration system -- because we are a nation of laws, but we're also a nation of immigrants.  Like every nation we have a responsibility to ensure that our laws are upheld.  But we also know that, as a nation of immigrants, the immigration system we have in the United States right now doesnât reflect our values.  It separates families when we should be reuniting them. Itâs led to millions of people to live in the shadows.  It deprives us of the talents of so many young people -- even though we know that immigrants have always been the engine of our economy, starting some of our greatest companies and pioneering new industries.
 
Thatâs one of the reasons I acted to lift the shadow of deportation from what we call the DREAMers -- young people brought to the United States as children.  And thatâs why Iâm working with our Congress to pass common-sense immigration reform this year.  I'm convinced we can get it done.  Reform that continues to strengthen border security and strengthen legal immigration, so citizens donât have to wait years to bring their families to the United States.  Reform that holds everyone accountable -- so immigrants get on the right side of the law and so immigrants are not exploited and abused.  And most of all, reform that gives millions of undocumented individuals a pathway to earn their citizenship.  And Iâm optimistic that -- after years of trying -- we are going to get it done this year.  I'm absolutely convinced of it.

Obviously, weâre going to have to work with the Mexican government to make sure that we've got a well-regulated border.  But I also want to work with the Mexican government because I believe that the long-term solution to the challenge of illegal immigration is a growing and prosperous Mexico that creates more jobs and opportunities for young people here.
 
I agree with the Mexican student who said, âI feel like we can reach the same level as anyone in the world.â  That's absolutely true.  And so I firmly believe -- juntos, podemos lograr mÃ¡s -- ""together, we can achieve more.""  So with the remainder of my time today, I want to focus on five areas where we can do more.
 
Number one, letâs do more to expand trade and commerce that creates good jobs for our people.  We already buy more of your exports than any country in the world.  We sell more of our exports to Mexico than we do to Brazil, Russia, India and China combined.  Mexican companies are investing more in the United States, and weâre the largest foreign investor in Mexico -- because we believe in Mexico and want to be a partner in your success.
 
So guided by the new economic dialogue that President PeÃ±a Nieto and I announced yesterday, letâs do more to unlock the true potential of our relationship.  Letâs keep investing in our roads and our bridges and our border crossings so we can trade faster and cheaper.  Letâs help our smaller businesses, which employ most of our workers, access new markets and new capital -- the big markets right across the border.  Letâs empower our young entrepreneurs as they create startup companies that can transform how we live.  And letâs realize the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year, so our two nations can compete and win in the fast-growing markets of the Asia Pacific.  If the United States and Mexico are working together, we can sell a whole lot of things on the other side of the Pacific Ocean where the fastest-growing economies are taking off right now.  That's number one.
 
Number two, letâs not just sell more things to each other, letâs build more things together.  With many of our companies operating in both countries, parts are now being shipped back and forth across the border as theyâre assembled.  So every day, U.S. and Mexican workers are building things together -- whether itâs crafts -- or whether itâs cars, or aircraft, or computers, or satellites.
 
I think this is only the beginning.  Given the skills of our workers, it makes even more sense for companies around the world to set up shop in the United States and set up shop in Mexico.  And as Mexico reforms, weâre going to be able to do more business together and sell more goods around the world.  And the more that our companies collaborate, the more competitive theyâll be.  And the entire hemisphere will benefit because of those links and chains that have been created between our two countries.

Number three, as we secure our economic future, letâs secure our energy future, including the clean energy that we need to combat climate change.  Our nations are blessed with boundless natural beauty -- from our coastlines and farmlands to your tropical forests.  But climate change is happening.  The science is undeniable.  And so is the fact that our economies must become greener.
 
In the United States, weâve made historic commitments to clean and renewable energy like solar and wind power.  We've made a commitment to reduce the emissions of harmful carbon pollution.  And here in Mexico, youâre a leader in cutting carbon emissions and helping developing countries do the same.  So, together, letâs keep building new energy partnerships by harnessing all these new sources, and, by the way, creating the good jobs that come with these new technologies.  And letâs keep investing in green buildings and technologies that make our entire economy more efficient, but also make our planet cleaner and safer for future generations.

Number four -- and this is part of staying competitive -- letâs do more together in education so our young people have the knowledge and skills to succeed.  Here in Mexico youâve made important progress, with more children staying in school longer, and record numbers of students like you getting a university education.  Just imagine how much the students of our two countries could do together, how much we could learn from each other.

And thatâs why President PeÃ±a Nieto and I announced a new partnership in higher education -- to encourage more collaboration between our universities and our university students.  Weâre going to focus on science and  technology, on engineering and mathematics.  And this is part of my broader initiative called 100,000 Strong in the Americas.  We want 100,000 students from the United States studying in Latin America, including Mexico.  And we want 100,000 Latin American students, including Mexican students, to come to study in the United States of America.  Because when we study together, and we learn together, we work together, and we prosper together -- that's what I believe.

And finally, to help spark prosperity in both out countries, letâs truly invest in innovation, and research and development together.  Here in Mexico, youâre now a global leader in graduating engineers and technicians.  One of Mexicoâs leading scientists, Rafael Navarro-GonzÃ¡lez, is helping analyze data from the rover that we landed on Mars.
 
So, together, letâs remember that every dollar, every peso that we invest in research and development returns so much more to our economies in jobs and opportunity, new products, new services.  That's why I'm calling for us to forge new partnerships in aerospace, and IT, and nanotechnology and biotechnology and robotics.  Letâs answer the hope of a young woman -- a student at the National Polytechnic Institute -- who spoke for many in your generation, so eager to make your mark.  She said, âGive us jobs as creators.â  Give us jobs as creators.

Sometimes young people are known as just consumers of goods, but we want young people creating the new products, the next big thing that will change how we live our lives.  That's the agenda that I want to pursue.

And I understand that there are those both here in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, but also back home in the United States, who are skeptical of your progress, who maybe doubt the  capacity for us to make the most of this moment.  There are always cynics who say, aw, this is too hard, the headwinds you face are too stiff.  They say Mexico has been here before we look like we're making progress, we're looking at a bright horizon, on the verge of great possibility, but then we get blown off course.

And itâs true that nothing is inevitable.  Progress and success is never guaranteed.  The future that you dream of, the Mexico you imagine -- it must be built, it must be earned.  Nobody else can do it for you.  Only you can earn it.  You are the future.  As Nervo wrote in âLa Raza de Bronce,â tu eres el sueÃ±o -- you are the dream.

For just as it was patriots who answered the call when Father Hidalgo rang the church bell two centuries ago, you -- your lives, in a free Mexico -- are the dream that they imagined.  And now it falls to you to keep alive those virtues for which so many generations of Mexicans struggled.
 
You are the dream that can stand up for justice and human rights and human dignity, here at home and around the world.  Youâre the creators and the builders and the climbers and the strivers who can deliver progress and prosperity that will lift up not just the Mexican people for generations to come, but the entire world.
 
Youâre the men and women who will push this nation upwards as Mexico assumes its rightful place, as you proudly sing: âin heaven your eternal destiny was written by the finger of God.â
 
You are the dream.  This is your moment.  And as you reach for the future, always remember that you have the greatest of  partners, the greatest if friends -- the nation that is rooting for your success more than anybody else -- your neighbor, the United States of America.

Viva MÃ©xico!  Viva los Estados Unidos!  Que Dios los bendiga!  Thank you very much.
","President Barack Obama directly addressed the Mexican people on Friday in a televised speech, but on the issue of immigration, he appealed to distinct audiences in two different countries.

The president walked a careful line as he sketched his ideas for an immigration overhaul. He told his Mexican audience that legislation would provide a pathway to citizenship, but underscored that many in the U.S. want to see immigration laws aggressively enforced.

""We are a nation of laws, but we're also a nation of immigrants. Like every nation we have a responsibility to ensure that our laws are upheld,"" Mr. Obama said. ""But we also know that, as a nation of immigrants, the immigration system we have in the United States right now doesn't reflect our values.""

Mr. Obama's three-day trip to Mexico and Costa Rica, lasting through Saturday, could have implications for his domestic agenda. While administration officials have tried to elevate economic issues this week, immigration has remained prominently in the foreground.

On Friday, the president worked to build good will across the border, crediting Americans from Mexico and those of Mexican descent with helping to elect him and reminding listeners of his efforts to allow immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children to stay in the country.

Mr. Obama drew cheers as he predicted that new immigration laws would be enacted.

Back home, though, Mr. Obama will return to a divided Congress where an immigration bill still faces uncertain prospects and has limited support among Republicans. A bipartisan group of eight senators collaborated on legislation, but not all of the architects of the plan are confident it can win approval.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), a key conservative voice, wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Friday that the proposal he helped craft still can be improved, opening the door to even more-stringent border-security measures and a tougher road for those who immigrated illegally, among other possible changes.

In Costa Rica on Friday night, Mr. Obama reiterated his support for an amendment granting equal immigration benefits to same-sex couples. But he also said at a news conference that he wasn't likely to get everything he wants in the legislation. He added that additional changes could be made later date.

Before Mr. Obama's trip to Mexico, administration officials noted the caution necessary in discussing new immigration laws while in Mexico, and said they expected Mexican officials to leave the issue to U.S. leaders to resolve.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto appeared to hew to that guidance at a news conference on Thursday, offering few words on immigration.

Still, Mr. Obama came to Mexico seeking cooperation on securing the border, while saying that the long-term solution to illegal immigration is a growing and prosperous Mexico where more people can work.

In Mexico, pressure to emigrate to the U.S. has eased, in part due to a tough labor market in the U.S. and steady growth in Mexico. More than 11 million Mexicans already live in the U.S.

""The pull factors stimulating emigration to the U.S. have changed,"" said Tony Payan, a visiting scholar at Rice University in Houston, who also credits improved border security for reducing emigration.

Immigration from Mexico, the home country of a majority of newcomers to the U.S., declined 3% in January from the previous year, the Inter-American Development Bank reported in a recent study.

Mexico's statistics agency also has documented the steady decline. Immigration from Mexico during the fourth quarter of last year was 29.4 people per 10,000 inhabitants, compared with 78.5 in the fourth quarter of 2006.

The recent dip in Mexican emigration to the U.S. may be only temporary.","President Obama, speaking to an enthusiastic crowd of young people here, on Friday declared a new era in relations with Mexico that will focus on strengthening the countries' economic ties and that will play down the battle against drug gangs that has dominated the discourse for several years.

Hours after a private dinner with President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto of Mexico, who has made an overhaul of laws to foster economic growth the highlight of his five-month-old term, Mr. Obama urged Americans to look past stereotypes of Mexican violence and despair, and embrace the country's strengthening democracy and economic health.

""We agree that the relationship between our nations must be defined not by the threats that we face, but by the prosperity and the opportunity that we can create together,"" Mr. Obama said to vigorous applause before an audience of high school and college students at the National Anthropology Museum.

After suggesting a few days ago that security relations between the United States and Mexico could be better, Mr. Obama hardly mentioned the subject in his speech or in earlier remarks on Thursday, a sign the topic has given American officials plenty of headaches. Thousands of people have been killed in battles between Mexican drug gangs and the police and military, while the flow of cocaine and marijuana flourishes.

Business analysts have said Mexico's economy would be even further along without its violence. But investment has gone forward, and the economy is a sunnier subject over all; the United States is Mexico's largest trading partner and Mexico is the United States' third largest, behind Canada and China.

Poverty remains deep here. Mr. PeÃ±a Nieto acknowledged this week that three of five Mexicans scrape by on informal jobs and that wages have so stagnated that they are now lower than China's, contributing to a sense among the members of the public that they are not yet feeling ""Mexico's moment,"" as the government slogan would have it.

But a surge of investment in manufacturing, technology and other sectors has helped lift the middle class and consumer spending and contributed to growth levels in the national economy that have been double those of the United States in the past two years.

Still, economic and trade talks have caused plenty of friction and disagreements, too.

Mexican government officials, in private talks with Mr. Obama, homed in on long, costly waits for trucks and workers at the international border in both directions, but far more severe going into the United States.

The backups grew significantly with the United States security clampdown on the border after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and budget constraints and the political reality of the mood for tighter border security may inhibit building new or larger stations or adding manpower to them.

But senior administration and Mexican officials suggested public-private partnerships could finance renovations.

""There was certainly recognition on both sides that this is something that we need to focus on,"" said one senior United States official who participated in the meetings. ""It brings together the issue of border safety, border security, immigration and trade.""

Antonio Garza, a former American ambassador and now counsel in the Mexico City office of White & Case, said Mexican and American officials have long suggested building customs stations in Mexican territory away from the regular border crossings and other short-term fixes that would speed commerce.

""The discussion now is how can you take the level of commitment to security and apply it to making the border commerce more efficient?"" he said.

American officials said they expect such topics to be a priority of a new economic dialogue that is to begin this fall and include cabinet members, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and senior Mexican economic officials.

Analysts suggested high-profile talks about ways to improve trade and economic ties were a significant step and a recognition that the principal trade deal, the North American Free Trade Agreement, is in some ways outmoded at 20 years old.

Later Friday, Mr. Obama arrived in Costa Rica, where he was expected to take his message of promoting economic improvement and to attend a meeting of regional leaders on Saturday.",2013-05-04,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.993, NEU: 0.005, NEG: 0.002})",0.9930332899093628,0.005026703234761953,0.001940038870088756,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.591, NEU: 0.406, NEG: 0.003})","AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.822, NEU: 0.175, NEG: 0.002})",0.5908781290054321,0.4060286283493042,0.003093283623456955,0.8224689960479736,0.17507155239582062,0.002459416864439845
58,58,2013-06-19-BerlinSpeech.txt,"Thank you, Chancellor Merkel, for your leadership, your friendship, and the example of your life -- from a child of the East to the leader of a free and united Germany.
 
As Iâve said, Angela and I donât exactly look like previous German and American leaders.  But the fact that we can stand here today, along the fault line where a city was divided, speaks to an eternal truth:  No wall can stand against the yearning of justice, the yearnings for freedom, the yearnings for peace that burns in the human heart.

Mayor Wowereit, distinguished guests, and especially the people of Berlin and of Germany -- thank you for this extraordinarily warm welcome.  In fact, it's so warm and I feel so good that I'm actually going to take off my jacket, and anybody else who wants to, feel free to.   We can be a little more informal among friends.

As your Chancellor mentioned, five years ago I had the privilege to address this city as senator.  Today, I'm proud to return as President of the United States.  And I bring with me the enduring friendship of the American people, as well as my wife, Michelle, and Malia and Sasha.  You may notice that they're not here.  The last thing they want to do is to listen to another speech from me.  So they're out experiencing the beauty and the history of Berlin.  And this history speaks to us today.
 
Here, for thousands of years, the people of this land have journeyed from tribe to principality to nation-state; through Reformation and Enlightenment, renowned as a âland of poets and thinkers,â among them Immanuel Kant, who taught us that freedom is the âunoriginated birthright of man, and it belongs to him by force of his humanity.â
 
Here, for two centuries, this gate stood tall as the world around it convulsed -- through the rise and fall of empires; through revolutions and republics; art and music and science that reflected the height of human endeavor, but also war and carnage that exposed the depths of manâs cruelty to man.
 
It was here that Berliners carved out an island of democracy against the greatest of odds.  As has already been mentioned, they were supported by an airlift of hope, and we are so honored to be joined by Colonel Halvorsen, 92 years old -- the original âcandy bomber.â  We could not be prouder of him.  I hope I look that good, by the way, when I'm 92.

During that time, a Marshall Plan seeded a miracle, and a North Atlantic Alliance protected our people.  And those in the neighborhoods and nations to the East drew strength from the knowledge that freedom was possible here, in Berlin -- that the waves of crackdowns and suppressions might therefore someday be overcome.
 
Today, 60 years after they rose up against oppression, we remember the East German heroes of June 17th.  When the wall finally came down, it was their dreams that were fulfilled.  Their strength and their passion, their enduring example remind us that for all the power of militaries, for all the authority of governments, it is citizens who choose whether to be defined by a wall, or whether to tear it down.

And weâre now surrounded by the symbols of a Germany reborn.  A rebuilt Reichstag and its glistening glass dome.  An American embassy back at its historic home on Pariser Platz.  And this square itself, once a desolate no manâs land, is now open to all.  So while I am not the first American President to come to this gate, I am proud to stand on its Eastern side to pay tribute to the past.

For throughout all this history, the fate of this city came down to a simple question:  Will we live free or in chains?  Under governments that uphold our universal rights, or regimes that suppress them?  In open societies that respect the sanctity of the individual and our free will, or in closed societies that suffocate the soul?
 
As free peoples, we stated our convictions long ago. As Americans, we believe that âall men are created equalâ with the right to life and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  And as Germans, you declared in your Basic Law that âthe dignity of man is inviolable.â  Around the world, nations have pledged themselves to a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the inherent dignity and rights of all members of our human family.
 
And this is what was at stake here in Berlin all those years.  And because courageous crowds climbed atop that wall, because corrupt dictatorships gave way to new democracies, because millions across this continent now breathe the fresh air of freedom, we can say, here in Berlin, here in Europe -- our values won.  Openness won.  Tolerance won.  And freedom won here in Berlin.

And yet, more than two decades after that triumph, we must acknowledge that there can, at times, be a complacency among our Western democracies.  Today, people often come together in places like this to remember history -- not to make it.  After all, we face no concrete walls, no barbed wire.  There are no tanks poised across a border.  There are no visits to fallout shelters.  And so sometimes there can be a sense that the great challenges have somehow passed.  And that brings with it a temptation to turn inward -- to think of our own pursuits, and not the sweep of history; to believe that weâve settled historyâs accounts, that we can simply enjoy the fruits won by our forebears.
 
But I come here today, Berlin, to say complacency is not the character of great nations.  Todayâs threats are not as stark as they were half a century ago, but the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity -- that struggle goes on.  And Iâve come here, to this city of hope, because the tests of our time demand the same fighting spirit that defined Berlin a half-century ago.
 
Chancellor Merkel mentioned that we mark the anniversary of President John F. Kennedyâs stirring defense of freedom, embodied in the people of this great city.  His pledge of solidarity -- âIch bin ein Berlinerâ -- echoes through the ages.  But thatâs not all that he said that day.  Less remembered is the challenge that he issued to the crowd before him:  âLet me ask you,â he said to those Berliners, âlet me ask you to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of todayâ and âbeyond the freedom of merely this city.â  Look, he said, âto the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.â
 
President Kennedy was taken from us less than six months after he spoke those words.  And like so many who died in those decades of division, he did not live to see Berlin united and free.  Instead, he lives forever as a young man in our memory.  But his words are timeless because they call upon us to care more about things than just our own self-comfort, about our own city, about our own country.  They demand that we embrace the common endeavor of all humanity.
 
And if we lift our eyes, as President Kennedy called us to do, then weâll recognize that our work is not yet done.  For we are not only citizens of America or Germany -- we are also citizens of the world.  And our fates and fortunes are linked like never before.
 
We may no longer live in fear of global annihilation, but so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe.  We may strike blows against terrorist networks, but if we ignore the instability and intolerance that fuels extremism, our own freedom will eventually be endangered.  We may enjoy a standard of living that is the envy of the world, but so long as hundreds of millions endure the agony of an empty stomach or the anguish of unemployment, weâre not truly prosperous.

I say all this here, in the heart of Europe, because our shared past shows that none of these challenges can be met unless we see ourselves as part of something bigger than our own experience.  Our alliance is the foundation of global security.  Our trade and our commerce is the engine of our global economy.  Our values call upon us to care about the lives of people we will never meet.  When Europe and America lead with our hopes instead of our fears, we do things that no other nations can do, no other nations will do.  So we have to lift up our eyes today and consider the day of peace with justice that our generation wants for this world. 
 
I'd suggest that peace with justice begins with the example we set here at home, for we know from our own histories that intolerance breeds injustice.  Whether it's based on race, or religion, gender or sexual orientation, we are stronger when all our people -- no matter who they are or what they look like -- are granted opportunity, and when our wives and our daughters have the same opportunities as our husbands and our sons.

When we respect the faiths practiced in our churches and synagogues, our mosques and our temples, we're more secure.  When we welcome the immigrant with his talents or her dreams, we are renewed.  When we stand up for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters and treat their love and their rights equally under the law, we defend our own liberty as well.  We are more free when all people can pursue their own happiness.  And as long as walls exist in our hearts to separate us from those who donât look like us, or think like us, or worship as we do, then we're going to have to work harder, together, to bring those walls of division down. 
 
Peace with justice means free enterprise that unleashes the talents and creativity that reside in each of us; in other models, direct economic growth from the top down or relies solely on the resources extracted from the earth.  But we believe that real prosperity comes from our most precious resource -- our people.  And thatâs why we choose to invest in education, and science and research.

And now, as we emerge from recession, we must not avert our eyes from the insult of widening inequality, or the pain of youth who are unemployed.  We have to build new ladders of opportunity in our own societies that -- even as we pursue new trade and investment that fuels growth across the Atlantic. 
 
America will stand with Europe as you strengthen your union.  And we want to work with you to make sure that every person can enjoy the dignity that comes from work -- whether they live in Chicago or Cleveland or Belfast or Berlin, in Athens or Madrid, everybody deserves opportunity.  We have to have economies that are working for all people, not just those at the very top.

Peace with justice means extending a hand to those who reach for freedom, wherever they live.  Different peoples and cultures will follow their own path, but we must reject the lie that those who live in distant places donât yearn for freedom and self-determination just like we do; that they donât somehow yearn for dignity and rule of law just like we do.  We cannot dictate the pace of change in places like the Arab world, but we must reject the excuse that we can do nothing to support it.

We cannot shrink from our role of advancing the values we believe in -- whether it's supporting Afghans as they take responsibility for their future, or working for an Israeli-Palestinian peace -- or engaging as we've done in Burma to help create space for brave people to emerge from decades of dictatorship.  In this century, these are the citizens who long to join the free world.  They are who you were.  They deserve our support, for they too, in their own way, are citizens of Berlin.  And we have to help them every day.

Peace with justice means pursuing the security of a world without nuclear weapons -- no matter how distant that dream may be.  And so, as President, I've strengthened our efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and reduced the number and role of Americaâs nuclear weapons.  Because of the New START Treaty, weâre on track to cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s.

But we have more work to do.  So today, Iâm announcing additional steps forward.  After a comprehensive review, Iâve determined that we can ensure the security of America and our allies, and maintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent, while reducing our deployed strategic nuclear weapons by up to one-third.  And I intend to seek negotiated cuts with Russia to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures.

At the same time, weâll work with our NATO allies to seek bold reductions in U.S. and Russian tactical weapons in Europe.  And we can forge a new international framework for peaceful nuclear power, and reject the nuclear weaponization that North Korea and Iran may be seeking. 
 
America will host a summit in 2016 to continue our efforts to secure nuclear materials around the world, and we will work to build support in the United States to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and call on all nations to begin negotiations on a treaty that ends the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons.  These are steps we can take to create a world of peace with justice.

Peace with justice means refusing to condemn our children to a harsher, less hospitable planet.  The effort to slow climate change requires bold action.  And on this, Germany and Europe have led.

In the United States, we have recently doubled our renewable energy from clean sources like wind and solar power.  Weâre doubling fuel efficiency on our cars.  Our dangerous carbon emissions have come down.  But we know we have to do more -- and we will do more.

With a global middle class consuming more energy every day, this must now be an effort of all nations, not just some.  For the grim alternative affects all nations -- more severe storms, more famine and floods, new waves of refugees, coastlines that vanish, oceans that rise.  This is the future we must avert.  This is the global threat of our time.  And for the sake of future generations, our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate before it is too late.  That is our job.  That is our task.  We have to get to work.

Peace with justice means meeting our moral obligations.  And we have a moral obligation and a profound interest in helping lift the impoverished corners of the world.  By promoting growth so we spare a child born today a lifetime of extreme poverty.  By investing in agriculture, so we arenât just sending food, but also teaching farmers to grow food.  By strengthening public health, so weâre not just sending medicine, but training doctors and nurses who will help end the outrage of children dying from preventable diseases.  Making sure that we do everything we can to realize the promise -- an achievable promise -- of the first AIDS-free generation.  That is something that is possible if we feel a sufficient sense of urgency.

Our efforts have to be about more than just charity.  Theyâre about new models of empowering people -- to build institutions; to abandon the rot of corruption; to create ties of trade, not just aid, both with the West and among the nations theyâre seeking to rise and increase their capacity.  Because when they succeed, we will be more successful as well.  Our fates are linked, and we cannot ignore those who are yearning not only for freedom but also prosperity.
 
And finally, letâs remember that peace with justice depends on our ability to sustain both the security of our societies and the openness that defines them.  Threats to freedom donât merely come from the outside.  They can emerge from within -- from our own fears, from the disengagement of our citizens. 
 
For over a decade, America has been at war.  Yet much has now changed over the five years since I last spoke here in Berlin.  The Iraq war is now over.  The Afghan war is coming to an end.  Osama bin Laden is no more.  Our efforts against al Qaeda are evolving.
 
And given these changes, last month, I spoke about Americaâs efforts against terrorism.  And I drew inspiration from one of our founding fathers, James Madison, who wrote, âNo nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.â  James Madison is right -- which is why, even as we remain vigilant about the threat of terrorism, we must move beyond a mindset of perpetual war.  And in America, that means redoubling our efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo.  It means tightly controlling our use of new technologies like drones.  It means balancing the pursuit of security with the protection of privacy.

And I'm confident that that balance can be struck.  I'm confident of that, and I'm confident that working with Germany, we can keep each other safe while at the same time maintaining those essential values for which we fought for. 
 
Our current programs are bound by the rule of law, and they're focused on threats to our security -- not the communications of ordinary persons.  They help confront real dangers, and they keep people safe here in the United States and here in Europe.  But we must accept the challenge that all of us in democratic governments face:  to listen to the voices who disagree with us; to have an open debate about how we use our powers and how we must constrain them; and to always remember that government exists to serve the power of the individual, and not the other way around.  Thatâs what makes us who we are, and thatâs what makes us different from those on the other side of the wall.

That is how we'll stay true to our better history while reaching for the day of peace and justice that is to come.  These are the beliefs that guide us, the values that inspire us, the principles that bind us together as free peoples who still believe the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- that ""injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.""

And we should ask, should anyone ask if our generation has the courage to meet these tests?  If anybody asks if President Kennedy's words ring true today, let them come to Berlin, for here they will find the people who emerged from the ruins of war to reap the blessings of peace; from the pain of division to the joy of reunification.  And here, they will recall how people trapped behind a wall braved bullets, and jumped barbed wire, and dashed across minefields, and dug through tunnels, and leapt from buildings, and swam across the Spree to claim their most basic right of freedom.

The wall belongs to history.  But we have history to make as well.  And the heroes that came before us now call to us to live up to those highest ideals -- to care for the young people who can't find a job in our own countries, and the girls who aren't allowed to go to school overseas; to be vigilant in safeguarding our own freedoms, but also to extend a hand to those who are reaching for freedom abroad.
 
This is the lesson of the ages.  This is the spirit of Berlin.  And the greatest tribute that we can pay to those who came before us is by carrying on their work to pursue peace and justice not only in our countries but for all mankind. 
 
Vielen Dank.  God bless you.  God bless the peoples of Germany.  And God bless the United States of America.

Thank you very much.
","President Barack Obama will make the case for a new phase in nuclear-weapons reductions that would reduce arsenals by another one-third in a major foreign-policy speech in Berlin on Wednesday, a senior Obama administration official said.

Despite mounting tensions with Russia over the Syrian civil war and missile defense, Mr. Obama is expected in the speech to say the U.S. and Russia can significantly reduce their arsenals beyond the cuts mandated under the 2010 New Start, or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, without undercutting deterrence or capabilities, the officials said.

A one-third cut would allow Washington and Moscow to lower the number of warheads to between 1,000 and 1,100 each, down from the New Start limit of 1,550. That would leave them with more than enough warheads to deter any current or future adversary, said U.S. officials.

""The president determined that we can ensure the security of the United States, and our allies and partners, and maintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent, while safely pursuing up to a one-third reduction in deployed strategic nuclear weapons from the level established in the New Start treaty,"" a senior Obama administration official said of Mr. Obama's message in the speech.

Mr. Obama told Russian President Vladimir Putin about wanting talks on the reduction plans on the sidelines of a meeting in Northern Ireland of major powers, the official said. ""Our hope and expectation would be that, in the coming weeks or months, we'll get folks together to start that conversation. But in terms of a timeline, we're not there,"" the official said.

Wednesday's speech will be Mr. Obama's most specific arms reduction proposal since the New Start treaty was ratified after a prolonged battle in 2010.

Nuclear-arms experts said Mr. Obama doesn't need to wait for a formal treaty to move on new cuts. The two presidents instead could achieve similar results, more rapidly, through parallel, reciprocal cuts of strategic warheads to well below 1,000 within the next five years. Such cuts could be verified under the 2010 New Start treaty, experts said.

The administration would, ""as a general proposition,"" seek to negotiate such reductions as part of a new treaty with Moscow, which would require Senate ratification, the senior administration official said.

But the White House hasn't ruled out an alternative approach of seeking parallel, reciprocal reductions that could be undertaken by both governments without a treaty, eliminating the need for Senate ratification.

""Our intent is to seek negotiated cuts with Russia so we can continue to move beyond the Cold War nuclear posture,"" the official said. ""But it's too early to tell since we haven't even started discussions with the Russians on what it will look like.""

Mr. Obama, several U.S. officials said, wants to push ahead with the reductions despite tensions with Moscow, arguing that the arms-control effort shouldn't be derailed by disagreements.

Mr. Obama's speech in Berlin will be given at the Brandenburg Gate, the site of important addresses by past presidents.

The address will touch on a broad array of topics, but officials said arms control will be an important part. On Tuesday, Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, told reporters that Mr. Obama will call for the same kinds of activism evoked by President Kennedy 50 years ago to be applied to current challenges, including ""nuclear-arms control and nonproliferation.""

Mr. Obama has made reducing the size of global nuclear arsenals a priority, but the effort stalled after the 2010 treaty.

Some European officials voiced concerns that Russia won't reciprocate with equal warhead reductions and will balk at cutting its tactical-nuclear-weapons arsenal. Russia maintains some 2,000 tactical nuclear bombs, according to an analysis by the Arms Control Association, which advocates for reductions in the nuclear arsenal. The U.S., in turn, keeps 180 aircraft-delivered nuclear bombs in Europe.

The senior administration official said the disputes between the U.S. and Russia shouldn't affect talks over nuclear reductions because both the U.S. and Russia are acting based on what they see as their interests.

Officials said the administration's plans will keep the nuclear triad -- submarines, intercontinental missiles and bombers -- in place. While the final proposed cut was decided by the White House, the plans have been the subject of intense discussions among the Pentagon and Department of Energy for months.

""If you still have 1,100 weapons that is pretty good deterrence,"" said one U.S. official.","President Obama plans to use a speech in Berlin on Wednesday to outline plans for further reductions in the American nuclear arsenal if Russia agrees to pare back its weapons at the same time, administration officials said Tuesday.

Resuming a drive toward disarmament that he had largely shunted aside over the past two years, Mr. Obama will propose trimming the number of strategic warheads that each of the two big nuclear powers still maintains by up to a third, taking them below the 1,550 permitted in the treaty he signed with Russia in his first term, a senior administration official said. That would leave each country with just over 1,000 weapons.

Mr. Obama will also declare that he will work with NATO allies to develop proposals for major cuts in tactical nuclear weapons, which are not covered by the existing treaty. Russia, which has far more tactical nuclear weapons deployed than the United States and Europe do, has firmly resisted such cuts. There are fears that its tactical weapons are in parts of Russia where they risk being seized by terrorist groups.

Mr. Obama will also announce that he will host a final nuclear security summit meeting in the United States just before he leaves office.

The president, who once talked about eventually ridding the world of nuclear weapons, faces enormous obstacles to any further reductions, both in Moscow and in Washington. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has demanded further concessions on missile defense before entertaining deeper nuclear cuts, and Republicans in the Senate have made clear they would resist any treaty that went beyond the New Start pact ratified in 2010. Mr. Obama's aides have said that they have no appetite for another treaty battle, and that they would try to follow the precedent of the first President George Bush, who arranged reciprocal but not binding cuts with the dying Soviet Union without a treaty.

But the president's return to the issue of nuclear reductions, however tentative, suggests he wants to invest at least some of his remaining time in office to making enough progress that he can point to it as an important legacy. ""It's a way of signaling what he sees his agenda for the rest of his second term being,"" said an administration official, who, like others, declined to be identified in advance of the speech.

Supporters of further disarmament said they hoped Mr. Obama would refocus attention on the goal after rarely mentioning it in recent years, while he was consumed by other issues. ""The most important thing he could do is lay out the broad agenda for the next three and a half years,"" said John Isaacs, executive director of the Council for a Livable World, an advocacy group.

In addition to further reductions, Mr. Isaacs said, there are several policy changes Mr. Obama could take that would move the country further away from cold war-style national security. He said the president could take nuclear weapons off high alert and change nuclear doctrine to say that the only purpose of such weapons would be as a deterrent.

But administration officials cautioned against expecting the Berlin speech to be a sequel to Mr. Obama's 2009 address in Prague laying out his vision for a nuclear-free world. Instead, nuclear reductions will be just one element of a larger, thematic address, officials said, and the president will not get into much detail about specific policy changes.

That is a significant lowering of the bar: For a while, Mr. Obama considered setting out much more ambitious goals in a speech administration officials hoped he would give this month, on the 50th anniversary of a famous speech John F. Kennedy gave at American University. That speech, less than a year after the Cuban missile crisis, created the push for what became the nuclear test ban treaty, signed two months later.

Early in Mr. Obama's first term, aides described an ambitious agenda that included ratifying the long-stalled Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and negotiating a new treaty that would ban the production of new fissile material, the makings of nuclear fuel. In the Berlin speech, Mr. Obama will repeat his call for the test ban treaty but will set no deadline for submitting it to the Senate, because of administration fears that it would go down to a second defeat.

Pakistan has blocked the opening of negotiations on the fissile material ban, and administration officials say they will put pressure on the new Pakistani government to move on that issue. He will also have to press Pakistan to cease its deployment of a new generation of tactical weapons that officials fear could easily be stolen by terrorists.

Mr. Obama's early agenda has been frustrated by many setbacks. North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests during his tenure. Iran has installed 17,000 centrifuges and now has enough low- and medium-enriched fuel to produce a half dozen weapons, with further enrichment. Pakistan has the world's fastest growing arsenal. Once Republicans made gains in the Senate, Mr. Obama never submitted the test ban treaty for ratification or negotiated further cuts with Russia.

Perhaps Mr. Obama's biggest success has been his effort to lock down vulnerable nuclear materials around the world, a task nearly all countries have agreed to, even if he did not accomplish the entire job in the four years he initially envisioned.

The New Start treaty limited both the United States and Russia to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads and 800 missiles, bombers and submarine launchers, of which 700 could be deployed. As of March 1, Russia -- with 1,480 deployed warheads and 492 deployed launchers -- had already met two of the three limits and was close to the third. The United States -- with 1,654 deployed warheads and 792 deployed launchers -- was close but not under the caps.

Mr. Obama appears to recognize that the follow-up treaty he once envisioned with Russia now may be too difficult to push through the Senate. Instead, if Russia agreed to further cuts, the existing verification systems in the old treaty would be used to confirm that both sides were abiding by their new commitments.

Well, I wanted to come out here, first of all, to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session. The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks, there's going to obviously be a whole range of issuesâimmigration, economics, et ceteraâwe'll try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions.

The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions, but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week: the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling. I gaveâin a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday. But watching the debate over the course of the last week, I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit.

First of all, I want to make sure that, once again, I send my thoughts and prayers as well as Michelle's to the family of Trayvon Martin and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they've dealt with the entire situation. I can only imagine what they're going through, and it's remarkable how they've handled it.

The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday, which is, there are going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case; I'll let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues. The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner. The prosecution and the defense made their arguments. The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this, reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict. And once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works. But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling.

When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.

There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me, at least before I was a Senator. There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often.

And I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida. And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear. The African American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws, everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws. And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case.

Now, this isn't to say that the African American community is naive about the fact that African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, that they're disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence. It's not to make excuses for that fact, although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context. They understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history.

And so the fact that sometimes that's unacknowledged adds to the frustration. And the fact that a lot of African American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given, ""Well, there are these statistics out there that show that African American boys are more violent."" Using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain.

I think the African American community is also not naive in understanding that, statistically, somebody like Trayvon Martin was statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else. So folks understand the challenges that exist for African American boys. But they get frustrated, I think, if they feel that there's no context for it and that context is being denied. And that all contributes, I think, to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.

Now, the question for me at least, and I think for a lot of folks, is where do we take this? How do we learn some lessons from this and move in a positive direction? I think it's understandable that there have been demonstrations and vigils and protests, and some of that stuff is just going to have to work its way through, as long as it remains nonviolent. If I see any violence, then I will remind folks that that dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family. But beyond protests or vigils, the question is, are there some concrete things that we might be able to do?

I know that Eric Holder is reviewing what happened down there, but I think it's important for people to have some clear expectations here. Traditionally, these are issues of State and local government, the criminal code. And law enforcement is traditionally done at the State and local levels, not at the Federal levels.

That doesn't mean, though, that as a nation, we can't do some things that I think would be productive. So let me just give a couple of specifics that I'm still bouncing around with my staff; so we're not rolling out some five-point plan, but some areas where I think all of us could potentially focus.

Number one, precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the State and local level, I think it would be productive for the Justice Department, Governors, mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the State and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists.

When I was in Illinois, I passed racial profiling legislation, and it actually did just two simple things. One, it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped. But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the State on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing. And initially, the police departments across the State were resistant, but actually, they came to recognize that if it was done in a fair, straightforward way, that it would allow them to do their jobs better and communities would have more confidence in them and, in turn, be more helpful in applying the law. And obviously, law enforcement has got a very tough job.

So that's one area where I think there are a lot of resources and best practices that could be brought to bear if State and local governments are receptive. And I think a lot of them would be. And let's figure out, are there ways for us to push out that kind of training?

Along the same lines, I think it would be useful for us to examine some State and local laws to see if itâif they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than diffuse potential altercations.

I know that there's been commentary about the fact that the ""Stand Your Ground"" laws in Florida were not used as a defense in the case. On the other hand, if we're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see?

And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these ""Stand Your Ground"" laws, I'd just ask people to consider, if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened? And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws.

Number threeâand this is a long-term projectâwe need to spend some time in thinking about how do we bolster and reinforce our African American boys. And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about. There are a lot of kids out there who need help who are getting a lot of negative reinforcement. And is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them?

I'm not naive about the prospects of some grand new Federal program. I'm not sure that that's what we're talking about here. But I do recognize that as President, I've got some convening power, and there are a lot of good programs that are being done across the country on this front. And for us to be able to gather together business leaders and local elected officials and clergy and celebrities and athletes and figure out how are we doing a better job helping young African American men feel that they're a full part of this society and that they've got pathways and avenues to succeed, I think that would be a pretty good outcome from what was obviously a tragic situation. And we're going to spend some time working on that and thinking about that.

And then, finally, I think it's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching. There has been talk about, should we convene a conversation on race? I haven't seen that be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations. They end up being stilted and politicized, and folks are locked into the positions they already have. On the other hand, in families and churches and workplaces, there's a possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can? Am I judging people as much as I can, based on not the color of their skin, but the content of their character? That would, I think, be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy.

And let me just leave you with a final thought that, as difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people, I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting better. Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race. It doesn't mean we're in a postracial society. It doesn't mean that racism is eliminated. But when I talk to Malia and Sasha, and I listen to their friends, and I see them interact, they're better than we areâthey're better than we wereâon these issues. And that's true in every community that I've visited all across the country.

And so we have to be vigilant, and we have to work on these issues. And those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature, as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions. But we should also have confidence that kids these days, I think, have more sense than we did back then and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did and that along this long, difficult journey, we're becoming a more perfect Union, not a perfect Union, but a more perfect Union. All right?

Thank you, guys.

","The Justice Department said Sunday it would weigh whether to file federal criminal charges against George Zimmerman after his acquittal in a shooting that set off a searing national debate over racial justice and self-defense laws.

Its statement came as groups including the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union urged U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to open a federal civil-rights case against Mr. Zimmerman, the former neighborhood-watch captain who shot and killed Trayvon Martin.

""Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation"" of civil-rights laws, a department spokeswoman said in a statement. The department has had an open investigation into the death of Mr. Martin since last year.

Mr. Zimmerman, a 29-year-old Hispanic, faced second-degree murder and manslaughter charges for shooting Mr. Martin, a 17-year-old African-American, in a gated community here in February 2012. Prosecutors argued that Mr. Zimmerman profiled the teen as a criminal, pursued him and provoked the deadly confrontation. Defense lawyers said Mr. Zimmerman was attacked by Mr. Martin and fired at him in self-defense.

The initial six-week delay in arresting Mr. Zimmerman triggered nationwide protests and accusations of racial injustice.

The NAACP and other groups blasted Saturday's not-guilty verdict as a miscarriage of justice.

""Those of us who are fathers, particularly of African-American boys, find it shockingly frightening,"" said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau. The message, he said, is, ""Not only can we do this, we can get away with it.""

Yet legal experts question whether such a case will be filed, given the high burden of proof prosecutors would face. They would likely have to show Mr. Zimmerman was motivated by racial hatred when he shot Mr. Martin, said Paul Callan, an attorney at Callan, Koster, Brady & Brennan LLP in New York.

""I think you could make out the case that unconscious racism caused Mr. Zimmerman to profile"" Mr. Martin, said Kenneth Nunn, assistant director of the Criminal Justice Center at the University of Florida's Levin College of Law. ""But there doesn't seem to be enough there to justify a claim that racial animus was the predicate behind Trayvon Martin's death.""

Attorneys for Mr. Martin's family said they are considering filing a civil lawsuit against Mr. Zimmerman, though they haven't made a decision. ""We're still trying to make sense of the verdict in the criminal case,"" said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family. ""We'll be talking about our options going forward in the coming days.""

Such a case would face high hurdles, legal observers say. Mr. Zimmerman can seek immunity from civil lawsuits under Florida's so-called Stand Your Ground law -- something his attorney said he planned to do. ""In effect, there will be no civil suits,"" said Tamara Lave, a University of Miami law professor. ""If there is a civil suit filed, it will be dismissed, and future ones will be barred.""

In the verdict's aftermath, protests erupted in cities across the country, from San Francisco to Sanford. Nearly all were peaceful, though a demonstration in Oakland resulted in some vandalism, according to a spokesman for the city's police department.

President Barack Obama on Sunday said ""a jury has spoken"" and asked the public to respect the Martin family's ""call for calm reflection."" He added, ""I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher.""

The buildup to Mr. Zimmerman's murder trial featured extensive commentary about the roles that race and Florida's controversial 2005 Stand Your Ground law played in the case. In the end, however, neither figured much in the courtroom battle.

Mr. Zimmerman's attorneys prevailed without relying on the provisions of the ""Stand Your Ground"" gun-rights law, which eliminates the duty for a person to retreat in the face of danger before using lethal force. Under the measure, they had the option of seeking a court ruling, before any trial, that Mr. Zimmerman acted legally. But instead, his lawyers mounted a traditional self-defense case -- one that legal analysts say benefited from missteps by police and the prosecution.

Police investigators made mistakes including failing to preserve the crime scene or to widely canvass the neighborhood to interview witnesses in timely fashion, Ms. Lave said. Prosecutors were left ""working with one hand tied behind their back,"" she said.

A Sanford Police Department spokesman declined to comment. Former Sanford police chief Bill Lee, who was forced out amid the furor over Mr. Martin's case, has previously defended the integrity of the officers' investigation and said the department lacked probable cause to arrest Mr. Zimmerman.

Prosecutors made missteps as well, Ms. Lave said. Among them: introducing Mr. Zimmerman's statements to police into evidence. Their aim was to point out inconsistencies in his accounts. But the move allowed Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers to avoid calling him to the stand and subjecting him to cross-examination.

At a news conference Saturday night, state attorney Angela Corey defended her office's handling of the case. She said the case presented several challenges, including that the fatal encounter occurred in a public space, where both individuals had a right to be, rather than a dwelling.

The issue of race, which infused so much of the public debate over the case, rarely entered the courtroom discussion. Circuit Judge Debra Nelson barred prosecutors from saying Mr. Zimmerman racially profiled Mr. Martin. The topic mostly remained unspoken, such as when jurors heard phone calls Mr. Zimmerman placed to police to report suspicious people, all of whom were black.

Yet race could have been a factor in the jury's verdict, Ms. Lave said. The six female jurors were all white, except one who was Hispanic. ""You want to have people of color on your jury because sometimes their experience with police is something that white people don't have,"" she said.","George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, igniting a national debate on racial profiling and civil rights, was found not guilty late Saturday night of second-degree murder. He was also acquitted of manslaughter, a lesser charge.

After three weeks of testimony, the six-woman jury rejected the prosecution's contention that Mr. Zimmerman had deliberately pursued Mr. Martin because he assumed the hoodie-clad teenager was a criminal and instigated the fight that led to his death.

Mr. Zimmerman said he shot Mr. Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, in self-defense after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him and slammed his head repeatedly against the sidewalk. In finding him not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the jury agreed that Mr. Zimmerman could have been justified in shooting Mr. Martin because he feared great bodily harm or death.

The jury, which had been sequestered since June 24, deliberated 16 hours and 20 minutes over two days. The six female jurors entered the quiet, tense courtroom, several looking exhausted, their faces drawn and grim. After the verdict was read, each assented, one by one, quietly, their agreement with the verdict.

The case began in the small city of Sanford as a routine homicide but soon evolved into a civil rights cause examining racial profiling and its consequences -- an issue barred from the courtroom -- and setting off a broad discussion of race relations in America. Mr. Martin, with his gray hooded sweatshirt and his Skittles -- the candy he was carrying -- became its catalyst.

Even President Obama weighed in a month after the shooting, expressing sympathy for Mr. Martin's family and urging a thorough investigation. ""If I had a son,"" Mr. Obama said, ""he'd look like Trayvon.""

Saturday night when the verdict was read, Mr. Zimmerman, 29, smiled slightly. His wife, Shellie, and several of his friends wept, and his parents kissed and embraced.

Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who lost their son a few weeks after his 17th birthday, were not in the courtroom. In a statement released early Sunday, their attorney, Benjamin Crump, said the family was heartbroken, and that they thanked people around the world for their support.

""Trayvon Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till,"" he said, ""as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all.""

After the verdict, Judge Debra S. Nelson of Seminole County Court, told Mr. Zimmerman, who has been in hiding and wears a bulletproof vest outside, that his bond was released and his GPS monitor would be cut off. ""You have no further business with the court,"" she said.

Outside the courthouse, perhaps a hundred protesters who had been gathering through the night, their numbers building as the hours passed, began pumping their fists in the air, waving placards and chanting, ""No justice, no peace!"" Sheriff's deputies lined up inside the courthouse, watching the crowd, who were chanting peacefully, but intently.

By 11:20, more than an hour after the verdict had been read, the crowd outside the courtroom had begun to dwindle; fists were no longer aloft, placards had come down.

Among the last of the protesters to leave the courthouse lawn was Mattie Aikens, 33, of Sanford. She had been standing outside since noon, holding a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona watermelon drink, which Mr. Martin was carrying the night he was shot. More than an hour after the verdict, she was still shocked. ""He should have went to prison,"" she said. ""He should have just got guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.""

Mark O'Mara, one of Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers, said, ""George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except firing the gun in self-defense.""

In a news conference following the verdict, Angela B. Corey, the state attorney who brought the charges, rebuffed the suggestion that her office overcharged Mr. Zimmerman.

""We charged what we had based on the facts of the case,"" she said. ""We truly believe the mind-set of George Zimmerman and the reason he was doing what he did fit the bill for second-degree murder.""

Calling it a ""very trying time,"" Mr. Crump said he had urged Mr. Martin's parents to stay out of the courtroom for the verdict. They were home and planning to attend church on Sunday.

Mr. Crump asked the family's supporters keep the peace and read a Twitter post by Dr. Bernice King, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter.

""Whatever the Zimmerman verdict is,"" Mr. Crump read, ""in the words of my father, we must conduct ourselves on the higher plane of dignity and discipline.""

Sanford's new police chief, Cecil E. Smith, was in the courtroom for the verdict, and said afterward that while many calls were coming in from worried residents, the downtown was open and neighborhoods were calm.

Still, there was anger over the verdict. ""We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict,"" said Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the N.A.A.C.P. ""We stand with Trayvon's family and we are called to act. We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed.""

Mr. O'Mara disputed the notion that Mr. Zimmerman engaged in racial profiling. ""His history was not as a racist,"" he said.

He added that if Mr. Zimmerman was black, he likely would never have been charged. ""This became a focus for a civil rights event, which is a wonderful event to have,"" he said, ""but they decided George Zimmerman was to blame and to use as a civil rights violation.""

And while defense lawyers were elated with the verdict, they also expressed anger that Mr. Zimmerman spent 16 months filled with fear and trauma when all he was doing was defending himself.

""The prosecution of George Zimmerman was a disgrace,"" said Don West, one of Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers. ""I am thrilled that this jury kept this tragedy from become a travesty.""

The shooting brought attention to Florida's expansive self-defense laws. The laws allow someone with a reasonable fear of great bodily harm or death to use lethal force, even if retreating from danger is an option. In court, the gunman is given the benefit of the doubt.

The public outcry began after the police initially decided not to arrest Mr. Zimmerman, who is half-Peruvian, as they investigated the shooting. Mr. Martin, 17, had no criminal record and was on a snack run, returning to the house where he was staying as a guest.

Six weeks later, Mr. Zimmerman was arrested, but only after civil rights leaders championed the case and demonstrators, many wearing hoodies, marched in Sanford, Miami and elsewhere to demand action.

""Justice for Trayvon!"" they shouted.

The pressure prompted Gov. Rick Scott of Florida to remove local prosecutors from the case and appoint Ms. Corey, from Jacksonville. She ultimately charged Mr. Zimmerman with second-degree murder. The tumult also led to the firing of the Sanford police chief.

Through it all, Mr. Martin's parents said they sought one thing: That Mr. Zimmerman have his day in court.


From the start of the trial, prosecutors faced a difficult task in proving second-degree murder. That charge required Mr. Zimmerman to have evinced a ""depraved mind,"" brimming with ill will, hatred, spite or evil intent, when he shot Mr. Martin.

Manslaughter, which under Florida law is typically added as a lesser charge if either side requests it, was a lower bar. Jurors needed to decide only that Mr. Zimmerman put himself in a situation that culminated in Mr. Martin's death.

But because of Florida's laws, prosecutors had to persuade jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Zimmerman did not act in self-defense. A shortage of evidence in the case made that a high hurdle, legal experts said.

Even after three weeks of testimony, the fight between Mr. Martin and Mr. Zimmerman on that rainy night was a muddle, fodder for reasonable doubt. It remained unclear who had started it, who screamed for help, who threw the first punch and at what point Mr. Zimmerman drew his gun. There were no witnesses to the shooting.

The state presented a case that was strong on guesswork and emotion but weak on evidence and proof, Mr. O'Mara said.

""Don't connect those dots unless they are connected for you, beyond a reasonable doubt, by the state,"" he urged the jury.

In the end, prosecutors were left with Mr. Zimmerman's version of events.

The defense also had one piece of irrefutable evidence, photographs of Mr. Zimmerman's injuries -- a bloody nose along with lumps and two cuts on his head. It indicated that there had been a fight and that Mr. Zimmerman had been harmed, and the defense showed them to the jury at every opportunity.

Prosecutors built their case around Mr. Zimmerman's persona -- a ""wannabe cop"" -- his wrong assumptions and his words.

Mr. Zimmerman, they said, was so concerned about burglaries in his townhouse complex that when he spotted Mr. Martin, an unfamiliar face in the rain, he immediately ""profiled"" him as a criminal. He picked up his phone and reported him to the police.

Then he made the first in a string of bad choices, they said. He got out of the car with a gun on his waist; he disregarded a police dispatcher's advice not to follow Mr. Martin and he chased the teenager, engaged in a fight and shot him in the heart.

To stave off an arrest, he lied to the police, prosecutors said, embellishing his story to try to flesh out his self-defense claim.

""Punks,"" Mr. Zimmerman said to the police dispatcher after he spotted Mr. Martin, adding a profanity. ""They always get away,"" he said at another point in the conversation, a reference to would-be burglars.

On these words, prosecutors hung their case of ill will, hatred and spite toward Mr. Martin.

""This defendant was sick and tired of it,"" Bernie de la Rionda, the chief prosecutor, said in his closing statement. ""He was going to be what he wanted to be -- a police officer.""

But no one saw the shooting; witnesses saw and heard only parts of the struggle, and provided conflicting accounts.

And there was not a ""shred of evidence"" that Mr. Zimmerman was not returning to his car when Mr. Martin ""pounced,"" defense lawyers said.

The prosecution's witnesses did not always help their case. Rachel Jeantel, the 19-year-old who was talking with Mr. Martin on his cellphone shortly before he was shot, proved problematic. Her testimony was critical for the prosecution because she said that Mr. Martin was being followed by Mr. Zimmerman -- a ""creepy-ass cracker,"" he called him -- and that he was scared.

But Ms. Jeantel might have damaged her credibility by acknowledging she had lied about her age and why she did not attend Mr. Martin's wake. She also testified that she softened her initial account of her chat with Mr. Martin for fear of upsetting Ms. Fulton, who sat next to her, weeping, during Ms. Jeantel's first interview with prosecutors.

Prosecutors also were not helped by the police and crime scene technicians, who made some mistakes in the case. Mr. Martin's sweatshirt, for example, was improperly bagged, which might have degraded DNA evidence.

Typically, police testimony boosts the state's case. Here, the chief police investigator, Chris Serino, told jurors that he believed Mr. Zimmerman, despite contradictions in his statements.

Still, prosecutors had emotion on their side -- the heart-wrenching narrative of a teenager ""minding his own business"" who was gunned down as he walked home with a pocketful of Skittles and a fruit drink.

""That child had every right to do what he was doing, walking home,"" said John Guy, a prosecutor in the case. ""That child had every right to be afraid of a strange man following him, first in his car and then on foot. And did that child not have the right to defend himself from that strange man?""

Through it all, though, the defense chipped away at the prosecution's case. The resident with the best vantage point of the fight described a ""ground and pound"" fight, with a person in red or a light color on the bottom. Mr. Zimmerman wore a reddish jacket.

And a prominent forensic pathologist who is an expert in gunshot wounds testified that the trajectory of the bullet was consistent with Mr. Martin leaning over Mr. Zimmerman when the gun was fired.

""Let him go back,"" Mr. O'Mara said to the jury, referring to Mr. Zimmerman, ""and get back to his life.""

60,60,2013-08-29-LetFreedomRing.txt,"To the King family, who have sacrificed and inspired so much; to President Clinton; President Carter; Vice President Biden and Jill; fellow Americans.  

Five decades ago today, Americans came to this honored place to lay claim to a promise made at our founding:

    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

In 1963, almost 200 years after those words were set to paper, a full century after a great war was fought and emancipation proclaimed, that promise -- those truths -- remained unmet.  And so they came by the thousands from every corner of our country, men and women, young and old, blacks who longed for freedom and whites who could no longer accept freedom for themselves while witnessing the subjugation of others.

Across the land, congregations sent them off with food and with prayer.  In the middle of the night, entire blocks of Harlem came out to wish them well.  With the few dollars they scrimped from their labor, some bought tickets and boarded buses, even if they couldnât always sit where they wanted to sit.  Those with less money hitchhiked or walked.  They were seamstresses and steelworkers, students and teachers, maids and Pullman porters.  They shared simple meals and bunked together on floors.  And then, on a hot summer day, they assembled here, in our nationâs capital, under the shadow of the Great Emancipator -- to offer testimony of injustice, to petition their government for redress, and to awaken Americaâs long-slumbering conscience.

We rightly and best remember Dr. Kingâs soaring oratory that day, how he gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions; how he offered a salvation path for oppressed and oppressors alike.  His words belong to the ages, possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time.

But we would do well to recall that day itself also belonged to those ordinary people whose names never appeared in the history books, never got on TV.  Many had gone to segregated schools and sat at segregated lunch counters.  They lived in towns where they couldnât vote and cities where their votes didnât matter.  They were couples in love who couldnât marry, soldiers who fought for freedom abroad that they found denied to them at home.  They had seen loved ones beaten, and children fire-hosed, and they had every reason to lash out in anger, or resign themselves to a bitter fate.

And yet they chose a different path.  In the face of hatred, they prayed for their tormentors.  In the face of violence, they stood up and sat in, with the moral force of nonviolence.  Willingly, they went to jail to protest unjust laws, their cells swelling with the sound of freedom songs.  A lifetime of indignities had taught them that no man can take away the dignity and grace that God grants us.  They had learned through hard experience what Frederick Douglass once taught -- that freedom is not given, it must be won, through struggle and discipline, persistence and faith.

That was the spirit they brought here that day.  That was the spirit young people like John Lewis brought to that day.  That was the spirit that they carried with them, like a torch, back to their cities and their neighborhoods.  That steady flame of conscience and courage that would sustain them through the campaigns to come -- through boycotts and voter registration drives and smaller marches far from the spotlight; through the loss of four little girls in Birmingham, and the carnage of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and the agony of Dallas and California and Memphis.  Through setbacks and heartbreaks and gnawing doubt, that flame of justice flickered; it never died.

And because they kept marching, America changed.  Because they marched, a Civil Rights law was passed.  Because they marched, a Voting Rights law was signed.  Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody elseâs laundry or shining somebody elseâs shoes.  Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed, and Congress changed, and, yes, eventually, the White House changed.

Because they marched, America became more free and more fair -- not just for African Americans, but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans; for Catholics, Jews, and Muslims; for gays, for Americans with a disability.  America changed for you and for me.  and the entire world drew strength from that example, whether the young people who watched from the other side of an Iron Curtain and would eventually tear down that wall, or the young people inside South Africa who would eventually end the scourge of apartheid.

Those are the victories they won, with iron wills and hope in their hearts.  That is the transformation that they wrought, with each step of their well-worn shoes.  Thatâs the debt that I and millions of Americans owe those maids, those laborers, those porters, those secretaries; folks who could have run a company maybe if they had ever had a chance; those white students who put themselves in harmâs way, even though they didn't have; those Japanese Americans who recalled their own internment; those Jewish Americans who had survived the Holocaust; people who could have given up and given in, but kept on keeping on, knowing that âweeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.â

On the battlefield of justice, men and women without rank or wealth or title or fame would liberate us all in ways that our children now take for granted, as people of all colors and creeds live together and learn together and walk together, and fight alongside one another, and love one another, and judge one another by the content of our character in this greatest nation on Earth.

To dismiss the magnitude of this progress -- to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed -- that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years. Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, Martin Luther King Jr. -- they did not die in vain.  Their victory was great. 

But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete.  The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesnât bend on its own.  To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency.  Whether by challenging those who erect new barriers to the vote, or ensuring that the scales of justice work equally for all, and the criminal justice system is not simply a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails, it requires vigilance.

And we'll suffer the occasional setback.  But we will win these fights.  This country has changed too much.  People of goodwill, regardless of party, are too plentiful for those with ill will to change historyâs currents.

In some ways, though, the securing of civil rights, voting rights, the eradication of legalized discrimination -- the very significance of these victories may have obscured a second goal of the March.  For the men and women who gathered 50 years ago were not there in search of some abstract ideal.  They were there seeking jobs as well as justice -- not just the absence of oppression but the presence of economic opportunity.

For what does it profit a man, Dr. King would ask, to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he canât afford the meal?  This idea -- that oneâs liberty is linked to oneâs livelihood; that the pursuit of happiness requires the dignity of work, the skills to find work, decent pay, some measure of material security -- this idea was not new.  Lincoln himself understood the Declaration of Independence in such terms -- as a promise that in due time, âthe weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance.â  

And Dr. King explained that the goals of African Americans were identical to working people of all races:  âDecent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old-age security, health and welfare measures, conditions in which families can grow, have education for their children, and respect in the community.â

What King was describing has been the dream of every American.  It's what's lured for centuries new arrivals to our shores.  And itâs along this second dimension -- of economic opportunity, the chance through honest toil to advance oneâs station in life -- where the goals of 50 years ago have fallen most short. 

Yes, there have been examples of success within black America that would have been unimaginable a half century ago.  But as has already been noted, black unemployment has remained almost twice as high as white unemployment, Latino unemployment close behind.  The gap in wealth between races has not lessened, it's grown.  And as President Clinton indicated, the position of all working Americans, regardless of color, has eroded, making the dream Dr. King described even more elusive. 

For over a decade, working Americans of all races have seen their wages and incomes stagnate, even as corporate profits soar, even as the pay of a fortunate few explodes.  Inequality has steadily risen over the decades.  Upward mobility has become harder.  In too many communities across this country, in cities and suburbs and rural hamlets, the shadow of poverty casts a pall over our youth, their lives a fortress of substandard schools and diminished prospects, inadequate health care and perennial violence. 

And so as we mark this anniversary, we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks could join the ranks of millionaires.  It was whether this country would admit all people who are willing to work hard regardless of race into the ranks of a middle-class life.

The test was not, and never has been, whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few.  It was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many -- for the black custodian and the white steelworker, the immigrant dishwasher and the Native American veteran.  To win that battle, to answer that call -- this remains our great unfinished business. 

We shouldnât fool ourselves.  The task will not be easy.  Since 1963, the economy has changed.  The twin forces of technology and global competition have subtracted those jobs that once provided a foothold into the middle class -- reduced the bargaining power of American workers.  And our politics has suffered.  Entrenched interests, those who benefit from an unjust status quo, resisted any government efforts to give working families a fair deal -- marshaling an army of lobbyists and opinion makers to argue that minimum wage increases or stronger labor laws or taxes on the wealthy who could afford it just to fund crumbling schools, that all these things violated sound economic principles.  We'd be told that growing inequality was a price for a growing economy, a measure of this free market; that greed was good and compassion ineffective, and those without jobs or health care had only themselves to blame.

And then, there were those elected officials who found it useful to practice the old politics of division, doing their best to convince middle-class Americans of a great untruth -- that government was somehow itself to blame for their growing economic insecurity; that distant bureaucrats were taking their hard-earned dollars to benefit the welfare cheat or the illegal immigrant.

And then, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that during the course of 50 years, there were times when some of us claiming to push for change lost our way.  The anguish of assassinations set off self-defeating riots.  Legitimate grievances against police brutality tipped into excuse-making for criminal behavior.  Racial politics could cut both ways, as the transformative message of unity and brotherhood was drowned out by the language of recrimination.  And what had once been a call for equality of opportunity, the chance for all Americans to work hard and get ahead was too often framed as a mere desire for government support -- as if we had no agency in our own liberation, as if poverty was an excuse for not raising your child, and the bigotry of others was reason to give up on yourself.

All of that history is how progress stalled.  That's how hope was diverted.  It's how our country remained divided.  But the good news is, just as was true in 1963, we now have a choice. We can continue down our current path, in which the gears of this great democracy grind to a halt and our children accept a life of lower expectations; where politics is a zero-sum game where a few do very well while struggling families of every race fight over a shrinking economic pie -- thatâs one path.  Or we can have the courage to change. 

The March on Washington teaches us that we are not trapped by the mistakes of history; that we are masters of our fate.  But it also teaches us that the promise of this nation will only be kept when we work together.  Weâll have to reignite the embers of empathy and fellow feeling, the coalition of conscience that found expression in this place 50 years ago. 

And I believe that spirit is there, that truth force inside each of us.  I see it when a white mother recognizes her own daughter in the face of a poor black child.  I see it when the black youth thinks of his own grandfather in the dignified steps of an elderly white man.  Itâs there when the native-born recognizing that striving spirit of the new immigrant; when the interracial couple connects the pain of a gay couple who are discriminated against and understands it as their own. 

Thatâs where courage comes from -- when we turn not from each other, or on each other, but towards one another, and we find that we do not walk alone.  Thatâs where courage comes from.

And with that courage, we can stand together for good jobs and just wages.  With that courage, we can stand together for the right to health care in the richest nation on Earth for every person.  With that courage, we can stand together for the right of every child, from the corners of Anacostia to the hills of Appalachia, to get an education that stirs the mind and captures the spirit, and prepares them for the world that awaits them.

With that courage, we can feed the hungry, and house the homeless, and transform bleak wastelands of poverty into fields of commerce and promise.

America, I know the road will be long, but I know we can get there.  Yes, we will stumble, but I know weâll get back up.  Thatâs how a movement happens.  Thatâs how history bends.  That's how when somebody is faint of heart, somebody else brings them along and says, come on, weâre marching.

Thereâs a reason why so many who marched that day, and in the days to come, were young -- for the young are unconstrained by habits of fear, unconstrained by the conventions of what is.  They dared to dream differently, to imagine something better.  And I am convinced that same imagination, the same hunger of purpose stirs in this generation.

We might not face the same dangers of 1963, but the fierce urgency of now remains.  We may never duplicate the swelling crowds and dazzling procession of that day so long ago -- no one can match Kingâs brilliance -- but the same flame that lit the heart of all who are willing to take a first step for justice, I know that flame remains.

That tireless teacher who gets to class early and stays late and dips into her own pocket to buy supplies because she believes that every child is her charge -- sheâs marching.

That successful businessman who doesn't have to but pays his workers a fair wage and then offers a shot to a man, maybe an ex-con who is down on his luck -- heâs marching.

The mother who pours her love into her daughter so that she grows up with the confidence to walk through the same door as anybodyâs son -- sheâs marching.

The father who realizes the most important job heâll ever have is raising his boy right, even if he didn't have a father -- especially if he didn't have a father at home -- heâs marching.

The battle-scarred veterans who devote themselves not only to helping their fellow warriors stand again, and walk again, and run again, but to keep serving their country when they come home -- they are marching.

Everyone who realizes what those glorious patriots knew on that day -- that change does not come from Washington, but to Washington; that change has always been built on our willingness, We The People, to take on the mantle of citizenship -- you are marching.

And thatâs the lesson of our past.  That's the promise of tomorrow -- that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.  That when millions of Americans of every race and every region, every faith and every station, can join together in a spirit of brotherhood, then those mountains will be made low, and those rough places will be made plain, and those crooked places, they straighten out towards grace, and we will vindicate the faith of those who sacrificed so much and live up to the true meaning of our creed, as one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
","From the spot where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. relayed his vision of a color-blind nation, President Barack Obama on Wednesday called on Americans to work toward greater racial equality and economic opportunity.

The president was joined by a parade of dignitaries, stars and civil-rights leaders in commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom that paved the way for civil-rights legislation.

The observance took place on a steamy, drizzly day, but a celebratory mood took hold as marchers followed a 1.6-mile route from Capitol Hill and packed the park surrounding the Lincoln Memorial, where Mr. Obama and others spoke.

Mr. Obama, recalling Dr. King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech to the marchers in 1963, used his remarks to link the black civil-rights struggle to the goal of offering ""a fair shot"" at reaching the middle class to all Americans, regardless of race.

Mr. Obama noted that the marchers five decades ago ""were there seeking jobs as well as justice; not just the absence of oppression but the presence of economic opportunity."" He added: ""For what does it profit a man, Dr. King would ask, to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he can't afford the meal?""

Topping a week of commemorative events, Wednesday's official program featured dignitaries including former presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and civil-rights leaders such as Georgia Rep. John Lewis, the only surviving speaker from the 1963 march, who led the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee at the time.

Former President George W. Bush had been invited but declined due to a recent heart stent procedure, his office said.

Celebrities from Forest Whitaker to Oprah Winfrey also spoke, as did Dr. King's sister, Christine King Farris, who said that ""Martin's dream is a vision not yet to be realized, a dream yet unfilled, and we have much to do before we can celebrate the dream as reality, as the suppression of voting rights and horrific violence. . .has so painfully demonstrated.""

That unfinished business was the informal theme of the day. Stanley Miller, 58, a retired Washington, D.C., bus driver, said during the march that he fears younger people have ""let the reins go."" Young African-Americans, Mr. Miller said, have benefited from 50 years of struggle, and are now caught up in the need to get ahead and don't fully understand or appreciate the movement's history of sacrifice.

At Wednesday's observance Mr. Lewis, who was nearly killed several times while leading protests in the segregated South, drew wild applause and tears with his remarks on the history of the movement and the remaining work to be done.

""Sometime I hear people saying nothing has changed, but for someone to grow up the way I grew up in the cotton fields of Alabama to now be serving in the U.S. Congress makes me want to tell them come and walk in my shoes,"" Mr. Lewis said to cheers.

Mr. Obama spoke of racial disparities, saying that amid the many advances for African-Americans over 50 years, black unemployment ""has remained almost twice as high as white unemployment"" and that ""the gap in wealth between the races has not lessened; it's grown.""

But he also cast the nation's economic challenges as transcending race, saying that ""the position of all working Americans, regardless of color, has eroded"" amid wage stagnation and weakening prospects for upward mobility.

He described economic inequality in stark terms, drawing a contrast between impoverished youth facing ""diminished prospects"" and the ""fortunate few"" benefiting from exploding corporate profits.

Many who turned out for the day's events said they felt like they were part of history.

Cassandra Martin, 42, a nurse from Washington, D.C., said the issues facing the country today aren't that different than those of 1963. ""What was then is still relevant today,"" she said.

Rodger Selby, a 17-year-old high-school student from Philadelphia, said that while racism can't be fully eliminated, ""with these sorts of events, it gets weaker and weaker.""","President Obama stepped into the space on Wednesday where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once stood, summoning his iconic dream of a colorblind society in a celebration of a half-century of progress and a call to arms for the next generation.

On a day of overcast skies and misty rain, tens of thousands of Americans -- black, white and every shade in between -- returned to the site of Dr. King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech to listen to the nation's first black president pay tribute to the pioneers who paved the way for his own ascension to the heights of American government.

""Because they kept marching, America changed,"" the president said as Dr. King's family watched. ""Because they marched, a civil rights law was passed. Because they marched, a voting rights law was signed. Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody else's laundry or shining somebody else's shoes.

""Because they marched,"" he added, ""city councils changed and state legislatures changed and Congress changed and, yes, eventually, the White House changed.""

The symbolic journey from Dr. King to Mr. Obama on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial animated the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom more than any oratory. While Mr. Obama's line about the White House changing was his only reference to his unique place in history, the power of his presence was lost on no one.

But it also underscored the challenge to a movement to reframe its mission for a new era. With an African-American in the Oval Office, it is harder to argue about political empowerment than it was in 1963, and much of the day's message centered on tackling persistent economic disparity, as well as newer frontiers of civil rights like equality for gay men and lesbians.

Several of the speakers, including former President Jimmy Carter, tied the historic nature of the event to controversies of the moment, including the Trayvon Martin case, New York's police frisking policy and the Supreme Court ruling this summer that overturned part of the Voting Rights Act. ""I think we know how Dr. King would have reacted,"" Mr. Carter said.

Yet former President Bill Clinton said that for all of the current challenges, Americans have never had more opportunity to shape the future if they can put aside their differences. ""It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back,"" he said.

The three presidents effectively reflected three eras in the civil rights movement: Mr. Carter, the white Southerner who appointed more African-Americans to high-ranking positions than did any of his predecessors; Mr. Clinton, who was so attuned to race issues that he was called the country's first black president; and Mr. Obama, who really is the first and who represents the generation that came of age after the battles of the past.

Hillary Rodham Clinton, who may seek to be the next president, did not attend, and aides declined to explain why. But on hand were Caroline Kennedy and Lynda Johnson Robb, daughters of the two presidents most associated with civil rights, as well as a phalanx of celebrities, like Oprah Winfrey, Bill Russell, Jamie Foxx and Forest Whitaker.

Some lions of the civil rights era were there, including Representative John Lewis, former Ambassador Andrew Young and the Rev. Joseph Lowery -- grayer, thicker, slower, but stirring emotions of their youth. ""We ain't going back,"" Dr. Lowery declared. ""We ain't going back. We've come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice.""

Many members of Dr. King's family participated as well, including his 85-year-old sister, Christine King Farris. The Rev. Bernice King, his daughter, noted that women were largely missing from the speakers list in 1963, but they were a significant presence 50 years later. She delivered a rousing call to ""let freedom ring"" before the ringing of a bell saved from the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., where a bombing by the Ku Klux Klan killed four girls just weeks after Dr. King's speech.

Although Republican lawmakers were critical to the passage of civil rights legislation in the 1960s, no prominent party leaders were on stage on Wednesday. The two living former Republican presidents, George Bush and George W. Bush, both cited health in missing the occasion. The Republican National Committee held a luncheon honoring the march on Monday, and party leaders issued statements, including the younger Mr. Bush and Mitt Romney.

""Dr. King was on this earth just 39 years, but the ideals that guided his life of conscience and purpose are eternal,"" Mr. Bush said. ""Honoring him requires the commitment of every one of us.""

At age 52, Mr. Obama is too young to remember the march, and, raised in Hawaii as the son of a white mother and a father from Kenya, his own connection to the civil rights movement is more distant than, say, that of his wife, Michelle, whose parents grew up in segregated America. But he clearly felt the pressure to live up to the moment on Wednesday, noting that ""no one can match King's brilliance.""

More sober than stirring until near the end, when he adopted more of a preacher's cadence, Mr. Obama used his 29-minute address, nearly twice as long as Dr. King's original, to argue for a renewed mission to ensure that opportunity is available not just for a few but for the many, for ""the black custodian,"" ""the white steelworker"" and ""the immigrant dishwasher.""

""The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice,"" the president said, adopting a line from Dr. King, ""but it doesn't bend on its own. To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency.""

He was to a large extent preaching to the choir. This was a crowd of supporters, many from the Washington area, and to them, it was a day to reflect not only on Dr. King's legacy but also on Mr. Obama's. Those old enough to remember the march marveled at a black president's standing where Dr. King had.

""If you say that's not the fruition of the dream, I don't know what is,"" said Bill Carr, a licensed clinical social worker from Montclair, N.J., who is black.

Nearby stood Bill Tate, a retired engineer who is white and who wore a button from the original march, when he was a student at the University of Maryland. ""Who would have guessed 50 years ago that in less than 50 years we would re-elect -- re-elect! -- a black president?"" he asked. ""No one can deny that we've made some progress.""

Among the witnesses to that progress was Gil Lyons, who worked for the Postal Service at the time and was told his pay would be docked if he attended the march. Now 82, he works as a Park Service interpreter, teaching visitors about national monuments, including the new King Memorial.

Mr. Lyons recalled being moved to tears by Dr. King's address. ""I felt that something good was going to happen to America, and look at 1600,"" he said, referring to the White House. ""People said we would have a black president. I said to myself I probably would never see one. But what can I say? In my time, Obama came along.""

William Andrew Allison, 92, was also there that day, and he has kept a sign from the march in his closet ever since. Mr. Allison took it out of storage on Wednesday and had it with him as he sat on a bench between the White House and the Mall. ""I thought I'd come back,"" he said. ""It had been 50 years.""

Still, some changes since then were more disconcerting. Snipers kept watch from the roof of the Lincoln Memorial, while the three presidents sat behind a clear bulletproof shield. Security barriers discouraged many from moving about freely, and risers for news media cameras blocked the view of the Lincoln Memorial.

If the 1963 march had an air of freedom and spontaneity, the event on Wednesday felt at times choreographed and forced. When Mr. Young addressed the crowd, he did so in song, delivering a moving rendition of ""Woke Up This Morning With My Mind Stayed on Freedom."" But when he implored the crowd to join in, the few who did could barely be heard.

""We're not here to declare victory,"" Mr. Young later told the crowd. ""We're here to simply say that the struggle continues.""",2013-08-29,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.950, NEU: 0.048, NEG: 0.001})",0.9501538276672363,0.04839826375246048,0.001447900547645986,"AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.892, NEU: 0.107, NEG: 0.001})","AnalyzerOutput(output=POS, probas={POS: 0.853, NEU: 0.145, NEG: 0.002})",0.8915956616401672,0.10713549703359604,0.0012688653077930212,0.8532681465148926,0.14522409439086914,0.0015077984426170588
61,61,2013-09-11-SyriaPolicy.txt,"My fellow Americans, tonight I want to talk to you about Syria -- why it matters, and where we go from here.

Over the past two years, what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad has turned into a brutal civil war.  Over 100,000 people have been killed.  Millions have fled the country.  In that time, America has worked with allies to provide humanitarian support, to help the moderate opposition, and to shape a political settlement.  But I have resisted calls for military action, because we cannot resolve someone elseâs civil war through force, particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The situation profoundly changed, though, on August 21st, when Assadâs government gassed to death over a thousand people, including hundreds of children.  The images from this massacre are sickening:  Men, women, children lying in rows, killed by poison gas.  Others foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath.  A father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk.  On that terrible night, the world saw in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapons, and why the overwhelming majority of humanity has declared them off-limits -- a crime against humanity, and a violation of the laws of war.

This was not always the case.  In World War I, American GIs were among the many thousands killed by deadly gas in the trenches of Europe.  In World War II, the Nazis used gas to inflict the horror of the Holocaust.  Because these weapons can kill on a mass scale, with no distinction between soldier and infant, the civilized world has spent a century working to ban them.  And in 1997, the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved an international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical weapons, now joined by 189 governments that represent 98 percent of humanity.

On August 21st, these basic rules were violated, along with our sense of common humanity.  No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria.  The world saw thousands of videos, cell phone pictures, and social media accounts from the attack, and humanitarian organizations told stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas.

Moreover, we know the Assad regime was responsible.  In the days leading up to August 21st, we know that Assadâs chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an area where they mix sarin gas.  They distributed gasmasks to their troops.  Then they fired rockets from a regime-controlled area into 11 neighborhoods that the regime has been trying to wipe clear of opposition forces.  Shortly after those rockets landed, the gas spread, and hospitals filled with the dying and the wounded.  We know senior figures in Assadâs military machine reviewed the results of the attack, and the regime increased their shelling of the same neighborhoods in the days that followed.  Weâve also studied samples of blood and hair from people at the site that tested positive for sarin.

When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory.  But these things happened.  The facts cannot be denied. The question now is what the United States of America, and the international community, is prepared to do about it.  Because what happened to those people -- to those children -- is not only a violation of international law, itâs also a danger to our security.

Let me explain why.  If we fail to act, the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons.  As the ban against these weapons erodes, other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas, and using them.  Over time, our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield.  And it could be easier for terrorist organizations to obtain these weapons, and to use them to attack civilians. 

If fighting spills beyond Syriaâs borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan, and Israel.  And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction, and embolden Assadâs ally, Iran -- which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon, or to take a more peaceful path.

This is not a world we should accept.  This is whatâs at stake.  And that is why, after careful deliberation, I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regimeâs use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike.  The purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, to degrade his regimeâs ability to use them, and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use. 

That's my judgment as Commander-in-Chief.  But Iâm also the President of the worldâs oldest constitutional democracy.  So even though I possess the authority to order military strikes, I believed it was right, in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security, to take this debate to Congress.  I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress.  And I believe that America acts more effectively abroad when we stand together. 

This is especially true after a decade that put more and more war-making power in the hands of the President, and more and more burdens on the shoulders of our troops, while sidelining the peopleâs representatives from the critical decisions about when we use force.

Now, I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action, no matter how limited, is not going to be popular.  After all, I've spent four and a half years working to end wars, not to start them.  Our troops are out of Iraq.  Our troops are coming home from Afghanistan.  And I know Americans want all of us in Washington -- especially me -- to concentrate on the task of building our nation here at home:  putting people back to work, educating our kids, growing our middle class.

Itâs no wonder, then, that you're asking hard questions.  So let me answer some of the most important questions that I've heard from members of Congress, and that I've read in letters that you've sent to me.

First, many of you have asked, wonât this put us on a slippery slope to another war?  One man wrote to me that we are âstill recovering from our involvement in Iraq.â  A veteran put it more bluntly:  âThis nation is sick and tired of war.â

My answer is simple:  I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.  I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.  I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.  This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective:  deterring the use of chemical weapons, and degrading Assadâs capabilities.

Others have asked whether it's worth acting if we donât take out Assad.  As some members of Congress have said, thereâs no point in simply doing a âpinprickâ strike in Syria.

Let me make something clear:  The United States military doesnât do pinpricks.  Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver.  I don't think we should remove another dictator with force -- we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next.  But a targeted strike can make Assad, or any other dictator, think twice before using chemical weapons.

Other questions involve the dangers of retaliation.  We donât dismiss any threats, but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military.  Any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day.  Neither Assad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise.  And our ally, Israel, can defend itself with overwhelming force, as well as the unshakeable support of the United States of America.

Many of you have asked a broader question:  Why should we get involved at all in a place that's so complicated, and where  -- as one person wrote to me -- âthose who come after Assad may be enemies of human rights?â

Itâs true that some of Assadâs opponents are extremists.  But al Qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria if people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from being gassed to death.  The majority of the Syrian people -- and the Syrian opposition we work with -- just want to live in peace, with dignity and freedom.  And the day after any military action, we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism.

Finally, many of you have asked:  Why not leave this to other countries, or seek solutions short of force?  As several people wrote to me, âWe should not be the worldâs policeman.â

I agree, and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions.  Over the last two years, my administration has tried diplomacy and sanctions, warning and negotiations -- but chemical weapons were still used by the Assad regime.

However, over the last few days, weâve seen some encouraging signs.  In part because of the credible threat of U.S. military action, as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin, the Russian government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Assad to give up his chemical weapons.  The Assad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons, and even said theyâd join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits their use. 

Itâs too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.  But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assadâs strongest allies.

I have, therefore, asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path.  Iâm sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday, and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin.  Iâve spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies, France and the United Kingdom, and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons, and to ultimately destroy them under international control.  Weâll also give U.N. inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about what happened on August 21st.  And we will continue to rally support from allies from Europe to the Americas -- from Asia to the Middle East -- who agree on the need for action. 

Meanwhile, Iâve ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad, and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.  And tonight, I give thanks again to our military and their families for their incredible strength and sacrifices.

My fellow Americans, for nearly seven decades, the United States has been the anchor of global security.  This has meant doing more than forging international agreements -- it has meant enforcing them.  The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world is a better place because we have borne them. 

And so, to my friends on the right, I ask you to reconcile your commitment to Americaâs military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just.  To my friends on the left, I ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those images of children writhing in pain, and going still on a cold hospital floor.  For sometimes resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough.

Indeed, Iâd ask every member of Congress, and those of you watching at home tonight, to view those videos of the attack, and then ask:  What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas, and we choose to look the other way?

Franklin Roosevelt once said, âOur national determination to keep free of foreign wars and foreign entanglements cannot prevent us from feeling deep concern when ideals and principles that we have cherished are challenged.â  Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria, along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used.

America is not the worldâs policeman.  Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong.  But when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act.  Thatâs what makes America different.  Thatâs what makes us exceptional.  With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth. 

Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama told Americans Tuesday he would pursue a newly energized diplomatic course to try to resolve the standoff with Syria, but he insisted that the U.S. must conduct military strikes, if needed, in response to the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons.

Mr. Obama said in a televised address that he asked Congress to postpone a vote on a resolution to authorize military force, which he looked likely to lose. Instead he said he would reserve the option of military strikes while pursuing a Russian proposal for Syria to hand over its chemical-weapons under an international agreement.

""It's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed,"" Mr. Obama said, ""and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.""

Mr. Obama's address, which showed no immediate sign of changing minds in Congress, came on a day of fast-moving developments in which U.S. lawmakers and officials from France, Russia and other nations scrambled to develop proposals under which Syria would relinquish its chemical weapons.

Syria for the first time directly admitted that it possesses chemical weapons and said it would cease their production and disclose the locations of the stockpiles to the international community, including the United Nations and Russia, which is at the center of the negotiations.

While Mr. Obama agreed to explore the possibility of a Syrian chemical-weapons handover, his administration expressed skepticism that a deal could be reached, and a dispute emerged quickly among members of the U.N. Security Council over how such a measure could be enforced, with France seeking language that leaves military action on the table and Russia rejecting such a move.

Secretary of State John Kerry, who will meet Thursday with his Russian counterpart in Geneva to continue talks, told Congress Tuesday that reaching any agreement on details of a chemical-weapons plan would be ""exceedingly difficult.""

The speech showed Mr. Obama trying to navigate a difficult political environment. With support for military strikes eroding in Congress, and the president facing the prospect of an embarrassing defeat, Mr. Obama said he was committed to pursuing negotiations to rid Syria of chemical weapons that only days ago had seemed to come to a dead end.

At the same time, he sought to build support during his 15-minute address for the idea that strikes could be needed, as he discussed the Syrian regime's alleged chemical-weapons attack on Aug. 21 that the U.S. says killed more than 1,400 of its own citizens, including children, outside Damascus.

""Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn't do pinpricks,"""" he said. ""Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver."" He said he had ordered the military ""to maintain our current posture and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.""

At the same time, Mr. Obama acknowledged that the limits of U.S. power to resolve the Syrian civil war and that military action, ""no matter how limited, is not going to be popular"""" after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said any U.S. action would be constrained: ""I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria,"""" he said. ""I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan. . .This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective: deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's capabilities.""

Initial reaction to Mr. Obama's speech suggested that he hadn't changed minds in Congress.

Rep. Trey Radel (R., Fla.) said the speech hadn't altered his stance that taking military action against Syria would be a mistake. ""It still leaves me and the American people confused,"" Mr. Radel, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said after the speech, pointing to what he described as conflicting descriptions from the administration of how much force would be used in Syria. ""Is this a slap on the wrist or is it an actual bombing campaign?""

Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), who had opposed a Senate resolution authorizing military force in Syria, said his position hadn't shifted. ""If you think military might and money will change the outcome in that part of the world, then we'd have done it by now,"" Mr. Manchin said in an interview after the speech. He said he was encouraged by the president's talk of diplomatic options.

Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) said he supported the president's diplomatic efforts but that Congress should still vote to support a military strategy to keep up pressure on Syria.

After the diplomatic opening materialized Monday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) canceled an initial test vote in the Senate for Wednesday. On Tuesday, after meeting with the president and Senate Democrats at the Capitol, Mr. Reid said the vote has been put on hold indefinitely, pending the outcome of diplomatic efforts.

The timing of any Senate vote will be dictated by international ""developments taking place, not some artificial timeline,"" Mr. Reid said.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) said the president asked senators to give him time to size up the diplomatic opportunity. ""He needs a number of days,"" said Mr. Durbin. ""The president was not overly optimistic about it.""

U.S. military officials said Tuesday that the latest developments wouldn't prompt them to move any forces or take American ships off alert. Pentagon officials said they were aware of potential plans for a U.N. resolution, but they didn't know that it would materialize.

The reaction showed that Mr. Kerry's off-the-cuff comments Monday -- which opened the door to the latest diplomatic scramble by saying the U.S. would be receptive to a plan under which Syria turned over its chemical weapons -- wasn't coordinated across the government.

""It was an accident on one hand, and not an accident on the other,"" said a senior U.S. official.

Amid the move to delay votes in Congress, a bipartisan group of senior senators began reworking the language of a potential resolution on the use of force, reacting to eroding support among lawmakers and developments at the U.N.

They were drafting an amendment that would call for the U.N. to pass a measure declaring that Syria had used chemical weapons and to remove them by a certain date, which lawmakers were still negotiating, a person familiar with the effort said. If the weapons weren't removed by that deadline, the resolution would authorize the president to launch limited military action.

The bipartisan group included John McCain (R., Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), and Bob Menendez (D., N.J.).

Authors of the bill hoped that the changes would build support among lawmakers who were opposed to force, or on the fence, by putting more emphasis on diplomatic efforts. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.), who had opposed the initial Senate resolution, said she was open to an alternative.

The rapid turn of events from Moscow to Damascus to Washington followed two weeks of remarkable twists in Mr. Obama's push to follow through on a red line he set last year against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons.

The U.S. was on the brink of unilateral military strikes against Syria when Mr. Obama made the surprise announcement on Aug. 31 that he would seek the backing of Congress.

Then, on Monday, the White House found itself inadvertently in negotiations with Russia over a diplomatic endgame after Mr. Kerry opened the door to the talks in unscripted comments.

U.S. lawmakers and administration officials remain skeptical any such proposal would work.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said in a statement he read to a pro-regime Lebanese TV station, al-Mayadeen, that Damascus would cease production of chemical weapons and disclose the locations of its stockpiles to the United Nations, Russia and others.

France said it would submit a resolution to the U.N. Security Council aimed at forcing Syria to give international inspectors full access to its chemical stockpile and allow for its swift dismantlement.

Russia called the resolution ""unacceptable,"" citing the French proposal's use of a U.N. measure that would potentially authorize the use of force, as well as language that laid blame for using chemical weapons on Syria's government. Russia said it would instead propose a draft declaration backing an initiative to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control.","President Obama, facing implacable opposition to a strike in Syria in Congress and throughout the country, said Tuesday that he would hold off on military action for now and pursue a Russian proposal for international monitors to take over and destroy Syria's arsenal of chemical weapons.

Speaking to the nation from the White House, Mr. Obama laid out his most extensive and detailed case for an attack to punish Syria for its use of chemical weapons. But he also acknowledged the deep doubts of Americans who after the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan view any form of military engagement in Syria with alarm.

In a speech that only 48 hours ago was going to be solely a call to arms, Mr. Obama instead offered a qualified endorsement of a proposal that his own advisers conceded was rife with risk, given Russia's steadfast refusal to agree to any previous measures to pressure Syria, its longtime ally.

""It's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments,"" Mr. Obama said. ""But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.""

The president said he had asked Congressional leaders to postpone a vote authorizing military action -- a vote he was almost certain to lose -- even while making the moral case for punishing Syria for its deadly use of chemical weapons. What Mr. Obama did not say was how long he was willing to wait, what would convince him that the Russian proposal was credible, and what he would do if it was not.

For Mr. Obama, the 16-minute address from the East Room was a frank acknowledgment of how radically the political and diplomatic landscape had shifted in just a few days. With officials on Capitol Hill, at the United Nations and in foreign capitals flocking to embrace Russia's plan as an alternative to force, Mr. Obama found himself struggling to redefine the terms of the debate.

His speech capped a day of rapid-fire developments as the United Nations Security Council scheduled and then canceled a meeting, Syria embraced the Russian proposal, and Mr. Obama sent Secretary of State John Kerry to Geneva for two days of negotiations with his Russian counterpart.

Even in the face of widespread opposition, Mr. Obama made an impassioned case for a retaliatory strike, saying in starkly emotional terms that President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons could not be tolerated.

""The images from this massacre are sickening,"" Mr. Obama said, ""Men, women, and children lying in rows, killed by poison gas, others foaming at mouth, gasping for breath, a father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk.""

Mr. Obama also framed his case in political terms. He asked those on the right to reconcile their commitment to America's military might with a failure to act now. And he asked those on left to reconcile their belief in freedom and dignity ""with those images of children writhing in pain and going still on a cold hospital floor.""

""For sometimes,"" he said, ""resolutions and statements of condemnation are not enough.""

Yet for now at least, the debate will focus on the language of diplomacy -- and particularly a Russian plan that has stirred doubt among administration officials, lawmakers and diplomats. Some of them said it would allow Syria to play for time and was calculated to undermine the drive for Congressional and international support for a strike. Others said the idea of securing chemical weapons stockpiles in the midst of a brutal civil war was fanciful.

Moreover, the diplomatic efforts -- which began after Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, announced his proposal on Monday -- quickly ran into trouble. A meeting of the United Nations Security Council was canceled Tuesday afternoon after Russia clashed with the United States and France over whether to make its proposal binding and back it up with the threat of force.

""We need a full resolution from the Security Council to have the confidence that this has the force it ought to have,"" Mr. Kerry said in a social media interview sponsored by Google. ""Right now the Russians are in a slightly different place on that.""

Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov will meet in Geneva on Thursday to work out these disagreements. Before Russia made its announcement, Mr. Kerry expressed blunt skepticism that Syria could be trusted to turn over its stockpile, which is dispersed around the country. In testimony to Congress on Tuesday, he described the Obama administration's position on the Russian plan.

""It has to be swift, it has to be real, it has to be verifiable,"" Mr. Kerry told the House Armed Services Committee. ""It cannot be a delaying tactic.""

In signaling his country's cooperation, the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said Tuesday that Damascus would turn over its chemical weapons arsenal to Russia, the United Nations and ""other countries"" -- a startling concession, given that as recently as this week Mr. Assad had disputed that Syria even possessed chemical weapons.

Mr. Obama's decision to work through the Security Council is itself a shift, given that 10 days ago he described it as ""completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable."" But administration officials said they were swayed by the level of detail in the Russian proposal, which grew out of an impromptu conversation between Mr. Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin on the sidelines of a summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, last week.

""The Lavrov statement was quite comprehensive,"" a senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Frankly, it exceeded expectations in the level of detail it went into.""

On Capitol Hill, where opposition to a strike was hardening, senators emerged from lunchtime meetings with Mr. Obama optimistic that Congress could shift from a resolution authorizing force to one that would give diplomacy more time.

The president impressed on them the need to keep the pressure on Syria and Russia, but expressed support for a delay in any vote until the Security Council makes clear what it plans to do.

""I didn't see any anxiety on the part of the president for an immediate need for action,"" said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland.

While the House was considered the major obstacle for Mr. Obama in seeking approval for a strike, a shift in the Senate began taking shape before the Russian proposal Monday, when it became clear that the straightforward resolution authorizing force that the president had sought was highly unlikely to pass there either. Only a handful of Republicans were yes votes, and at least 15 Democrats were likely to vote no.

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and one of the strongest supporters of a strike, contacted a fellow Republican hawk, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, on Saturday to try to put together a new negotiating group.

On Monday, Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham met in the Capitol and brought in two senior Democratic senators, Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Charles E. Schumer of New York.

Mr. Levin stressed Tuesday that the alternative resolution developed by the group would authorize a military strike, but set aside that authority if Mr. Assad placed his chemical weapons under the control of the United Nations, as Russia has proposed.

""This is kind of a twofer,"" Mr. Levin said. ""It's a way of keeping the pressure on Syria and on Russia to get rid of chemical weapons, which is the goal of the whole effort, and second, if they fail, it would keep the authorization to launch a strike.""

The approach quickly gained supporters in both parties. It meshed with an alternative resolution drafted by two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, which would have given Mr. Assad 45 days to join and comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention or face ""all elements of national power.""

Mr. Graham cautioned that no one should conclude that the latest negotiations would produce a resolution strong enough to maintain a credible threat but capable of passing Congress. ""I'm not going to embrace a U.N. path until I see it's real,"" he said.

Such wariness may be warranted. Russia quickly opposed a draft United Nations resolution circulated by France because it would authorize force if the weapons transfer fell through. The draft, Mr. Lavrov told France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, was ""unacceptable.""

Russia favors a presidential statement, which is far less binding. It would call on the United Nations secretary general and the organization that oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention to carry out the plan to put Syria's arsenal under international control.

The diplomatic maneuvering brought criticism from some Arab countries. ""This does not stop the bloodshed in Syria,"" said Bahrain's foreign minister, Sheik Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa, after a meeting of gulf states.",2013-09-11,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.882, NEU: 0.114, POS: 0.004})",0.003971011843532324,0.11416150629520416,0.8818674683570862,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.904, NEG: 0.058, POS: 0.038})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.913, POS: 0.068, NEG: 0.019})",0.0376661978662014,0.9042348861694336,0.058098915964365005,0.0678955540060997,0.9129353761672974,0.019169092178344727
62,62,2013-10-02-GovernmentShutdown.txt,"Good morning, everybody.  At midnight last night, for the first time in 17 years, Republicans in Congress chose to shut down the federal government.  Let me be more specific:  One faction, of one party, in one house of Congress, in one branch of government, shut down major parts of the government -- all because they didnât like one law. 

This Republican shutdown did not have to happen.  But I want every American to understand why it did happen.  Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the Affordable Care Act.  Theyâve shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans.  In other words, they demanded ransom just for doing their job. 

And many representatives, including an increasing number of Republicans, have made it clear that had they been allowed by Speaker Boehner to take a simple up or down vote on keeping the government open, with no partisan strings attached, enough votes from both parties would have kept the American peopleâs government open and operating.

We may not know the full impact of this Republican shutdown for some time.  It will depend on how long it lasts.  But we do know a couple of things.  We know that the last time Republicans shut down the government in 1996, it hurt our economy.  And unlike 1996, our economy is still recovering from the worst recession in generations. 

We know that certain services and benefits that Americaâs seniors and veterans and business owners depend on must be put on hold.  Certain offices, along with every national park and monument, must be closed.  And while last night, I signed legislation to make sure our 1.4 million active-duty military are paid through the shutdown, hundreds of thousands of civilian workers -- many still on the job, many forced to stay home -- arenât being paid, even if they have families to support and local businesses that rely on them.  And we know that the longer this shutdown continues, the worse the effects will be.  More families will be hurt.  More businesses will be harmed. 

So, once again, I urge House Republicans to reopen the government, restart the services Americans depend on, and allow the public servants who have been sent home to return to work.  This is only going to happen when Republicans realize they donât get to hold the entire economy hostage over ideological demands.

As Iâve said repeatedly, I am prepared to work with Democrats and Republicans to do the things we need to do to grow the economy and create jobs, and get our fiscal house in order over the long run.  Although I should add this shutdown isnât about deficits, or spending, or budgets.  After all, our deficits are falling at the fastest pace in 50 years.  Weâve cut them in half since I took office.  In fact, many of the demands the Republicans are now making would actually raise our deficits.

No, this shutdown is not about deficits, itâs not about budgets.  This shutdown is about rolling back our efforts to provide health insurance to folks who donât have it.  Itâs all about rolling back the Affordable Care Act.  This, more than anything else, seems to be what the Republican Party stands for these days.  I know itâs strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda, but that apparently is what it is. 

And of course, whatâs stranger still is that shutting down our government doesnât accomplish their stated goal.  The Affordable Care Act is a law that passed the House; it passed the Senate.  The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional.  It was a central issue in last yearâs election.  It is settled, and it is here to stay.  And because of its funding sources, itâs not impacted by a government shutdown. 

And these Americans are here with me today because, even though the government is closed, a big part of the Affordable Care Act is now open for business.  And for them, and millions like them, this is a historic day for a good reason.  Itâs been a long time coming, but today, Americans who have been forced to go without insurance can now visit healthcare.gov and enroll in affordable new plans that offer quality coverage.  That starts today. 

And people will have six months to sign up.  So over the next six months, people are going to have the opportunity -- in many cases, for the first time in their lives -- to get affordable coverage that they desperately need.

Now, of course, if youâre one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, you donât need to do a thing. Youâre already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law.  But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance, this opportunity is life-changing. 

Let me just tell folks a few stories that are represented here today.  A few years ago, Amanda Barrett left her job in New York to take care of her parents.  And for a while, she had temporary insurance that covered her multiple sclerosis.  But when it expired, many insurers wouldnât cover her because of her MS.  And she ended up paying $1,200 a month.  Thatâs nowhere near affordable.  So starting today, she can get covered for much less, because todayâs new plan canât use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else.

Sky-high premiums once forced Nancy Beigel to choose between paying her rent or paying for health insurance.  Sheâs been uninsured ever since.  So she pays all of her medical bills out of pocket, puts some on her credit card, making them even harder to pay.  Nancy says, âThey talk about those who fall through the cracks.  I fell through the cracks 10 years ago and Iâve been stuck there ever since.â  Well, starting today, Nancy can get covered just like everybody else.

Trinace Edwards was laid off from her job a year ago today. Six months ago, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor.  She couldnât afford insurance on the individual market, so she hasnât received treatment yet.  Her daughter Lenace, a student at the University of Maryland, is considering dropping out of school to help pay her momâs bills.  Well, starting today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Trinace can get covered without forcing her daughter to give up on her dreams.

So if these stories of hardworking Americans sound familiar to you, well, starting today, you and your friends and your family and your coworkers can get covered, too.  Just visit healthcare.gov, and there you can compare insurance plans, side by side, the same way youâd shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon.  You enter some basic information, youâll be presented with a list of quality, affordable plans that are available in your area, with clear descriptions of what each plan covers, and what it will cost.  Youâll find more choices, more competition, and in many cases, lower prices -- most uninsured Americans will find that they can get covered for $100 or less. 

And you don't have to take my word for it.  Go on the website, healthcare.gov, check it out for yourself.  And then show it to your family and your friends and help them get covered, just like mayors and churches and community groups and companies are already fanning out to do across the country.

And thereâs a hotline where you can apply over the phone and get help with the application, or just get questions that you have answered by real people, in 150 different languages.   So let me give you that number.  The number is 1-800-318-2596 -- 1-800-318-2596.  Check out healthcare.gov.  Call that number.  Show your family and friends how to use it.  And we can get America covered, once and for all, so that the struggles that these folks have gone through and millions around the country have gone through for years finally get addressed.

And let me just remind people why I think this is so important.  I heard a striking statistic yesterday -- if you get cancer, you are 70 percent more likely to live another five years if you have insurance than if you donât.  Think about that.  That is what it means to have health insurance. 

Set aside the issues of security and finances and how youâre impacted by that, the stress involved in not knowing whether or not youâre going to have health care.  This is life-or-death stuff.  Tens of thousands of Americans die each year just because they donât have health insurance.  Millions more live with the fear that theyâll go broke if they get sick.  And today, we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear. 

Already, millions of young adults have been able to stay on their parentsâ plans until they turn 26.  Millions of seniors already have gotten a discount on their prescription medicines.  Already millions of families have actually received rebates from insurance companies that didnât spend enough on their health care.  So this law means more choice, more competition, lower costs for millions of Americans.

And this law doesnât just mean economic security for our families.  It means weâre finally addressing the biggest drivers of our long-term deficits.  It means a stronger economy. 

Remember most Republicans have made a whole bunch of predictions about this law that havenât come true.  There are no âdeath panels.â  Costs havenât skyrocketed; theyâre growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.  The last three years since I signed the Affordable Care Act into law are the three slowest rates of health spending growth on record.
 
And contrary to Republican claims, this law hasnât âdestroyedâ our economy.  Over the past three and a half years, our businesses have created 7.5 million new jobs.  Just today, we learned that our manufacturers are growing at the fastest rate in two and a half years.  They have factored in the Affordable Care Act. They don't think itâs a problem.  Whatâs weighing on the economy is not the Affordable Care Act, but the constant series of crises and the unwillingness to pass a reasonable budget by a faction of the Republican Party.

Now, like every new law, every new product rollout, there are going to be some glitches in the signup process along the way that we will fix.  Iâve been saying this from the start.  For example, we found out that there have been times this morning where the site has been running more slowly than it normally will.  The reason is because more than one million people visited healthcare.gov before 7:00 in the morning. 

To put that in context, there were five times more users in the marketplace this morning than have ever been on Medicare.gov at one time.  That gives you a sense of how important this is to millions of Americans around the country, and thatâs a good thing.  And we're going to be speeding things up in the next few hours to handle all this demand that exceeds anything that we had expected. 

Consider that just a couple of weeks ago, Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system.  And within days, they found a glitch, so they fixed it.  I donât remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads -- or threatening to shut down the company if they didnât.  Thatâs not how we do things in America.  We donât actively root for failure.  We get to work, we make things happen, we make them better, we keep going.

So in that context, I'll work with anybody whoâs got a serious idea to make the Affordable Care Act work better.  I've said that repeatedly.  But as long as I am President, I will not give in to reckless demands by some in the Republican Party to deny affordable health insurance to millions of hardworking Americans. 

I want Republicans in Congress to know these are the Americans youâd hurt if you were allowed to dismantle this law.  Americans like Amanda, Nancy, and Trinace, who now finally have the opportunity for basic security and peace of mind of health care just like everybody else -- including members of Congress.  The notion that youâd make a condition for reopening the government that I make sure these folks donât have health care -- that doesnât make any sense.  It doesnât make any sense. 

Now, let me make one closing point:  This Republican shutdown threatens our economy at a time when millions of Americans are still looking for work, and businesses are starting to get some traction.  So the timing is not good.  Of course, a lot of the Republicans in the House ran for office two years ago promising to shut down the government, and so, apparently, they've now gotten their wish.  But as I've said before, the irony that the House Republicans have to contend with is they've shut down a whole bunch of parts of the government, but the Affordable Care Act is still open for business. 

And this may be why you've got many Republican governors and senators and even a growing number of reasonable Republican congressmen who are telling the extreme right of their party to knock it off, pass a budget, move on. 

And I want to underscore the fact that Congress doesnât just have to end this shutdown and reopen the government -- Congress generally has to stop governing by crisis.  They have to break this habit.  It is a drag on the economy.  It is not worthy of this country. 

For example, one of the most important things Congress has to do in the next couple weeks is to raise what's called the debt ceiling.  And it's important to understand what this is.  This is a routine vote.  Congress has taken this vote 45 times to raise the debt ceiling since Ronald Reagan took office.  It does not cost taxpayers a single dime.  It does not grow our deficits by a single dime.  It does not authorize anybody to spend any new money whatsoever.  All it does is authorize the Treasury to pay the bills on what Congress has already spent. 

Think about that.  If you buy a car and youâve got a car note, you do not save money by not paying your car note.  Youâre just a deadbeat.  If you buy a house, you donât save money by not authorizing yourself to pay the mortgage.  Youâre just going to be foreclosed on your home.  Thatâs what this is about. 

It is routine.  It is what theyâre supposed to do.  This is not a concession to me.  It is not some demand thatâs unreasonable that Iâm making.  This is what Congress is supposed to do as a routine matter.  And they shouldnât wait until the last minute to do it.  The last time Republicans even threatened this course of action -- many of you remember, back in 2011 -- our economy staggered, our credit rating was downgraded for the first time.  If they go through with it this time and force the United States to default on its obligations for the first time in history, it would be far more dangerous than a government shutdown -- as bad as a shutdown is.  It would be an economic shutdown. 

So Iâll speak more on this in the coming days, but let me repeat:  I will not negotiate over Congressâs responsibility to pay bills itâs already racked up.  Iâm not going to allow anybody to drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud just to refight a settled election or extract ideological demands.  Nobody gets to hurt our economy and millions of hardworking families over a law you donât like. 

There are a whole bunch of things that Iâd like to see passed through Congress that the House Republicans havenât passed yet, and Iâm not out there saying, well, Iâm not -- Iâm going to let America default unless Congress does something that they donât want to do.  Thatâs not how adults operate.  Certainly thatâs not how our government should operate.  And thatâs true whether thereâs a Democrat in this office or a Republican in this office.  Doesnât matter whether itâs a Democratic House of Representatives or a Republican-controlled House of Representatives -- there are certain rules that everybody abides by because we donât want to hurt other people just because we have a political disagreement.

So my basic message to Congress is this:  Pass a budget.  End the government shutdown.  Pay your bills.  Prevent an economic shutdown.  Donât wait.  Donât delay.  Donât put our economy or our people through this any longer. 

I am more than happy to work with them on all kinds of issues.  I want to get back to work on the things that the American people sent us here to work on -- creating new jobs, new growth, new security for our middle class. 

Weâre better than this.  Certainly the American people are a lot better than this.  And I believe that what weâve accomplished for Amanda, and Nancy, and Trinace, and tens of millions of their fellow citizens- on this day proves that even when the odds are long and the obstacles are many, we are and always will be a country that can do great things together.

Thank you very much, everybody.  God bless you.  Thank you, all of you, for the great work that youâre doing.  And thank you, Kathleen Sebelius, for the outstanding work that sheâs doing making sure that millions of Americans can get health insurance.

Thank you.
","Lawmakers and the White House dug in Tuesday for a long fight as the first federal government shutdown in nearly two decades showed no signs of breaking, increasing the likelihood it will become entangled in an even larger battle over the Treasury's ability to pay the government's bills.

The two parties held no negotiations to resolve the impasse, instead trading blame. Republicans criticized Senate Democrats as being unwilling to negotiate an end to the standoff that forced federal agencies to curtail a range of activities and begin the furlough of more than 800,000 workers.

U.S. stocks rose despite the government shutdown as investors said it would take a prolonged halt to rattle Wall Street.

President Barack Obama pointed the finger at House Republicans for their efforts to scale back or dismantle the 2010 health law, the Affordable Care Act. ""They've shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans,"" Mr. Obama said from the White House Rose Garden.

House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) pinned the blame on his adversaries, saying, ""Senate Democrats today slammed the door on reopening the federal government by refusing to talk.""

House Republicans launched a new strategy aimed at increasing pressure on Senate Democrats to negotiate with them, only to see it fail in their own chamber Tuesday night. GOP leaders brought forward a series of short-term bills to finance small parts of the government, including veterans services and national parks, through Dec. 15.

None of the bills garnered the two-thirds support needed under an expedited process chosen to highlight House Democrats' unwillingness to fund the popular programs under the Republican plan. GOP lawmakers said they might bring up the bills again later this week in a fashion that would make them easier to pass with just the Republican majority.

The lack of negotiations between the two parties and the White House raises the possibility that the partisan divisions that have brought the government to a standstill could impede the ability of the Treasury to pay the government's bills beyond mid-October. Congress has to approve an increase in the federal debt ceiling by then, and failure to do so could bring broader and more troublesome consequences for the U.S. and global economies than the partial government shutdown.

""The sad news is that, given the performance to date, that the debt limit extension is coming up in two weeks, and this does not portend responsible action on the debt limit,"" said House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D., Md.).

Added Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.): ""Every day we are here, the calendars are running together.""

The shutdown was sparked because Republicans were determined to scale back the Affordable Care Act before the insurance marketplaces opened. The GOP-led House refused to fund federal agencies for the new fiscal year, which began Tuesday, without attaching provisions to delay the health law or otherwise curb its reach. The Democratic-controlled Senate rejected each of those efforts.

The Senate also rejected on Tuesday a House measure, approved in the early hours of Tuesday morning, that the two chambers assign a small group of lawmakers to resolve the budget differences. That measure also included curbs on the health law, including a one-year delay in its requirement that individuals carry health insurance.

The idea of passing a series of narrowly tailored spending bills was floated by Mr. Boehner at a closed-door strategy session with rank-and-file lawmakers. Republicans said it showed their interest in trying to blunt the effects of the shutdown.

""It's going to get the aspects of government open that I think most people are concerned about and, along the way, it'll signify to the American people that we're serious about keeping the government open,"" said Rep. Matt Salmon (R., Ariz.).

But Senate Democrats rejected the strategy, saying their goal was to reopen the entire government. ""People shouldn't have to choose between help for our veterans and cancer research,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) called it ""another wacky idea"" from the GOP, and said: ""If they think they're going to come and nitpick us on this, it won't work.""

The idea echoed a proposal floated in the past week by Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) to pass individual spending bills in an effort put pressure on the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Some centrist Republicans showed fresh anxiety about the GOP strategy of allowing the government to shut down rather than abandoning the party's demands for Democrats to agree to changes to the health-care law.

Rep. Scott Rigell (R., Va.) said he now wanted GOP leaders to end the spending standoff and pass a bill shorn of health-care riders.

He said he worried about the ""economic pain"" from the shutdown and concluded that ""the wiser path was to recognize that the time had come to fund the government fully.""

Other Republicans -- including Mr. Boehner himself, in the past -- have favored waging their fight for major changes in the health-care law not as part of the short-term extension of government spending but on the coming debt-limit fight.

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) on Tuesday cited the debt-limit bill as the most likely vehicle for negotiations over broad debt-reduction initiatives. ""That's what we think will be the forcing mechanism"" to craft a deficit-reduction measure later this year, he said at a news event called to focus on the government-funding standoff.

The White House and Senate Democrats have refused to negotiate conditions for Congress passing the debt limit, saying Congress had a responsibility to allow the Treasury to pay bills that lawmakers had already incurred. ""This is not a concession to me,"" Mr. Obama said Tuesday. ""It is not some demand that's unreasonable that I'm making. This is what Congress is supposed to do as a routine matter.""

However, White House officials signaled that Mr. Obama would negotiate with Republicans on their broader budget concerns and possibly some tweaks to the health care law if Congress approved a temporary extension of government funding and debt-limit increase to give officials time for talks. Details of how such an agreement would work were unclear.

One official said the White House would like, in particular, to address broad budget cuts known as the sequester, but also said there are some tax issues on which Mr. Obama and Republicans could reach a compromise.","President Obama admonished House Republicans on Tuesday to quit fighting his three-year-old health care law and to ""reopen the government,"" a show of defiance that reflected Democrats' confidence that conservatives have overreached after years of budget battles with the White House.

""As long as I am president, I will not give in to reckless demands by some in the Republican Party to deny affordable health insurance to millions of hard-working Americans,"" Mr. Obama said from the Rose Garden, flanked by new beneficiaries of the insurance program.

Then, gesturing toward his guests, he added, ""I want Republicans in Congress to know -- these are the Americans you'd hurt if you were allowed to dismantle this law.""

The president's televised appearance captured the split-screen nature of this first of October: It was the start of a new fiscal year, with the federal government largely shuttered because of the parties' funding impasse, yet also the inaugural day for a central piece of the landmark health care law at the center of the budget standoff.

On Tuesday, uninsured Americans, about 15 percent of the population, could begin enrolling in the state-based insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, created by the 2010 law.

It was unclear how long the shutdown might go on, and no one in either party could say if Republicans would remain firm in their insistence that Democrats agree to significant changes to the health care law. But on the initial day of the first shutdown in nearly 18 years -- when a Republican-controlled Congress battled another Democratic president, Bill Clinton -- there was little business getting done in the House or the Senate other than photo opportunities and partisan speeches.

One senior Republican, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman, indicated that the stalemate could go on for at least two more weeks until the nation reaches its borrowing limit. He said the deadline to address the debt limit, and avoid a default, could be ""the forcing mechanism to bring the two parties together.""

Yet House Republicans also vow to oppose an increase in the debt ceiling unless Mr. Obama delays the health care law.

On Tuesday night, Speaker John A. Boehner and House Republicans tried to ease the effects of the shutdown and force Democrats into negotiation. The Republicans proposed three bills -- to finance veterans' programs, the National Park Service and federally run services in Washington -- but because they introduced the measures under a fast-track procedural rule that required a two-thirds vote, each of them failed.

Republicans are considering bringing up the bills again on Wednesday under a different rule that would require only a simple majority, but they have no chance of moving forward. ""By refusing to let the House vote on the only bill that will reopen the government, Speaker Boehner is single-handedly keeping the government shut down,"" said Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader.

Earlier, the District of Columbia Council approved a measure to keep city government functioning and pay its employees from a contingency fund that would last for about two weeks.

The mood in the White House was upbeat and enthusiastic, aides said, buoyed by a sense that Republicans were on the defensive -- in the news media, in their states and among others in their party.

In past budget conflicts back to 2010, administration officials have said that media commentary amounted to ""a pox on both your houses,"" with reporters and pundits suggesting that both parties were equally to blame when, in the White House's view, Republicans have been the obstructionists since they took control of the House in the 2010 elections.

On Capitol Hill, an uneasy calm descended after the 12:01 a.m. shutdown. By the morning light the usual hordes of tourists were barred from entering the Capitol and many House and Senate aides stayed home, furloughed without pay. Republicans acknowledged that they were in the weaker position politically but argued that Democrats could not long defend their refusal to negotiate.

""At every turn, the answer has been no,"" said Senator John Thune, a Republican leader from South Dakota. ""I don't think the American people see that as a reasonable proposition.""

Democrats, with some support in early national polls, said they could hold firm so long as Republicans' demands were so unreasonable -- and, in their view, disingenuous.

Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, noted that House and Senate Democrats had been pressing for a conference committee to negotiate a budget for the 2014 fiscal year since March but had been ""blocked by Republicans 18 times in the last six months.""

Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democratic leader from New York, said, ""At the rate it's going,"" Republicans ""will have to open up the government sooner rather than later because they won't be able to sustain their position.""

Not all Republicans were backing their leaders' pleas to stand strong against the president. Representative Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican, became the latest moderate to break ranks, saying his party should abandon the fight to target the health law as a condition of approving a budget. ""Republicans fought the good fight,"" he said.

Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said of Democrats: ""We've called their bluff, and they didn't blink. At this point it would kind of strain logic to assume that going deeper into this when Republicans are likely to get the blame will benefit us more.""

Nonetheless, at noon, House Republican leaders summoned reporters and photographers into a gilded room overlooking the National Mall, directing the cameras to capture the empty seats -- for Democrats, they said -- at the table.

""The way to resolve our differences is to sit down and talk,"" said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican. ""And as you can see here, there's no one here on the other side of the table.""

The scene so irritated Mr. Reid that he soon strode onto the Senate floor to denounce such ""silly, empty Republican stunts.""

His Republican counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, also took to the floor. ""Well, Democrat leaders in Congress finally have their prize -- a government shutdown that no one seems to want but them,"" he said.

Mr. Reid, a former boxer, interrupted with a jab. ""My friend the Republican leader spoke as if George Orwell wrote his speech,"" he said. ""This is '1984,' where up is down, down is up, east is west."" Nobody was happier to have the government closed than the Tea Party, Mr. Reid said, adding, ""We had a good day for the anarchists.""

From the White House, the president had the loudest megaphone and a battery of television cameras to likewise make the case that the Republican Party in Congress had been taken over by a minority of militantly conservative lawmakers who have cowed Republican leaders.

""At midnight last night for the first time in 17 years, the Republicans in Congress chose to shut down the federal government,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Let me be more specific: One faction of one party in one house of Congress in one branch of government shut down major parts of the government, all because they did not like one law.""

Mr. Obama said once again that he would not negotiate over the debt ceiling and ""allow anybody to drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud just to refight a settled election or extract ideological demands."" He added: ""I'm not out there saying, 'Well, I'm going to let America default unless Congress does something that they don't want to do.' That's not how adults operate.""

Mr. Obama said the full economic impact would depend on how long the shutdown goes on -- something neither party was willing to predict. But, he said: ""We know that the last time Republicans shut down the government in 1996, it hurt our economy. And unlike 1996, our economy is still recovering from the worst recession in generations.""",2013-10-02,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.937, NEU: 0.059, POS: 0.004})",0.003941184375435114,0.05879352241754532,0.9372653365135193,"AnalyzerOutput(output=NEG, probas={NEG: 0.538, NEU: 0.448, POS: 0.014})","AnalyzerOutput(output=NEU, probas={NEU: 0.526, POS: 0.456, NEG: 0.017})",0.014446312561631203,0.447648823261261,0.5379047989845276,0.4563083052635193,0.5262548923492432,0.017436888068914413
63,63,2013-12-06-NelsonMandelaObit.txt," At his trial in 1964, Nelson Mandela closed his statement from the dock saying, âI have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.  I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.  It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.  But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.â

And Nelson Mandela lived for that ideal, and he made it real.  He achieved more than could be expected of any man.  Today, he has gone home.  And we have lost one of the most influential, courageous, and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this Earth.  He no longer belongs to us -- he belongs to the ages.

Through his fierce dignity and unbending will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa -- and moved all of us.  His journey from a prisoner to a President embodied the promise that human beings -- and countries -- can change for the better.  His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to, whether in the lives of nations or our own personal lives.  And the fact that he did it all with grace and good humor, and an ability to acknowledge his own imperfections, only makes the man that much more remarkable.  As he once said, âI am not a saint, unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.â

I am one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela's life.  My very first political action, the first thing I ever did that involved an issue or a policy or politics, was a protest against apartheid.  I studied his words and his writings.  The day that he was released from prison gave me a sense of what human beings can do when theyâre guided by their hopes and not by their fears.  And like so many around the globe, I cannot fully imagine my own life without the example that Nelson Mandela set, and so long as I live I will do what I can to learn from him.

To GraÃ§a Machel and his family, Michelle and I extend our deepest sympathy and gratitude for sharing this extraordinary man with us.  His lifeâs work meant long days away from those who loved him the most.  And I only hope that the time spent with him these last few weeks brought peace and comfort to his family.

To the people of South Africa, we draw strength from the example of renewal, and reconciliation, and resilience that you made real.  A free South Africa at peace with itself -- thatâs an example to the world, and thatâs Madibaâs legacy to the nation he loved.

We will not likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again.  So it falls to us as best we can to forward the example that he set:  to make decisions guided not by hate, but by love; to never discount the difference that one person can make; to strive for a future that is worthy of his sacrifice. 

For now, let us pause and give thanks for the fact that Nelson Mandela lived -- a man who took history in his hands, and bent the arc of the moral universe toward justice.  May God Bless his memory and keep him in peace.
","Nelson Mandela, who rose from militant antiapartheid activist to become the unifying president of a democratic South Africa and a global symbol of racial reconciliation, died at his Johannesburg home following a lengthy stay at a Pretoria hospital, the government said Thursday. He was 95.

In a state television address, President Jacob Zuma said Mr. Mandela had died that evening after a long illness. ""Our nation has lost its greatest son. Our people have lost a father,"" said Mr. Zuma, dressed in a dark jacket and reading his statement in deep somber tones. ""Although we knew that this day would come, nothing can diminish our sense of a profound and enduring loss.""

In a somber statement from the White House, President Barack Obama said Mr. Mandela ""achieved more than could be expected of any man. Today he's gone home and we've lost one of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this Earth.""

He also expressed his condolences in a phone conversation with Mr. Zuma.

As Mr. Zuma addressed the nation, passersby stopped outside Mr. Mandela's home in Johannesburg, crying and carrying flowers and lighting candles. South Africa's state television broadcaster played ""Amazing Grace,"" as it scrolled through pictures of Mr. Mandela's life and his struggle against apartheid.

Mr. Mandela spent nearly three months in the hospital through September, initially to treat a lung infection. It was the latest in a series of increasingly severe ailments South Africa's first black president had battled since contracting tuberculosis during his nearly three decades in prison for opposing the former white-minority regime.

Though Mr. Mandela had stepped down from the presidency in 1999, he remained a father figure for a country going through wrenching economic and political change. South Africa's economy has struggled to grow about 2% this year, well below government targets of 7%, and unemployment among young people is close to 80%. In recent years, protests in predominantly black townships have erupted over poor public services and a dearth of job opportunities. Many black South Africans, born after the dawn of democracy in 1994, are channeling their frustration toward the current government, led by Mr. Mandela's African National Congress.

It was as a prisoner that Mr. Mandela first became a rallying point for opponents of apartheid. After he was sentenced to life in prison in 1964, he spent more than 25 years behind bars, much of it in a maximum-security prison on Robben Island, off the coast of Cape Town.

By the time he was released from a different prison in 1990, the tables had been turned. South Africa had become a pariah nation, and Mr. Mandela would lead his country's re-embrace of a world that had spurned its racist government.

With South African President F.W. de Klerk, with whom he had met secretly with other apartheid officials in prison, Mr. Mandela would pick apart the machinery of white political domination through painstaking negotiations. Those negotiations laid the groundwork for the election in 1994 of the country's first black president -- Mr. Mandela.

Mr. Mandela inherited a fractured nation. He led it back from the brink of civil war, forming a government of national unity that demolished apartheid and established a constitution that is one of the most liberal in the world in terms of human rights.

Mr. Mandela's tall task was, as he put it, to find the ""middle ground between white fears and black hopes."" But he also needed to reconcile disparate factions within his party, the African National Congress. Some influential ANC leaders wanted to take a tougher line against whites after triumphing at the ballot box, and some argued for a wealth tax to speed the redistribution of the country's resources, said Verne Harris, a historian at the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, which houses the archives of the former president.

""There were many who argued the case for tough love -- don't make it easy for them,"" said Mr. Harris. ""Reconciliation was a beautiful fit for South Africa, but we forget that it wasn't the only approach being discussed at the time.""

During his six decades in the public arena, Mr. Mandela wasn't above precipitous shifts in position. He initially put his faith in Gandhian nonviolence, but when strikes and protests began to seem futile, he founded a band of saboteurs. He believed in obedience to the party but acted unilaterally at turning points in the struggle.

Even occasional critics would come to see Mr. Mandela as the political glue that held his party, and later the country, together.

Mr. de Klerk, who would serve as Mr. Mandela's deputy after the country's first democratic vote, said his former adversary ""could be brutal"" in negotiations. But the pair, who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize for the country's democratic transition, was able to sell compromises to supporters who differed radically in outlook.

Rolihlahla Mandela -- ""Nelson"" was added when he started school -- was born July 18, 1918, to a chief of the Thembu tribe of the Xhosa people in South Africa. He grew up in a village of mud huts and grass rooftops, the floors made of earth smeared with cow dung, in the land known as the Transkei. Women farmed corn, or mealies, pumpkins and beans; men left their families to work on white-owned farms or mines. Blacks at the time had few rights in the new country, founded by white European immigrants known as Afrikaners.

Mr. Mandela was the first in his family to attend school and eventually began working toward a law degree in Johannesburg. He hoped for a civil-service job in the Native Affairs Department in the government, about as high as a black man could aspire at the time.

His struggle for civil rights involved ""a steady accumulation of one thousand slights, one thousand indignities, one thousand unremembered moments, [that] produced in me an anger, a rebelliousness, a desire to fight the system that impoverished my people,"" he wrote in his autobiography.

He joined the African National Congress and helped found its Youth League. The ANC became the center of resistance to apartheid, the South African system of racial segregation, introduced after the National Party came to power in 1948.

Years of confrontations with authorities, including the Sharpeville massacre of 1960 in which 69 protesters were killed by police, persuaded Mr. Mandela to abandon his commitment to Gandhian nonviolence. He organized a sabotage unit and went underground.

Mr. Mandela was arrested in 1962 and put on trial for inciting strikes. Rather than defend himself against the charges, he indicted the apartheid state in a four-hour speech that became one of the founding texts of a postapartheid state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.

Months later, he was charged with sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government, a capital crime, after a police raid on a Johannesburg farmhouse turned up plans for guerrilla warfare. This time he was sentenced to life in prison, along with seven other ANC members.

At the opening of what became known as the Rivonia trial, Mr. Mandela delivered another long speech that ended with his vision for a new South Africa, and what he was willing to sacrifice for it.

Mr. Mandela, then 46 years old, spent the next 18 years on Robben Island, a former leper colony turned maximum-security prison.

He entered Robben Island a militant who had failed to topple a government, but came out as a leader who succeeded in building a new nation on a platform of peace and reconciliation among races. Mr. Mandela would later credit prison for uniting the country's future leaders, giving them time to talk through differences and forging a collective will to persevere. In an early sign of how he would reach across the political and racial divide, Mr. Mandela taught himself Afrikaans and used the language to charm his guards -- and elicit more sympathetic treatment.

Outside, the struggle in South Africa had grown increasingly violent. ANC and other antiapartheid fighters were arrested, detained and tortured. Mr. Mandela became the face who transcended fragmented freedom movements.

Mr. Mandela's greatest contribution was his decision to begin negotiations with the apartheid state while he was still in detention. The apartheid government, increasingly isolated internationally, was looking for a way out. South Africa kept negotiations secret, and Mr. Mandela didn't inform his ANC comrades.

""There are times when a leader must move out ahead of the flock, go off in a new direction, confident he is leading his people the right way,"" he wrote in his memoir.

Five years of private meetings followed, with Mr. Mandela sitting down with various officials, and ultimately the president, Mr. de Klerk. In his opening speech to Parliament in 1990, Mr. de Klerk scrapped a ban on opposition parties and announced the release of political prisoners, including Mr. Mandela. ""The season of violence is over,"" Mr. de Klerk said at the time. ""The time for reconstruction and reconciliation has arrived.""

Mr. Mandela was released on Feb. 11, 1990. He emerged from the prison gates and raised his fist to a roar from the crowds who had gathered to greet him.

Many whites supported Mr. Mandela and had joined protests for his release. But there remained unresolved anger from blacks over the apartheid state.

After a four-year transitional government, elections were held on April 27, 1994, open for the first time in South Africa's history to all men and women of voting age. Mr. Mandela was elected president.

By ending white minority rule peacefully, through compromises with Mr. de Klerk, Mr. Mandela set a new standard for resolving conflicts far beyond South Africa. He showed how nations divided by ethnic, racial and religious violence and hate may begin to come together, even if that process at home has been more painful and taken longer than most people had hoped.

Unlike many African leaders hailed as heroes and freedom fighters, Mr. Mandela stepped down from office after only one term. He established three foundations in his name, dedicated to tolerance and preserving the history of the antiapartheid fight. He married his third wife, Graca Machel, on his 80th birthday, and settled into a spacious home in a suburb of Johannesburg.

In the final years of his life, Mr. Mandela largely retreated from public view, spending time with his children and grandchildren in the rural village of Qunu in the Eastern Cape, not far from where he was born.

Mr. Mandela's hospital visits sparked panic in government and the media. The anxiety underscored how hungry the public remained for information about the former political prisoner who became the country's first black president, a transition that changed how the world viewed South Africa and how South Africans viewed themselves.","Nelson Mandela, who led the emancipation of South Africa from white minority rule and served as his country's first black president, becoming an international emblem of dignity and forbearance, died Thursday night. He was 95.

The South African president, Jacob Zuma, announced Mr. Mandela's death.

Mr. Mandela had long said he wanted a quiet exit, but the time he spent in a Pretoria hospital this summer was a clamor of quarreling family, hungry news media, spotlight-seeking politicians and a national outpouring of affection and loss. The vigil eclipsed a visit by President Obama, who paid homage to Mr. Mandela but decided not to intrude on the privacy of a dying man he considered his hero.

Mr. Mandela ultimately died at home at 8:50 p.m. local time, and he will be buried according to his wishes in the village of Qunu, where he grew up. The exhumed remains of three of his children were reinterred there in early July under a court order, resolving a family squabble that had played out in the news media.

Mr. Mandela's quest for freedom took him from the court of tribal royalty to the liberation underground to a prison rock quarry to the presidential suite of Africa's richest country. And then, when his first term of office was up, unlike so many of the successful revolutionaries he regarded as kindred spirits, he declined a second term and cheerfully handed over power to an elected successor, the country still gnawed by crime, poverty, corruption and disease but a democracy, respected in the world and remarkably at peace.

The question most often asked about Mr. Mandela was how, after whites had systematically humiliated his people, tortured and murdered many of his friends, and cast him into prison for 27 years, he could be so evidently free of spite.

The government he formed when he finally won the chance was an improbable fusion of races and beliefs, including many of his former oppressors. When he became president, he invited one of his white wardens to the inauguration. Mr. Mandela overcame a personal mistrust bordering on loathing to share both power and a Nobel Peace Prize with the white president who preceded him, F. W. de Klerk.

And as president, from 1994 to 1999, he devoted much energy to moderating the bitterness of his black electorate and to reassuring whites with fears of vengeance.

The explanation for his absence of rancor, at least in part, is that Mr. Mandela was that rarity among revolutionaries and moral dissidents: a capable statesman, comfortable with compromise and impatient with the doctrinaire.

When the question was put to Mr. Mandela in an interview for this obituary in 2007 -- after such barbarous torment, how do you keep hatred in check? -- his answer was almost dismissive: Hating clouds the mind. It gets in the way of strategy. Leaders cannot afford to hate.

Except for a youthful flirtation with black nationalism, he seemed to have genuinely transcended the racial passions that tore at his country. Some who worked with him said this apparent magnanimity came easily to him because he always regarded himself as superior to his persecutors.

In his five years as president, Mr. Mandela, though still a sainted figure abroad, lost some luster at home as he strained to hold together a divided populace and to turn a fractious liberation movement into a credible government.

Some blacks -- including Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Mr. Mandela's former wife, who cultivated a following among the most disaffected blacks -- complained that he had moved too slowly to narrow the vast gulf between the impoverished black majority and the more prosperous white minority. Some whites said he had failed to control crime, corruption and cronyism. Some blacks deserted government to make money; some whites emigrated, taking capital and knowledge with them.

Undoubtedly Mr. Mandela had become less attentive to the details of governing, turning over the daily responsibilities to the deputy who would succeed him in 1999, Thabo Mbeki.

But few among his countrymen doubted that without his patriarchal authority and political shrewdness, South Africa might well have descended into civil war long before it reached its imperfect state of democracy.

After leaving the presidency, Mr. Mandela brought that moral stature to bear elsewhere around the continent, as a peace broker and champion of greater outside investment.

Rise of a 'Troublemaker'

Mr. Mandela was deep into a life prison term when he caught the notice of the world as a symbol of the opposition to apartheid, literally ""apartness"" in the Afrikaans language, a system of racial gerrymandering that stripped blacks of their citizenship and relegated them to reservation-style ""homelands"" and townships.

Around 1980, exiled leaders of the foremost anti-apartheid movement, the African National Congress, decided that this eloquent lawyer was the perfect hero to humanize their campaign against the system that denied 80 percent of South Africans any voice in their own affairs. ""Free Nelson Mandela,"" already a liberation chant within South Africa, became a pop-chart anthem in Britain, and Mr. Mandela's face bloomed on placards at student rallies in America aimed at mustering trade sanctions against the apartheid regime.

Mr. Mandela noted with some amusement in his 1994 autobiography, ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" that this congregation made him the world's best-known political prisoner without knowing precisely who he was. Probably it was just his impish humor, but he claimed to have been told that when posters went up in London, many young supporters thought Free was his Christian name.

In South Africa, though, and among those who followed the country's affairs more closely, Nelson Mandela was already a name to reckon with.

He was born Rolihlahla Mandela on July 18, 1918, in Mvezo, a tiny village of cows, corn and mud huts in the rolling hills of the Transkei, a former British protectorate in the south. His given name, he enjoyed pointing out, translates colloquially as ""troublemaker."" He received his more familiar English name from a teacher when he began school at age 7. His father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a chief of the Thembu people, a subdivision of the Xhosa nation.

When Nelson was an infant, his father was stripped of his chieftainship by a British magistrate for insubordination, showing a proud stubborn streak his son willingly claimed as an inheritance.

Nine years later, on the death of his father, young Nelson was taken into the home of the paramount chief of the Thembu -- not as an heir to power, but in a position to study it. He would become worldly and westernized, but some of his closest friends would always attribute his regal self-confidence (and his occasional autocratic behavior) to his upbringing in a royal household.

Unlike many black South Africans, whose confidence had been crushed by generations of officially proclaimed white superiority, Mr. Mandela never seemed to doubt that he was the equal of any man. ""The first thing to remember about Mandela is that he came from a royal family,"" said Ahmed Kathrada, an activist who shared a prison cellblock with Mr. Mandela and was part of his inner circle. ""That always gave him a strength.""

In his autobiography, Mr. Mandela recalled eavesdropping on the endless consensus-seeking deliberations of the tribal council and noticing that the chief worked ""like a shepherd.""

""He stays behind the flock,"" he continued, ""letting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind.""

That would often be his own style as leader and president.

Mr. Mandela maintained his close ties to the royal family of the Thembu tribe, a large and influential constituency in the important Transkei region. And his background there gave him useful insights into the sometimes tribal politics of South Africa.

Most important, it helped him manage the lethal divisions within the large Zulu nation, which was rived by a power struggle between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party. While many A.N.C. leaders demonized the Inkatha leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Mr. Mandela embraced him into his new unity government and finally quelled the violence.

Mr. Mandela once explained in an interview that the key to peace in the Zulu nation was simple: Mr. Buthelezi had been raised as a member of the royal Zulu family, but as a nephew, not in the direct line of succession, leaving him tortured by a sense of insecurity about his position. The solution was to love him into acquiescence.

Joining a Movement

The enlarging of Mr. Mandela's outlook began at Methodist missionary schools and the University College of Fort Hare, then the only residential college for blacks in South Africa. Mr. Mandela said later that he had entered the university still thinking of himself as a Xhosa first and foremost, but left with a broader African perspective.

Studying law at Fort Hare, he fell in with Oliver Tambo, another leader-to-be of the liberation movement. The two were suspended for a student protest in 1940 and sent home on the verge of expulsion. Much later, Mr. Mandela called the episode -- his refusal to yield on a minor point of principle -- ""foolhardy.""

On returning to his home village, he learned that his family had chosen a bride for him. Finding the woman unappealing and the prospect of a career in tribal government even more so, he ran away to the black metropolis of Soweto, following other young blacks who had left mostly to work in the gold mines around Johannesburg.

There he was directed to Walter Sisulu, who ran a real estate business and was a spark plug in the African National Congress. Mr. Sisulu looked upon the tall young man with his aristocratic bearing and confident gaze and, he recalled in an interview, decided that his prayers had been answered.

Mr. Mandela soon impressed the activists with his ability to win over doubters. ""His starting point is that 'I am going to persuade this person no matter what,' "" Mr. Sisulu said. ""That is his gift. He will go to anybody, anywhere, with that confidence. Even when he does not have a strong case, he convinces himself that he has.""

Mr. Mandela, though he had not yet completed his law degree, opened the first black law partnership in South Africa with Mr. Tambo. He took up amateur boxing, rising before dawn to run roadwork. Tall and slim, he was also somewhat vain. He wore impeccable suits, displaying an attention to fashion that would much later be evident in the elegantly bright loose shirts of African cloth that became his trademark.

Impatient with the seeming impotence of their elders in the African National Congress, Mr. Mandela, Mr. Tambo, Mr. Sisulu and other militants organized the A.N.C. Youth League, issuing a manifesto so charged with Pan-African nationalism that some of their nonblack sympathizers were offended.

Africanism versus nonracialism: that was the great divide in liberation thinking. The black consciousness movement, whose most famous martyr was Steve Biko, argued that before Africans could take their place in a multiracial state, their confidence and sense of responsibility must be rebuilt.

Mr. Mandela, too, was attracted to this doctrine of self-sufficiency.

""I was angry at the white man, not at racism,"" he wrote in his autobiography. ""While I was not prepared to hurl the white man into the sea, I would have been perfectly happy if he climbed aboard his steamships and left the continent of his own volition.""

In his conviction that blacks should liberate themselves, he joined friends in breaking up Communist Party meetings because he regarded Communism as an alien, non-African ideology, and for a time he insisted that the A.N.C. keep a distance from Indian and mixed-race political movements.

""This was the trend of the youth at that time,"" Mr. Sisulu said. But Mr. Mandela, he said, was never ""an extreme nationalist,"" or much of an ideologue of any stripe. He was a man of action.

He was also, already, a man of audacious self-confidence.

Joe Matthews, who worked for Mr. Mandela in the Youth League (and later became a moderate voice in the rival Inkatha movement), heard Mr. Mandela speak at a black-tie dinner in 1952 and predict, in what the audience took as impudence, that he would be the first president of a free South Africa.

""He was not a theoretician, but he was a doer,"" Mr. Matthews said in an interview for the television documentary program ""Frontline."" ""He was a man who did things, and he was always ready to volunteer to be the first to do any dangerous or difficult thing.""

Five years after forming the Youth League, the young rebels engineered a generational takeover of the African National Congress.

During his years as a young lawyer in Soweto, Mr. Mandela married a nurse, Evelyn Ntoko Mase, and they had four children, including a daughter who died at 9 months. But the demands of his politics kept him from his family. Compounding the strain was his wife's joining the Jehovah's Witnesses, a sect that abjures any participation in politics. The marriage grew cold and ended with abruptness.

""He said, 'Evelyn, I feel that I have no love for you anymore,' "" his first wife said in an interview for a documentary film. "" 'I'll give you the children and the house.' ""

Not long afterward, a friend introduced him to Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela, a stunning and strong-willed medical social worker 16 years his junior. Mr. Mandela was smitten, declaring on their first date that he would marry her. He did so in 1958, while he and other activists were in the midst of a marathon trial on treason charges. His second marriage would be tumultuous, producing two daughters and a national drama of forced separation, devotion, remorse and acrimony.

A Shift to Militancy

In 1961, with the patience of the liberation movement stretched to the snapping point by the police killing of 69 peaceful demonstrators in Sharpeville township the previous year, Mr. Mandela led the African National Congress onto a new road of armed insurrection.

It was an abrupt shift for a man who, not many weeks earlier, had proclaimed nonviolence an inviolable principle of the A.N.C. He later explained that forswearing violence ""was not a moral principle but a strategy; there is no moral goodness in using an ineffective weapon.""

Taking as his text Che Guevara's ""Guerrilla Warfare,"" Mr. Mandela became the first commander of a motley liberation army, grandly named Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation.

Although he denied it throughout his life, there is persuasive evidence that about this time Mr. Mandela briefly joined the South African Communist Party, the A.N.C.'s partner in opening the armed resistance. Mr. Mandela presumably joined for the party's connections to Communist countries that would finance the campaign of violence. Stephen Ellis, a British historian who in 2011 found reference to Mr. Mandela's membership in secret party minutes, said Mr. Mandela ""wasn't a real convert; it was just an opportunist thing.""

Mr. Mandela's exploits in the ""armed struggle"" have been somewhat mythologized. During his months as a cloak-and-dagger outlaw, the press christened him ""the Black Pimpernel."" But while he trained for guerrilla fighting and sought weapons for Spear of the Nation, he saw no combat. The A.N.C.'s armed activities were mostly confined to planting land mines, blowing up electrical stations and committing occasional acts of terrorism against civilians.

After the first free elections in South Africa, Spear of the Nation's reputation was stained by admissions of human rights abuses in its training camps, though no evidence emerged that Mr. Mandela was complicit in them.

During Trial, a Legend Grows

South Africa's rulers were determined to put Mr. Mandela and his comrades out of action. In 1956, he and scores of other dissidents were arrested on charges of treason. The state botched the prosecution, and after the acquittal Mr. Mandela went underground. Upon his capture he was charged with inciting a strike and leaving the country without a passport. His legend grew when, on the first day of that trial, he entered the courtroom wearing a traditional Xhosa leopard-skin cape to underscore that he was an African entering a white man's jurisdiction.

That trial resulted in a three-year sentence, but it was just a warm-up for the main event. Next Mr. Mandela and eight other A.N.C. leaders were charged with sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the state -- capital crimes. It was called the Rivonia trial, for the name of the farm where the defendants had conspired and where a trove of incriminating documents was found -- many in Mr. Mandela's handwriting -- outlining and justifying a violent campaign to bring down the regime.

At Mr. Mandela's suggestion, the defendants, certain of conviction, set out to turn the trial into a moral drama that would vindicate them in the court of world opinion. They admitted that they had organized a liberation army and had engaged in sabotage and tried to lay out a political justification for these acts. Among themselves, they agreed that even if sentenced to hang, they would refuse on principle to appeal.

The four-hour speech with which Mr. Mandela opened the defense's case was one of the most eloquent of his life, and -- in the view of his authorized biographer, Anthony Sampson -- it established him as the leader not only of the A.N.C. but also of the international movement against apartheid.

Mr. Mandela described his personal evolution from the temptations of black nationalism to the politics of multiracialism. He acknowledged that he was the commander of Spear of the Nation, but asserted that he had turned to violence only after nonviolent resistance had been foreclosed. He conceded that he had made alliances with Communists -- a powerful current in the prosecution case in those Cold War days -- but likened this to Churchill's cooperation with Stalin against Hitler.

He finished with a coda of his convictions that would endure as an oratorical highlight of South African history.

""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination,"" he told the court. ""I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal for which I hope to live for and to see realized. But my lord, if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""

Under considerable pressure from liberals at home and abroad, including a nearly unanimous vote of the United Nations General Assembly, to spare the defendants, the judge acquitted one and sentenced Mr. Mandela and the others to life in prison.

An Education in Prison

Mr. Mandela was 44 when he was manacled and put on a ferry to the Robben Island prison. He would be 71 when he was released.

Robben Island, in shark-infested waters about seven miles off Cape Town, had over the centuries been a naval garrison, a mental hospital and a leper colony, but it was most famously a prison. For Mr. Mandela and his co-defendants, it began with a nauseating ferry ride, during which guards amused themselves by urinating down the air vents onto the prisoners below.

The routine on Robben Island was one of isolation, boredom and petty humiliations, met with frequent shows of resistance. By day the men were marched to a limestone quarry, where the fine dust stirred up by their labors glued their tear ducts shut.

But in some ways prison was less arduous than life outside in those unsettled times. For Mr. Mandela and others, Robben Island was a university. In whispered conversations as they hacked at the limestone and in tightly written polemics handed from cellblock to cellblock, the prisoners debated everything from Marxism to circumcision.

Mr. Mandela learned Afrikaans, the language of the dominant whites, and urged other prisoners to do the same.

He honed his skills as a leader, negotiator and proselytizer, and not only the factions among the prisoners but also some of the white administrators found his charm and iron will irresistible. He credited his prison experience with teaching him the tactics and strategy that would make him president.

Almost from his arrival he assumed a kind of command. The first time his lawyer, George Bizos, visited him, Mr. Mandela greeted him and then introduced his eight guards by name -- to their amazement -- as ""my guard of honor."" The prison authorities began treating him as a prison elder statesman.

During his time on the island, a new generation of political inmates arose, defiant veterans of a national student uprising who at first resisted the authority of the elders but gradually came under their tutelage. Years later Mr. Mandela recalled the young hotheads with a measure of exasperation:

""When you say, 'What are you going to do?' they say, 'We will attack and destroy them!' I say: 'All right, have you analyzed how strong they are, the enemy? Have you compared their strength to your strength?' They say, 'No, we will just attack!' ""

Perhaps because Mr. Mandela was so revered, he was singled out for gratuitous cruelties by the authorities. The wardens left newspaper clippings in his cell about how his wife had been cited as the other woman in a divorce case, and about the persecution she and her children endured after being exiled to a bleak town 250 miles from Johannesburg.

He was denied permission to attend the funerals of his mother and his oldest son, who died in a car accident.

Friends say his experiences steeled his self-control and made him, more than ever, a man who buried his emotions deep, who spoke in the collective ""we"" of liberation rhetoric.

Still, Mr. Mandela said he regarded his prison experience as a major factor in his nonracial outlook. He said prison tempered any desire for vengeance by exposing him to sympathetic white guards who smuggled in newspapers and extra rations, and to moderates within the National Party government who approached him in hopes of opening a dialogue. Above all, prison taught him to be a master negotiator.

The Negotiations Begin

Mr. Mandela's decision to begin negotiations with the white government was one of the most momentous of his life, and he made it like an autocrat, without consulting his comrades, knowing full well that they would resist.

""My comrades did not have the advantages that I had of brushing shoulders with the V.I.P.'s who came here, the judges, the minister of justice, the commissioner of prisons, and I had come to overcome my own prejudice towards them,"" he recalled. ""So I decided to present my colleagues with a fait accompli.""

With an overture to Kobie Coetsee, the justice minister, and a visit to President P. W. Botha, Mr. Mandela, in 1986, began what would be years of negotiations on the future of South Africa. The encounters, remarkably, were characterized by mutual shows of respect. When he occupied the president's office, Mr. Mandela would delightedly show visitors where President Botha had poured him tea.

Mr. Mandela demanded as a show of good will that Walter Sisulu and other defendants in the Rivonia trial be released. President F. W. de Klerk, Mr. Botha's successor, complied.

In the last months of his imprisonment, as the negotiations gathered force, he was relocated to Victor Verster Prison outside Cape Town, where the government could meet with him conveniently and monitor his health. (In prison he had had prostate surgery and lung problems, and the government was terrified of the uproar if he were to die in captivity.) He lived in a warden's bungalow. He had access to a swimming pool, a garden, a chef and a VCR. A suit was tailored for his meetings with government luminaries.

(After his release he built a vacation home near his ancestral village, a brick replica of the warden's house. This was pure pragmatism, he explained: he was accustomed to the floor plan and could find the bathroom at night without stumbling in the dark.)

From the moment they learned of the talks, Mr. Mandela's allies in the A.N.C. were suspicious, and their worries were not allayed when the government allowed them to confer with Mr. Mandela at his quarters in the warden's house.

Tokyo Sexwale, who had come to Robben Island as a student rebel, spoke in a ""Frontline"" interview about encountering Mr. Mandela in this comfortable house. Mr. Mandela walked them through the house, showing off the television and the microwave. ""And,"" Mr. Sexwale said, ""I thought, 'I think you are sold out.' ""

Mr. Mandela seated his visitors at a table and patiently explained his view that the enemy was morally and politically defeated, with nothing left but the army, the country ungovernable. His strategy, he said, was to give the white rulers every chance to retreat in an orderly way. He was preparing to meet Mr. de Klerk, who had just taken over from Mr. Botha.

Free in a Changed World

In February 1990, Mr. Mandela walked out of prison into a world that he knew little, and that knew him less. The African National Congress was now torn by factions -- the prison veterans, those who had spent the years of struggle working legally in labor unions, and the exiles who had spent them in foreign capitals. The white government was also split, with some committed to negotiating an honest new order while others fomented factional violence.

Over the next four years Mr. Mandela would be embroiled in a laborious negotiation, not only with the white government but also with his own fractious alliance.

But first he took time for a victory lap around the world, including an eight-city tour of the United States that began with a motorcade through delirious crowds in New York City.

The anti-apartheid movement had had a rocky relationship with United States governments, which saw South Africa through the lens of the Cold War rivalry with Communists and also regarded the country as an important source of uranium. Until the late 1980s the Central Intelligence Agency portrayed the A.N.C. as Communist-dominated. There have been allegations, neither substantiated nor dispelled, that a C.I.A. agent had tipped the police officers who arrested Mr. Mandela.

Congress, following popular sentiment, enacted economic sanctions against investment in South Africa in 1986, overriding the veto of President Ronald Reagan. Even at the time of his euphoric public welcome in the United States, Mr. Mandela was regarded with some official misgivings, because of both his devotion to economic sanctions and his loyalties to various self-styled liberation figures like Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and Yasir Arafat.

While Mr. Mandela had languished in prison, a campaign of civil disobedience was underway. No one participated more enthusiastically than Winnie Mandela. By the time of her husband's imprisonment, the Mandelas had produced two daughters but had little time to enjoy a domestic life. For most of their marriage they saw each other through the thick glass partition of the prison visiting room: for 21 years of his captivity, they never touched.

She was, however, a megaphone to the outside world, a source of information on friends and comrades and an interpreter of his views through the journalists who came to visit her. She was tormented by the police, jailed and banished with her children to a remote Afrikaner town, Brandfort, where she challenged her captors at every turn.

By the time she was released into the tumult of Soweto in 1984, she had become a firebrand. She now dressed in military khakis and boots and spoke in a violent rhetoric, notoriously endorsing the practice of ""necklacing"" foes, incinerating them in a straitjacket of gasoline-soaked tires. She surrounded herself with young thugs who terrorized, kidnapped and killed blacks she deemed hostile to the cause.

Friends said Mr. Mandela's choice of his cause over his family often filled him with remorse -- so much so that long after Winnie Mandela was widely known to have conducted a reign of terror, long after she was implicated in the kidnapping and murder of young township activists, long after the marriage was effectively dead, Mr. Mandela refused to utter a word of criticism.

As president, he bowed to her popularity by appointing her deputy minister of arts, a position in which she became entangled in financial scandals and increasingly challenged the government for appeasing whites. In 1995 Mr. Mandela finally filed for divorce, which was granted the next year after an emotionally wrenching public hearing.

Mr. Mandela later fell publicly in love with GraÃ§a Machel, widow of the former president of Mozambique and an activist in her own right for humanitarian causes. They married on Mr. Mandela's 80th birthday. She survives him, as do his two daughters by Winnie Mandela, Zenani and Zindziswa; a daughter, Makaziwe, by his first wife; 17 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren.

A Deal for Majority Rule

Two years after Mr. Mandela's release from prison, black and white leaders met in a convention center on the outskirts of Johannesburg for negotiations that would lead, fitfully, to an end of white rule. While out in the country extremists black and white used violence to try to tilt the outcome their way, Mr. Mandela and the white president, Mr. de Klerk, argued and maneuvered toward a peaceful transfer of power.

Mr. Mandela understood the mutual need in his relationship with Mr. de Klerk, a proud, dour, chain-smoking pragmatist, but he never much liked or fully trusted him. Two years into the negotiations, the men were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and their appearance together in Oslo in 1993 was marked by bouts of pique and recriminations. In a conversation a year after becoming president, with Mr. de Klerk as deputy president, Mr. Mandela said he still suspected Mr. de Klerk of complicity in the murders of countless blacks by police and army units, a rogue ""third force"" opposed to black rule.

Eventually, though, Mr. Mandela and his negotiating team, led by the former labor leader Cyril Ramaphosa, found their way to the grand bargain that assured free elections in exchange for promising opposition parties a share of power and a guarantee that whites would not be subjected to reprisals.

At times, the ensuing election campaign seemed in danger of collapsing into chaos. Strife between rival Zulu factions cost hundreds of lives, and white extremists set off bombs at campaign rallies and assassinated the second most popular black figure, Chris Hani.

But the fear was more than offset by the excitement in black townships. Mr. Mandela, wearing a hearing aid and orthopedic socks, soldiered on through 12-hour campaign days, igniting euphoric crowds packed into dusty soccer stadiums and perched on building tops to sing liberation songs and cheer.

During the elections in April 1994, voters lined up in some places for miles. The African National Congress won 62 percent of the vote, earning 252 of the 400 seats in Parliament's National Assembly and ensuring that Mr. Mandela, as party leader, would be named president when Parliament convened.

Mr. Mandela was sworn in as president on May 10, and he accepted office with a speech of shared patriotism, summoning South Africans' communal exhilaration in their land and their common relief at being freed from the world's disapproval.

""Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world,"" he declared.

Then nine Mirage fighter jets of the South African Air Force, originally bought to help keep someone like Mr. Mandela from taking power, roared overhead, and 50,000 roared back from the lawn spread below the government buildings in Pretoria, ""Viva the South African Air Force, viva!""

Limitations as a President

As president, Mr. Mandela set a style that was informal and multiracial. He lived much of the time in a modest house in Johannesburg, where he made his own bed. He enjoyed inviting visiting foreign dignitaries to shake hands with the woman who served them tea.

But he was also casual, even careless, in his relationships with rich capitalists, the mining tycoons, retailers and developers whose continued investment he saw as vital to South Africa's economy. Before the election, he went to 20 industrialists and asked each for at least one million rand ($275,000 at the exchange rate of that time) to build up his party and finance the campaign. In office, he was unabashed about taking their phone calls -- and bristled when unions organized a strike against some of his big donors. He enjoyed socializing with the very rich and the show-business celebrities who flocked to pay homage.

At the same time, he was insistent that the black majority should not expect instant material gratification. He told union leaders at one point to ""tighten your belts"" and accept low wages so that investment would flow. ""We must move from the position of a resistance movement to one of builders,"" he said in an interview.

Mr. Mandela exhibited a genius for the grand gesture of reconciliation. Some attempts, like a tea he organized for prominent A.N.C. women and the wives of apartheid-era white officials, were awkward.

Others were triumphant. Few in South Africa, whatever their race, were unmoved in June 1995 when the South African rugby team, long a symbol of white arrogance, defeated New Zealand in a World Cup final, a moment dramatized in the 2009 film ""Invictus."" Mr. Mandela strode onto the field wearing the team's green jersey, and 80,000 fans, mostly Afrikaners, erupted in a chant of ""Nel-son! Nel-son!""

Mr. Mandela's instinct for compromise in the interest of unity was evident in the 1995 creation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, devised to balance justice and forgiveness in a reckoning of the country's history. The panel offered individual amnesties for anyone who testified fully on the crimes committed during the apartheid period.

In the end, the process fell short of both truth (white officials and A.N.C. leaders were evasive) and reconciliation (many blacks found that information only fed their anger). But it was generally counted a success, giving South Africans who had lost loved ones to secret graves a chance to reclaim their grief, while avoiding the spectacle of endless trials.

There was a limit, though, to how much Mr. Mandela -- by exhortation, by symbolism, by regal appeals to the better natures of his constituents -- could paper over the gulf between white privilege and black privation.

After Mr. Mandela delivered one miracle in the shape of South Africa's freedom, it was perhaps too much to expect that he could deliver another in the form of broad prosperity. In his term, he made only modest progress in fulfilling the modest goals he had set for housing, education and jobs.

He tried with limited success to transform the police from an instrument of white supremacy to an effective crime-fighting force. Corruption and cronyism, which predated majority rule, blossomed. Foreign investment, despite the universal high esteem for Mr. Mandela, kept its distance. Racial divisions, kept in check by the euphoria of the peaceful transition and by Mr. Mandela's moral authority, re-emerged somewhat as the ultimate problem of closing the income gap remained unresolved.

The South African journalist Mark Gevisser, in his 2007 biography of Mr. Mandela's successor as president, Thabo Mbeki, wrote: ""The overriding legacy of the Mandela presidency -- of the years 1994 to 1999 -- is a country where the rule of law was entrenched in an unassailable Bill of Rights, and where the predictions of racial and ethnic conflict did not come true. These feats, alone, guarantee Mandela his sanctity. But he was a far better liberator and nation-builder than he was a governor.""

Mr. Mandela himself deferred to his party, notably in the choice of a successor. After the party favorite, Mr. Mbeki, had ascended to the presidency, Mr. Mandela let it be known that he had actually preferred the younger Mr. Ramaphosa, the former mine workers' union leader who had negotiated the new Constitution. Mr. Mbeki knew and resented that he was not the favorite, and for much of his presidency he snubbed Mr. Mandela.

Mr. Mandela mostly refrained from directly criticizing his successor, but his disappointment was unmistakable when Mr. Mbeki showed his intolerance of criticism and his conspiratorial view of the world. When Mr. Mbeki questioned mainstream medical explanations of the cause of AIDS, stifling open discussion that might have helped cope with a galloping epidemic, Mr. Mandela spoke up on the need for protected sex and cheaper medicines. When his eldest son, Makgatho, died in 2005, Mr. Mandela gathered family members to publicly disclose that the cause was AIDS.

In the 2007 interview, speaking on the condition that he not be quoted until after his death, Mr. Mandela was openly scornful of Mr. Mbeki's leadership. The A.N.C., he said, had always succeeded as a movement and a party because it had drawn on the collective wisdom of its many constituencies.

""There is a great deal of centralization now under President Mbeki, where he takes decisions himself,"" Mr. Mandela declared. ""We never liked that.""

Mr. Mbeki often found it excruciating to govern in Mr. Mandela's shadow. He felt that his predecessor had dealt him a nearly impossible hand -- first by encouraging the notion that South Africa's liberation was the magic of one great black man, and second by emphasizing accommodation with white power and thus doing relatively little to relieve the impoverished black majority.

In interviews published in Mr. Gevisser's biography, Mr. Mbeki chafed at President Mandela's ability to rule by charm and stature, with little attention to the mechanics of governing.

""Madiba didn't pay any attention to what the government was doing,"" Mr. Mbeki said, using the clan name for his predecessor. ""We had to, because somebody had to.""

As a former president, Mr. Mandela lent his charisma to a variety of causes on the African continent, joining peace talks in several wars and assisting his wife, GraÃ§a, in raising money for children's aid organizations.

In 2010, the World Cup soccer games took place in South Africa, another sporting-world benediction of the peace Mr. Mandela did so much to deliver to his country. But for Mr. Mandela, the proud occasion turned to heartbreak when his 13-year-old granddaughter Zenani was killed in an auto accident while returning from an opening-day concert. Mr. Mandela, who had been instrumental in luring the tournament to its first African setting, canceled his plans to attend the opening day.

By then, his hearing and memory shaky, he had already largely withdrawn from public debate, declining almost all interview requests and confining himself to scripted public statements on issues like the war in Iraq. (He was vehemently against it.)

When he received a reporter for the 2007 interview, his aides were already contending with a custody battle over Mr. Mandela's legacy, including where he would be buried and how he would be memorialized. Mr. Mandela insisted that his burial be left to his widow and be done with minimal fanfare.

At the dawn of our Republic, a small, secret surveillance committee borne out of the ""The Sons of Liberty"" was established in Boston.  And the groupâs members included Paul Revere.  At night, they would patrol the streets, reporting back any signs that the British were preparing raids against Americaâs early Patriots.

Throughout American history, intelligence has helped secure our country and our freedoms.  In the Civil War, Union balloon reconnaissance tracked the size of Confederate armies by counting the number of campfires.  In World War II, code-breakers gave us insights into Japanese war plans, and when Patton marched across Europe, intercepted communications helped save the lives of his troops.  After the war, the rise of the Iron Curtain and nuclear weapons only increased the need for sustained intelligence gathering.  And so, in the early days of the Cold War, President Truman created the National Security Agency, or NSA, to give us insights into the Soviet bloc, and provide our leaders with information they needed to confront aggression and avert catastrophe.

Throughout this evolution, we benefited from both our Constitution and our traditions of limited government.  U.S. intelligence agencies were anchored in a system of checks and balances -- with oversight from elected leaders, and protections for ordinary citizens.  Meanwhile, totalitarian states like East Germany offered a cautionary tale of what could happen when vast, unchecked surveillance turned citizens into informers, and persecuted people for what they said in the privacy of their own homes.

In fact, even the United States proved not to be immune to the abuse of surveillance.  And in the 1960s, government spied on civil rights leaders and critics of the Vietnam War.  And partly in response to these revelations, additional laws were established in the 1970s to ensure that our intelligence capabilities could not be misused against our citizens.  In the long, twilight struggle against Communism, we had been reminded that the very liberties that we sought to preserve could not be sacrificed at the altar of national security.

If the fall of the Soviet Union left America without a competing superpower, emerging threats from terrorist groups, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction placed new and in some ways more complicated demands on our intelligence agencies.  Globalization and the Internet made these threats more acute, as technology erased borders and empowered individuals to project great violence, as well as great good.  Moreover, these new threats raised new legal and new policy questions.  For while few doubted the legitimacy of spying on hostile states, our framework of laws was not fully adapted to prevent terrorist attacks by individuals acting on their own, or acting in small, ideologically driven groups on behalf of a foreign power.

The horror of September 11th brought all these issues to the fore.  Across the political spectrum, Americans recognized that we had to adapt to a world in which a bomb could be built in a basement, and our electric grid could be shut down by operators an ocean away.  We were shaken by the signs we had missed leading up to the attacks -- how the hijackers had made phone calls to known extremists and traveled to suspicious places.  So we demanded that our intelligence community improve its capabilities, and that law enforcement change practices to focus more on preventing attacks before they happen than prosecuting terrorists after an attack.

It is hard to overstate the transformation Americaâs intelligence community had to go through after 9/11.  Our agencies suddenly needed to do far more than the traditional mission of monitoring hostile powers and gathering information for policymakers.  Instead, they were now asked to identify and target plotters in some of the most remote parts of the world, and to anticipate the actions of networks that, by their very nature, cannot be easily penetrated with spies or informants.

And it is a testimony to the hard work and dedication of the men and women of our intelligence community that over the past decade weâve made enormous strides in fulfilling this mission.  Today, new capabilities allow intelligence agencies to track who a terrorist is in contact with, and follow the trail of his travel or his funding.  New laws allow information to be collected and shared more quickly and effectively between federal agencies, and state and local law enforcement.  Relationships with foreign intelligence services have expanded, and our capacity to repel cyber-attacks have been strengthened.  And taken together, these efforts have prevented multiple attacks and saved innocent lives -- not just here in the United States, but around the globe.

And yet, in our rush to respond to a very real and novel set of threats, the risk of government overreach -- the possibility that we lose some of our core liberties in pursuit of security -- also became more pronounced.  We saw, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, our government engaged in enhanced interrogation techniques that contradicted our values.  As a Senator, I was critical of several practices, such as warrantless wiretaps.  And all too often new authorities were instituted without adequate public debate.

Through a combination of action by the courts, increased congressional oversight, and adjustments by the previous administration, some of the worst excesses that emerged after 9/11 were curbed by the time I took office.  But a variety of factors have continued to complicate Americaâs efforts to both defend our nation and uphold our civil liberties.

First, the same technological advances that allow U.S. intelligence agencies to pinpoint an al Qaeda cell in Yemen or an email between two terrorists in the Sahel also mean that many routine communications around the world are within our reach.  And at a time when more and more of our lives are digital, that prospect is disquieting for all of us.

Second, the combination of increased digital information and powerful supercomputers offers intelligence agencies the possibility of sifting through massive amounts of bulk data to identify patterns or pursue leads that may thwart impending threats.  Itâs a powerful tool.  But the government collection and storage of such bulk data also creates a potential for abuse.

Third, the legal safeguards that restrict surveillance against U.S. persons without a warrant do not apply to foreign persons overseas.  This is not unique to America; few, if any, spy agencies around the world constrain their activities beyond their own borders.  And the whole point of intelligence is to obtain information that is not publicly available.  But Americaâs capabilities are unique, and the power of new technologies means that there are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do.  That places a special obligation on us to ask tough questions about what we should do.

And finally, intelligence agencies cannot function without secrecy, which makes their work less subject to public debate.  Yet there is an inevitable bias not only within the intelligence community, but among all of us who are responsible for national security, to collect more information about the world, not less.  So in the absence of institutional requirements for regular debate -- and oversight that is public, as well as private or classified -- the danger of government overreach becomes more acute.  And this is particularly true when surveillance technology and our reliance on digital information is evolving much faster than our laws.

For all these reasons, I maintained a healthy skepticism toward our surveillance programs after I became President.  I ordered that our programs be reviewed by my national security team and our lawyers, and in some cases I ordered changes in how we did business.  We increased oversight and auditing, including new structures aimed at compliance.  Improved rules were proposed by the government and approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  And we sought to keep Congress continually updated on these activities.

What I did not do is stop these programs wholesale -- not only because I felt that they made us more secure, but also because nothing in that initial review, and nothing that I have learned since, indicated that our intelligence community has sought to violate the law or is cavalier about the civil liberties of their fellow citizens.

To the contrary, in an extraordinarily difficult job -- one in which actions are second-guessed, success is unreported, and failure can be catastrophic -- the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people.  Theyâre not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls or read your emails.  When mistakes are made -- which is inevitable in any large and complicated human enterprise -- they correct those mistakes.  Laboring in obscurity, often unable to discuss their work even with family and friends, the men and women at the NSA know that if another 9/11 or massive cyber-attack occurs, they will be asked, by Congress and the media, why they failed to connect the dots.  What sustains those who work at NSA and our other intelligence agencies through all these pressures is the knowledge that their professionalism and dedication play a central role in the defense of our nation.

Now, to say that our intelligence community follows the law, and is staffed by patriots, is not to suggest that I or others in my administration felt complacent about the potential impact of these programs.  Those of us who hold office in America have a responsibility to our Constitution, and while I was confident in the integrity of those who lead our intelligence community, it was clear to me in observing our intelligence operations on a regular basis that changes in our technological capabilities were raising new questions about the privacy safeguards currently in place.

Moreover, after an extended review of our use of drones in the fight against terrorist networks, I believed a fresh examination of our surveillance programs was a necessary next step in our effort to get off the open-ended war footing that weâve maintained since 9/11.  And for these reasons, I indicated in a speech at the National Defense University last May that we needed a more robust public discussion about the balance between security and liberty.  Of course, what I did not know at the time is that within weeks of my speech, an avalanche of unauthorized disclosures would spark controversies at home and abroad that have continued to this day.

And given the fact of an open investigation, Iâm not going to dwell on Mr. Snowdenâs actions or his motivations; I will say that our nationâs defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nationâs secrets.  If any individual who objects to government policy can take it into their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will not be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy.  Moreover, the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light, while revealing methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations in ways that we may not fully understand for years to come.

Regardless of how we got here, though, the task before us now is greater than simply repairing the damage done to our operations or preventing more disclosures from taking place in the future.  Instead, we have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves and sustain our leadership in the world, while upholding the civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals and our Constitution require.  We need to do so not only because it is right, but because the challenges posed by threats like terrorism and proliferation and cyber-attacks are not going away any time soon.  They are going to continue to be a major problem.  And for our intelligence community to be effective over the long haul, we must maintain the trust of the American people, and people around the world.

This effort will not be completed overnight, and given the pace of technological change, we shouldnât expect this to be the last time America has this debate.  But I want the American people to know that the work has begun.  Over the last six months, I created an outside Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies to make recommendations for reform.  I consulted with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, created by Congress.  Iâve listened to foreign partners, privacy advocates, and industry leaders.  My administration has spent countless hours considering how to approach intelligence in this era of diffuse threats and technological revolution.  So before outlining specific changes that Iâve ordered, let me make a few broad observations that have emerged from this process.

First, everyone who has looked at these problems, including skeptics of existing programs, recognizes that we have real enemies and threats, and that intelligence serves a vital role in confronting them.  We cannot prevent terrorist attacks or cyber threats without some capability to penetrate digital communications -- whether itâs to unravel a terrorist plot; to intercept malware that targets a stock exchange; to make sure air traffic control systems are not compromised; or to ensure that hackers do not empty your bank accounts.  We are expected to protect the American people; that requires us to have capabilities in this field.

Moreover, we cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies.  There is a reason why BlackBerrys and iPhones are not allowed in the White House Situation Room.  We know that the intelligence services of other countries -- including some who feign surprise over the Snowden disclosures -- are constantly probing our government and private sector networks, and accelerating programs to listen to our conversations, and intercept our emails, and compromise our systems.  We know that.

Meanwhile, a number of countries, including some who have loudly criticized the NSA, privately acknowledge that America has special responsibilities as the worldâs only superpower; that our intelligence capabilities are critical to meeting these responsibilities, and that they themselves have relied on the information we obtain to protect their own people.

Second, just as ardent civil libertarians recognize the need for robust intelligence capabilities, those with responsibilities for our national security readily acknowledge the potential for abuse as intelligence capabilities advance and more and more private information is digitized.  After all, the folks at NSA and other intelligence agencies are our neighbors.  They're our friends and family.  Theyâve got electronic bank and medical records like everybody else.  They have kids on Facebook and Instagram, and they know, more than most of us, the vulnerabilities to privacy that exist in a world where transactions are recorded, and emails and text and messages are stored, and even our movements can increasingly be tracked through the GPS on our phones.

Third, there was a recognition by all who participated in these reviews that the challenges to our privacy do not come from government alone.  Corporations of all shapes and sizes track what you buy, store and analyze our data, and use it for commercial purposes; thatâs how those targeted ads pop up on your computer and your smartphone periodically.  But all of us understand that the standards for government surveillance must be higher.  Given the unique power of the state, it is not enough for leaders to say:  Trust us, we wonât abuse the data we collect.  For history has too many examples when that trust has been breached.  Our system of government is built on the premise that our liberty cannot depend on the good intentions of those in power; it depends on the law to constrain those in power.

I make these observations to underscore that the basic values of most Americans when it comes to questions of surveillance and privacy converge a lot more than the crude characterizations that have emerged over the last several months.  Those who are troubled by our existing programs are not interested in repeating the tragedy of 9/11, and those who defend these programs are not dismissive of civil liberties.

The challenge is getting the details right, and that is not simple.  In fact, during the course of our review, I have often reminded myself I would not be where I am today were it not for the courage of dissidents like Dr. King, who were spied upon by their own government.  And as President, a President who looks at intelligence every morning, I also canât help but be reminded that America must be vigilant in the face of threats.

Fortunately, by focusing on facts and specifics rather than speculation and hypotheticals, this review process has given me -- and hopefully the American people -- some clear direction for change.  And today, I can announce a series of concrete and substantial reforms that my administration intends to adopt administratively or will seek to codify with Congress.

First, I have approved a new presidential directive for our signals intelligence activities both at home and abroad.  This guidance will strengthen executive branch oversight of our intelligence activities.  It will ensure that we take into account our security requirements, but also our alliances; our trade and investment relationships, including the concerns of American companies; and our commitment to privacy and basic liberties.  And we will review decisions about intelligence priorities and sensitive targets on an annual basis so that our actions are regularly scrutinized by my senior national security team.

Second, we will reform programs and procedures in place to provide greater transparency to our surveillance activities, and fortify the safeguards that protect the privacy of U.S. persons.  Since we began this review, including information being released today, we have declassified over 40 opinions and orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which provides judicial review of some of our most sensitive intelligence activities -- including the Section 702 program targeting foreign individuals overseas, and the Section 215 telephone metadata program.

And going forward, Iâm directing the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Attorney General, to annually review for the purposes of declassification any future opinions of the court with broad privacy implications, and to report to me and to Congress on these efforts.  To ensure that the court hears a broader range of privacy perspectives, I am also calling on Congress to authorize the establishment of a panel of advocates from outside government to provide an independent voice in significant cases before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Third, we will provide additional protections for activities conducted under Section 702, which allows the government to intercept the communications of foreign targets overseas who have information thatâs important for our national security.  Specifically, I am asking the Attorney General and DNI to institute reforms that place additional restrictions on governmentâs ability to retain, search, and use in criminal cases communications between Americans and foreign citizens incidentally collected under Section 702.

Fourth, in investigating threats, the FBI also relies on what's called national security letters, which can require companies to provide specific and limited information to the government without disclosing the orders to the subject of the investigation.  These are cases in which it's important that the subject of the investigation, such as a possible terrorist or spy, isnât tipped off.  But we can and should be more transparent in how government uses this authority.

I have therefore directed the Attorney General to amend how we use national security letters so that this secrecy will not be indefinite, so that it will terminate within a fixed time unless the government demonstrates a real need for further secrecy.  We will also enable communications providers to make public more information than ever before about the orders that they have received to provide data to the government.

This brings me to the program that has generated the most controversy these past few months -- the bulk collection of telephone records under Section 215.  Let me repeat what I said when this story first broke:  This program does not involve the content of phone calls, or the names of people making calls.  Instead, it provides a record of phone numbers and the times and lengths of calls -- metadata that can be queried if and when we have a reasonable suspicion that a particular number is linked to a terrorist organization.

Why is this necessary?  The program grew out of a desire to address a gap identified after 9/11.  One of the 9/11 hijackers -- Khalid al-Mihdhar -- made a phone call from San Diego to a known al Qaeda safe-house in Yemen.  NSA saw that call, but it could not see that the call was coming from an individual already in the United States.  The telephone metadata program under Section 215 was designed to map the communications of terrorists so we can see who they may be in contact with as quickly as possible.  And this capability could also prove valuable in a crisis.  For example, if a bomb goes off in one of our cities and law enforcement is racing to determine whether a network is poised to conduct additional attacks, time is of the essence.  Being able to quickly review phone connections to assess whether a network exists is critical to that effort.

In sum, the program does not involve the NSA examining the phone records of ordinary Americans.  Rather, it consolidates these records into a database that the government can query if it has a specific lead -- a consolidation of phone records that the companies already retained for business purposes.  The review group turned up no indication that this database has been intentionally abused.  And I believe it is important that the capability that this program is designed to meet is preserved.

Having said that, I believe critics are right to point out that without proper safeguards, this type of program could be used to yield more information about our private lives, and open the door to more intrusive bulk collection programs in the future.  Theyâre also right to point out that although the telephone bulk collection program was subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and has been reauthorized repeatedly by Congress, it has never been subject to vigorous public debate.

For all these reasons, I believe we need a new approach.  I am therefore ordering a transition that will end the Section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists, and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the government holding this bulk metadata.

This will not be simple.  The review group recommended that our current approach be replaced by one in which the providers or a third party retain the bulk records, with government accessing information as needed.  Both of these options pose difficult problems.  Relying solely on the records of multiple providers, for example, could require companies to alter their procedures in ways that raise new privacy concerns.  On the other hand, any third party maintaining a single, consolidated database would be carrying out what is essentially a government function but with more expense, more legal ambiguity, potentially less accountability -- all of which would have a doubtful impact on increasing public confidence that their privacy is being protected.

During the review process, some suggested that we may also be able to preserve the capabilities we need through a combination of existing authorities, better information sharing, and recent technological advances.  But more work needs to be done to determine exactly how this system might work.

Because of the challenges involved, Iâve ordered that the transition away from the existing program will proceed in two steps.  Effective immediately, we will only pursue phone calls that are two steps removed from a number associated with a terrorist organization instead of the current three.  And I have directed the Attorney General to work with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court so that during this transition period, the database can be queried only after a judicial finding or in the case of a true emergency.

Next, step two, I have instructed the intelligence community and the Attorney General to use this transition period to develop options for a new approach that can match the capabilities and fill the gaps that the Section 215 program was designed to address without the government holding this metadata itself.  They will report back to me with options for alternative approaches before the program comes up for reauthorization on March 28th.  And during this period, I will consult with the relevant committees in Congress to seek their views, and then seek congressional authorization for the new program as needed.

Now, the reforms Iâm proposing today should give the American people greater confidence that their rights are being protected, even as our intelligence and law enforcement agencies maintain the tools they need to keep us safe.  And I recognize that there are additional issues that require further debate.  For example, some who participated in our review, as well as some members of Congress, would like to see more sweeping reforms to the use of national security letters so that we have to go to a judge each time before issuing these requests.  Here, I have concerns that we should not set a standard for terrorism investigations that is higher than those involved in investigating an ordinary crime.  But I agree that greater oversight on the use of these letters may be appropriate, and Iâm prepared to work with Congress on this issue.

There are also those who would like to see different changes to the FISA Court than the ones Iâve proposed.  On all these issues, I am open to working with Congress to ensure that we build a broad consensus for how to move forward, and Iâm confident that we can shape an approach that meets our security needs while upholding the civil liberties of every American.

Let me now turn to the separate set of concerns that have been raised overseas, and focus on Americaâs approach to intelligence collection abroad.  As Iâve indicated, the United States has unique responsibilities when it comes to intelligence collection.  Our capabilities help protect not only our nation, but our friends and our allies, as well.  But our efforts will only be effective if ordinary citizens in other countries have confidence that the United States respects their privacy, too.  And the leaders of our close friends and allies deserve to know that if I want to know what they think about an issue, Iâll pick up the phone and call them, rather than turning to surveillance.  In other words, just as we balance security and privacy at home, our global leadership demands that we balance our security requirements against our need to maintain the trust and cooperation among people and leaders around the world.

For that reason, the new presidential directive that Iâve issued today will clearly prescribe what we do, and do not do, when it comes to our overseas surveillance.  To begin with, the directive makes clear that the United States only uses signals intelligence for legitimate national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary folks.  Iâve also made it clear that the United States does not collect intelligence to suppress criticism or dissent, nor do we collect intelligence to disadvantage people on the basis of their ethnicity, or race, or gender, or sexual orientation, or religious beliefs.  We do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to U.S. companies or U.S. commercial sectors.

And in terms of our bulk collection of signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies will only use such data to meet specific security requirements:  counterintelligence, counterterrorism, counter-proliferation, cybersecurity, force protection for our troops and our allies, and combating transnational crime, including sanctions evasion.

In this directive, I have taken the unprecedented step of extending certain protections that we have for the American people to people overseas.  Iâve directed the DNI, in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop these safeguards, which will limit the duration that we can hold personal information, while also restricting the use of this information.

The bottom line is that people around the world, regardless of their nationality, should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who donât threaten our national security, and that we take their privacy concerns into account in our policies and procedures.  This applies to foreign leaders as well.  Given the understandable attention that this issue has received, I have made clear to the intelligence community that unless there is a compelling national security purpose, we will not monitor the communications of heads of state and government of our close friends and allies.  And Iâve instructed my national security team, as well as the intelligence community, to work with foreign counterparts to deepen our coordination and cooperation in ways that rebuild trust going forward.

Now let me be clear:  Our intelligence agencies will continue to gather information about the intentions of governments -- as opposed to ordinary citizens -- around the world, in the same way that the intelligence services of every other nation does.  We will not apologize simply because our services may be more effective.  But heads of state and government with whom we work closely, and on whose cooperation we depend, should feel confident that we are treating them as real partners.  And the changes Iâve ordered do just that.

Finally, to make sure that we follow through on all these reforms, I am making some important changes to how our government is organized.  The State Department will designate a senior officer to coordinate our diplomacy on issues related to technology and signals intelligence.  We will appoint a senior official at the White House to implement the new privacy safeguards that I have announced today.  I will devote the resources to centralize and improve the process we use to handle foreign requests for legal assistance, keeping our high standards for privacy while helping foreign partners fight crime and terrorism.

I have also asked my counselor, John Podesta, to lead a comprehensive review of big data and privacy.  And this group will consist of government officials who, along with the Presidentâs Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, will reach out to privacy experts, technologists and business leaders, and look how the challenges inherent in big data are being confronted by both the public and private sectors; whether we can forge international norms on how to manage this data; and how we can continue to promote the free flow of information in ways that are consistent with both privacy and security.

For ultimately, whatâs at stake in this debate goes far beyond a few months of headlines, or passing tensions in our foreign policy.  When you cut through the noise, whatâs really at stake is how we remain true to who we are in a world that is remaking itself at dizzying speed.  Whether itâs the ability of individuals to communicate ideas; to access information that would have once filled every great library in every country in the world; or to forge bonds with people on other sides of the globe, technology is remaking what is possible for individuals, and for institutions, and for the international order.  So while the reforms that I have announced will point us in a new direction, I am mindful that more work will be needed in the future.

One thing Iâm certain of:  This debate will make us stronger.  And I also know that in this time of change, the United States of America will have to lead.  It may seem sometimes that America is being held to a different standard.  And I'll admit the readiness of some to assume the worst motives by our government can be frustrating.  No one expects China to have an open debate about their surveillance programs, or Russia to take privacy concerns of citizens in other places into account.  But letâs remember:  We are held to a different standard precisely because we have been at the forefront of defending personal privacy and human dignity.

As the nation that developed the Internet, the world expects us to ensure that the digital revolution works as a tool for individual empowerment, not government control.  Having faced down the dangers of totalitarianism and fascism and communism, the world expects us to stand up for the principle that every person has the right to think and write and form relationships freely -- because individual freedom is the wellspring of human progress.

Those values make us who we are.  And because of the strength of our own democracy, we should not shy away from high expectations.  For more than two centuries, our Constitution has weathered every type of change because we have been willing to defend it, and because we have been willing to question the actions that have been taken in its defense.  Today is no different.  I believe we can meet high expectations.  Together, let us chart a way forward that secures the life of our nation while preserving the liberties that make our nation worth fighting for.

Thank you.  God bless you.  May God bless the United States of America.

","President Barack Obama's plan to curtail the government's mass collection of American phone data shakes up U.S. spying practices amid a world-wide firestorm over revelations about the nation's surveillance programs.

But Mr. Obama, promising a continued review, left large swaths of the surveillance programs unchanged, and many of his proposals for overhauling them still face congressional debate and approval.

The president's plan, which drew mixed reactions from both sides of the surveillance debate after he announced them in a speech Friday, sets the stage for possible conflicts with intelligence officials and their allies in Congress.

In one of the biggest changes, he said the government would stop storing huge amounts of telephone data in NSA computers, but he hasn't determined where the databases will be located, such as at phone companies. Instead, he asked the attorney general and intelligence officials to work with Congress to come up with alternative locations within 60 days. That could prove difficult.

Other changes will take effect immediately. Intelligence officials now must seek approval from a secret national-security court before conducting searches of a person's phone data, Mr. Obama said. In addition, data searches have been scaled back, so that investigators may only examine personal connections that are two steps removed from a target, instead of three.

Mr. Obama also adopted new privacy protections for non-U.S. citizens and ended government spying on heads of state of close American allies, though monitoring leaders' staff members wasn't prohibited.

Mr. Obama never mentioned two issues that have upset U.S. technology executives, who worry about losing business overseas -- reports of secret government taps on overseas data centers and the weakening of encryption standards.

The president said he recognized many surveillance issues weren't settled, and cast the changes as an attempt to balance national security with privacy and civil-liberties concerns.

""The reforms I'm proposing today should give the American people greater confidence that their rights are being protected, even as our intelligence and law-enforcement agencies maintain the tools they need to keep us safe,"" he said in the speech delivered at the Justice Department.

As a whole, the overhauls of NSA practices both at home and overseas comprise the most significant revision of U.S. surveillance in more than a decade. They focus primarily on three types of spy operations: mass collection of phone records, mass collection of foreign communications and the monitoring of foreign leaders. The overhaul also includes changes to the court that oversees NSA surveillance.

The government's bulk phone-data collection has come under the most intense debate, and senior administration officials say Mr. Obama was still wrestling the day before his speech with potential changes to the program. He didn't decide until Thursday night on some elements of his plan, including the requirement of court orders for records searches.

Mr. Obama's speech marked an inflection point in a debate over surveillance programs that began after their creation by the Bush administration in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. It was reignited last spring by a series of highly sensitive leaks by former government contractor Edward Snowden, who is now a fugitive in Moscow.

Mr. Obama's plan satisfied some of the most vocal critics of NSA surveillance on Capitol Hill.

In a joint statement, Sens. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), Mark Udall (D., Colo.), and Martin Heinrich (D., N.M.), members of the Senate intelligence committee who have pushed for privacy protections, called Mr. Obama's decision to move bulk data storage out of the NSA ""a major milestone.""

But unanswered questions about how the directives will be implemented -- in particular, where phone data will be housed outside the government -- have left some uneasy.

""The major disappointment is the president does not commit to ending government collection and retention of Americans' bulk data,"" said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""Bulk-data collection and retention is the quintessential unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment.""

Some Republicans were uneasy for the opposite reason, suggesting the new restrictions could hamper security programs. ""When lives are stake, the president must not allow politics to cloud his judgment,"" said House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio). ""I look forward to learning more about how the new procedure for accessing data will not put Americans at greater risk.""

Some new rules are unsettling for the intelligence community. Requiring a judge's order for data searches, for instance, appeals to many privacy advocates. But some intelligence leaders have said the change is needless, cumbersome and will slow inquiries.

The leaders of the Senate and House intelligence committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Mich.), questioned that change.

""If instituted, that approval process must be made faster in the future than it was in the past -- when it took up to nine days to gain court approval for a single search,"" they said in a joint statement.

Mr. Obama said that while new rules are being developed, searches could be made without court orders ""in the case of a true emergency.""

Mr. Obama tried to balance the interests of those on both sides of the debate. He defended U.S. intelligence practices in his speech, saying they have helped foil terrorist plots. But he also conceded the way they are structured opens up the potential for abuse.

""The power of new technologies means that there are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do,"" Mr. Obama said. ""That places a special obligation on us to ask tough questions about what we should do.""

Mr. Obama didn't adopt one recommendation for greater court oversight from a review panel, which urged that the Federal Bureau of Investigation be required to obtain court approval before issuing so-called national-security letters demanding information from businesses and organizations. Instead, Mr. Obama asked the attorney general to make the process more transparent and allow recipients of such letters to make more information public. Currently, companies cannot ever acknowledge they have received a letter.

As part of his overhaul, Mr. Obama established a new process to evaluate surveillance operations yearly, weighing costs and benefits of monitoring a particular individual. He also ordered a continuing review of classified opinions of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to determine if future opinions can be made public.

The Office of Director of National Intelligence late Friday declassified and released two dozen previously secret court orders that chronicle renewals of the phone-data program.

Mr. Obama spelled out new privacy protections for non-U.S. citizens, specifying that surveillance will only be done for national-security purposes. He also shortened the amount of time the NSA can retain communications data on non-U.S. citizens.

""The bottom line is that people around the world -- regardless of their nationality -- should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't threaten our national security, and that we take their privacy concerns into account,"" Mr. Obama said. ""This applies to foreign leaders as well.""

Officials of foreign governments greeted Mr. Obama's address with a mix of skepticism and measured support, suggesting Washington still has a way to go to quell the chorus of outrage that followed revelations last year of NSA spying on non-U.S. citizens and foreign leaders.

Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade noted in an interview on Mexican radio a positive reaction from Europe and elsewhere. ""We have to . . . be certain that it will give us the security we need to continue working on the basis of confidence on shared problems,"" he said.

Last year, Mexico demanded an investigation by the U.S. government into reports that the NSA spied on text messages of President Enrique Pena Nieto when he was still a candidate.
","President Obama, acknowledging that high-tech surveillance poses a threat to civil liberties, announced significant changes on Friday to the way the government collects and uses telephone records, but left in place many other pillars of the nation's intelligence programs.

Responding to the clamor over sensational disclosures about the National Security Agency's spying practices, Mr. Obama said he would restrict the ability of intelligence agencies to gain access to phone records, and would ultimately move that data out of the hands of the government.

But in a speech at the Justice Department that seemed more calculated to reassure audiences at home and abroad than to force radical change, Mr. Obama defended the need for the broad surveillance net assembled by the N.S.A. And he turned to Congress and the intelligence agencies themselves to work out the details of any changes.

""America's capabilities are unique,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And the power of new technologies means that there are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do. That places a special obligation on us to ask tough questions about what we should do.""

Invoking lofty principles and then going into a highly technical discussion of the N.S.A.'s procedures, Mr. Obama said he would require prior court approval each time an agency analyst wants access to calling records, except in emergencies. He also said he had forbidden eavesdropping on the leaders of allied countries, after the disclosure of such activities ignited a diplomatic firestorm with Germany, Brazil and other countries.

The full extent of that surveillance has not been publicly acknowledged, but a senior administration official said that the surveillance of dozens of foreign leaders has ended.

The president insisted there was no evidence the N.S.A. had abused its power, and said that many of its practices were necessary to protect Americans from a host of threats since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Mr. Obama's carefully calibrated proposals offered little comfort to civil-liberties advocates hoping for a thorough overhaul of the N.S.A.'s practices.

For example, Mr. Obama did not accept one of the most far-reaching recommendations of his own advisory panel on surveillance practices: requiring court approval for so-called national security letters, a kind of subpoena allowing the F.B.I. to obtain information about people from their banks, cellphone providers and other companies.

With the president setting in motion multiple internal administration reviews and asking Congress to take up some of the most difficult issues, the debate over surveillance practices is likely to continue unabated, eight months after it was touched off by the disclosure of classified information by a former N.S.A. contractor, Edward J. Snowden.

Mr. Obama made only a brief, critical reference to Mr. Snowden, saying his actions had jeopardized the nation's defense and framed a debate that has ""often shed more heat than light.""

Still, noting his own record of opposition to intrusive surveillance and the ""cautionary tale"" of unchecked state spying in countries like the former East Germany, Mr. Obama said the disclosures raised genuine issues of the balance between liberty and security.

""When you cut through the noise,"" the president said, ""what's really at stake is how we remain true to who we are in a world that is remaking itself at dizzying speed.""

Though Mr. Obama has been weighing these changes for months, he made a final decision on the court order for gaining access to phone records only on Thursday night, an official said, attesting to the extreme delicacy of these issues and the competing interests at play.

Mr. Obama's stated intent to get the government out of the business of warehousing Americans' calling data in bulk may prove easier said than done. The phone companies have resisted taking on that role, which raises an array of difficulties, as Mr. Obama acknowledged in his speech.

The president gave Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. 60 days to come back with recommendations; the government, for the time being, will continue to collect the data until Congress decides where ultimately it should be held.

Civil-liberties groups and lawmakers who have been critical of the N.S.A.'s practices appeared divided over whether Mr. Obama's proposal on bulk phone records should be greeted with applause or wariness.

Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Tom Udall of New Mexico and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico -- three Democrats on the Intelligence Committee who have been outspoken critics of government surveillance -- jointly called Mr. Obama's embrace of that goal ""a major milestone,"" although they said they would continue to push for other overhauls Mr. Obama did not endorse.

But Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, was more skeptical, noting that Mr. Obama had warned of hurdles with moving the data into private hands. ""The bulk collection and retention of data in government warehouses, government facilities, seems to still be an open question,"" he said.

For analysts working at the N.S.A., Mr. Obama's changes will have two immediate effects. They will be able to scrutinize phone calls that are only two steps removed from a number associated with a terrorism suspect, rather than three.

And, when the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court signs off on new procedures, the analysts will first have to persuade a judge that there is reason to scrutinize callers linked to a particular phone number, though Mr. Obama left a loophole allowing the N.S.A. to act on its own in a ""true emergency,"" with after-the-fact judicial review.

While nothing in federal statutes explicitly gives the court the authority to grant requests to obtain the data, the Justice Department decided that it would most likely consent to doing so, in part because for a period several years ago, the court signed off on each query, officials said.

Two strong defenders of the N.S.A., the leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, focused on that change as a potential problem.

""If instituted, that approval process must be made faster in the future than it was in the past -- when it took up to nine days to gain court approval for a single search,"" they said in a joint statement.

Mr. Obama also said he was taking the ""unprecedented step"" of extending privacy safeguards to non-Americans, including requiring that data collected abroad be deleted after a certain period and limiting its use to specific security requirements, like counterterrorism and cybersecurity.

""The bottom line,"" he said, ""is that people around the world -- regardless of their nationality -- should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't threaten our national security.""

Mr. Romero said Mr. Obama's promotion of privacy protections for noncitizens abroad was a ""breakthrough moment."" Still, a senior intelligence official has said that most of the new requirements essentially codified what the N.S.A.'s practices have already been.

The president did not specify which foreign leaders would be on the no-spying list. But, he said, ""Heads of state and government with whom we work closely, and on whose cooperation we depend, should feel confident that we are treating them as real partners.""

Mr. Obama made no mention of two of the recommendations of his panel of most pressing concern to Silicon Valley: that the N.S.A. not undermine commercial software, and that it move away from exploiting flaws in software to conduct cyberattacks or surveillance.

To confront the broader privacy issues raised by the amassing and storage of personal data, Mr. Obama said he had appointed John D. Podesta, who recently joined the White House as a senior adviser, to lead an administration review.

Modifying a proposal from his advisory group, Mr. Obama proposed a panel of advocates on privacy and technology issues that would appear before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. But the panel, composed of part-time lawyers, would be called on only in ""novel"" cases, rather than in every case. Left unclear was who would decide which cases are novel.

65,65,2014-01-29-StateoftheUnion.txt,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:

Today in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it, and did her part to lift America's graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades.

An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup, and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years. 

An autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the world, and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil.

A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history.  A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford.  A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son.  And in tight-knit communities across America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that, after twelve long years, is finally coming to an end.

Tonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: it is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong.

Here are the results of your efforts:  The lowest unemployment rate in over five years.  A rebounding housing market.  A manufacturing sector that's adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s.  More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world -- the first time that's happened in nearly twenty years.  Our deficits -- cut by more than half.  And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world's number one place to invest; America is.

That's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America.  After five years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.

The question for everyone in this chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress.  For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government.  It's an important debate -- one that dates back to our very founding.  But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy -- when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States -- then we are not doing right by the American people.

As President, I'm committed to making Washington work better, and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here.  I believe most of you are, too.  Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year's severe cuts to priorities like education.  Nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country's future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way.  But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises.

In the coming months, let's see where else we can make progress together.  Let's make this a year of action.  That's what most Americans want -- for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.  And what I believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all -- the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead.

Let's face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows.  Over more than three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on.

Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better.  But average wages have barely budged.  Inequality has deepened.  Upward mobility has stalled.  The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by -- let alone get ahead.  And too many still aren't working at all.

Our job is to reverse these trends.  It won't happen right away, and we won't agree on everything.  But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class.  Some require Congressional action, and I'm eager to work with all of you.  But America does not stand still -- and neither will I.  So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do. 

As usual, our First Lady sets a good example.  Michelle's Let's Move partnership with schools, businesses, and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years -- an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come.  The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses.  Taking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already, 150 universities, businesses, and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education -- and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus.  Across the country, we're partnering with mayors, governors, and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality.

The point is, there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, and are moving this country forward.  They believe, and I believe, that here in America, our success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams.  That's what drew our forebears here.  It's how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America's largest automaker; how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House; how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth. 

Opportunity is who we are.  And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise.

We know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job.  With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year.  And over half of big manufacturers say they're thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad.

So let's make that decision easier for more companies.  Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad.  Let's flip that equation.  Let's work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home.

Moreover, we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes -- because in today's global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure.  We'll need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.  But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.

We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs.  My administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown, where we've connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies.  Tonight, I'm announcing we'll launch six more this year.  Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create.  So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work.

Let's do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America.  Over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other.  And when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create more jobs.  We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped ""Made in the USA.""  China and Europe aren't standing on the sidelines.  Neither should we.

We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow.  This is an edge America cannot surrender.  Federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones.  That's why Congress should undo the damage done by last year's cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery -- whether it's vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria, or paper-thin material that's stronger than steel.  And let's pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation.

Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy.  The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we've been in decades.

One of the reasons why is natural gas -- if extracted safely, it's the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change.  Businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas.  I'll cut red tape to help states get those factories built, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas.  My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our communities.  And while we're at it, I'll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations.

It's not just oil and natural gas production that's booming; we're becoming a global leader in solar, too.  Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can't be outsourced.  Let's continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don't need it, so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do.

And even as we've increased energy production, we've partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume.  When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars.  In the coming months, I'll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks, so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump.

Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet.  Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.  But we have to act with more urgency -- because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods.  That's why I directed my administration to work with states, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air.  The shift to a cleaner energy economy won't happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way.  But the debate is settled.  Climate change is a fact.  And when our children's children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did.

Finally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement -- and fix our broken immigration system.  Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted.  I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same.  Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.  And for good reason: when people come here to fulfill their dreams -- to study, invent, and contribute to our culture -- they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone.  So let's get immigration reform done this year.

The ideas I've outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.  But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs.

The good news is, we know how to do it.  Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit.  She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in America, and she knew how to make them.  She just needed the workforce.  So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center -- places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job, or better job.  She was flooded with new workers.  And today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees.

What Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer -- and every job seeker.  So tonight, I've asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of America's training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now.  That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life.  It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs.  And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs.

I'm also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it's more effective in today's economy.  But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people.

Let me tell you why.

Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She'd been steadily employed since she was a teenager.  She put herself through college.  She'd never collected unemployment benefits.  In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home.  A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved.  Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter -- the kind I get every day.  ""We are the face of the unemployment crisis,"" she wrote.  ""I am not dependent on the governmentâ¦Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to societyâ¦care about our neighborsâ¦I am confident that in time I will find a jobâ¦I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love.  Please give us this chance.""

Congress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance.  They need our help, but more important, this country needs them in the game.  That's why I've been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families; this week, many will come to the White House to make that commitment real.  Tonight, I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same -- because we are stronger when America fields a full team. 

Of course, it's not enough to train today's workforce.  We also have to prepare tomorrow's workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education.

Estiven Rodriguez couldn't speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine.  But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates -- through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors -- from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications.  And this son of a factory worker just found out he's going to college this fall.

Five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids.  We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before.  Race to the Top, with the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise expectations and performance.  Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy -- problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, and math.  Some of this change is hard.  It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test.  But it's worth it -- and it's working. 

The problem is we're still not reaching enough kids, and we're not reaching them in time.  That has to change. 

Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child's life is high-quality early education.  Last year, I asked this Congress to help states make high-quality pre-K available to every four year-old.  As a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight. But in the meantime, thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own.  They know we can't wait.  So just as we worked with states to reform our schools, this year, we'll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children.  And as Congress decides what it's going to do, I'm going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K they need.

Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years.  Tonight, I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we've got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit. 

We're working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career.  We're shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information, and colleges more incentives to offer better value, so that no middle-class kid is priced out of a college education.  We're offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt.  And I'm reaching out to some of America's leading foundations and corporations on a new initiative to help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential.

The bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us.  But we know our opportunity agenda won't be complete -- and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise -- unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays off for every single American. 

Today, women make up about half our workforce.  But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.  That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work.  She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job.  A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship -- and you know what, a father does, too.  It's time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a ""Mad Men"" episode.  This year, let's all come together -- Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street -- to give every woman the opportunity she deserves.  Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds.

Now, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs -- but they're not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages.  Americans understand that some people will earn more than others, and we don't resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success.  But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty.

In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five states have passed laws to raise theirs.  Many businesses have done it on their own.  Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss, John Soranno.  John's an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough.  Only now he makes more of it: John just gave his employees a raise, to ten bucks an hour -- a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale.

Tonight, I ask more of America's business leaders to follow John's lead and do what you can to raise your employees' wages.  To every mayor, governor, and state legislator in America, I say, you don't have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on.  And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. We should too.  In the coming weeks, I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour -- because if you cook our troops' meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn't have to live in poverty.

Of course, to reach millions more, Congress needs to get on board. Today, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here.  Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10.  This will help families.  It will give businesses customers with more money to spend.  It doesn't involve any new bureaucratic program.  So join the rest of the country.  Say yes.  Give America a raise.

There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point.  But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn't do enough for single workers who don't have kids.  So let's work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead.

Let's do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most workers don't have a pension.  A Social Security check often isn't enough on its own.  And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn't help folks who don't have 401ks.  That's why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It's a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.  MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.  And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for middle-class Americans.  Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.  And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans.

One last point on financial security.  For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system.  And in case you haven't heard, we're in the process of fixing that.

A pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn't get health insurance.  But on January 1st, she got covered.  On January 3rd, she felt a sharp pain.  On January 6th, she had emergency surgery.  Just one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would've meant bankruptcy.

That's what health insurance reform is all about -- the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don't have to lose everything. 

Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents' plans.

More than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage.

And here's another number: zero.  Because of this law, no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain, or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more just because she's a woman.  And we did all this while adding years to Medicare's finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors.

Now, I don't expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law.  But I know that the American people aren't interested in refighting old battles.  So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and increase choice -- tell America what you'd do differently.  Let's see if the numbers add up.  But let's not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of Americans like Amanda.  The first forty were plenty.  We got it.  We all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not just what we're against. 

And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who's here tonight.  Kentucky's not the most liberal part of the country, but he's like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth's families.  ""They are our friends and neighbors,"" he said.  ""They are people we shop and go to church withâ¦farmers out on the tractorsâ¦grocery clerksâ¦they are people who go to work every morning praying they don't get sick.  No one deserves to live that way."" 

Steve's right.  That's why, tonight, I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st.  Moms, get on your kids to sign up.  Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application.  It will give her some peace of mind -- plus, she'll appreciate hearing from you. 

After all, that's the spirit that has always moved this nation forward.  It's the spirit of citizenship -- the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well.

Citizenship means standing up for everyone's right to vote.  Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened.  But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it; and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote.  Let's support these efforts.  It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy.

Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day.  I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say ""we are not afraid,"" and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook.

Citizenship demands a sense of common cause; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.  And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.

Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure.  When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, all our troops are out of Iraq.  More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan.  With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America's longest war will finally be over.

After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future.  If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces, and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda.  For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country.

The fact is, that danger remains.  While we have put al Qaeda's core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks. In Syria, we'll support the opposition that rejects  the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at home, we'll keep strengthening our defenses, and combat new threats like cyberattacks.  And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform, and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions.

We have to remain vigilant.  But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone. As Commander-in-Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office.  But I will not send our troops into harm's way unless it's truly necessary; nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts.  We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us -- large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism.

So, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks -- through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners -- America must move off a permanent war footing.  That's why I've imposed prudent limits on the use of drones -- for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.  That's why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs -- because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated.  And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay -- because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world.

You see, in a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power -- including strong and principled diplomacy.  American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles.  American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria's chemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve -- a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear. As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel -- a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side.

And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran's nuclear program -- and rolled parts of that program back -- for the very first time in a decade.  As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.  It is not installing advanced centrifuges.  Unprecedented inspections help the world verify, every day, that Iran is not building a bomb.  And with our allies and partners, we're engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

These negotiations will be difficult.  They may not succeed.  We are clear-eyed about Iran's support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away.  But these negotiations do not rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.  If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today.

The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible.  But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.  For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.  If Iran's leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon.  But if Iran's leaders do seize the chance, then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war.

Finally, let's remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe -- to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want.  And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America. 

Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.  From Tunisia to Burma, we're supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy.  In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully, and have a say in their country's future.  Across Africa, we're bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty.  In the Americas, we are building new ties of commerce, but we're also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people.  And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster -- as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, ""We will never forget your kindness"" and ""God bless America!""

We do these things because they help promote our long-term security.  And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation.

And next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment -- when Team USA marches the red, white, and blue into the Olympic Stadium -- and brings home the gold.

My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do.  On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might -- but because of the ideals we stand for, and the burdens we bear to advance them.

No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform.  As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life.  We'll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they've earned, and our wounded warriors receive the health care -- including the mental health care -- that they need.  We'll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home.  And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.

Let me tell you about one of those families I've come to know.

I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-Day.  Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program -- a strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack.  We joked around, and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch.

A few months later, on his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain. 

For months, he lay in a coma.  The next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn't speak; he could barely move.  Over the years, he's endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab every day. 

Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye.  He still struggles on his left side.  But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. Day by day, he's learned to speak again and stand again and walk again -- and he's working toward the day when he can serve his country again. 

""My recovery has not been easy,"" he says. ""Nothing in life that's worth anything is easy."" 

Cory is here tonight.  And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit.

My fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy.  Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.  Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.  But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress -- to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice, and fairness, and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen.  The America we want for our kids -- a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us -- none of it is easy.  But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow -- I know it's within our reach. 

Believe it.

God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama, seeking to restore confidence in his leadership, declared in his State of the Union address Tuesday that he would use executive power to try to narrow the gap between rich and poor and speed the nation's economic recovery.

Mr. Obama's speech was essentially a manifesto designed to inject new vigor into his languishing agenda and guide his presidency through the partisan divide in the capital. The goal was to position the president as the champion of struggling Americans fed up with the bickering in Washington, marshaling an array of policy proposals aimed at helping them save more, earn more and find work in a tough economy.

""Corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better. But average wages have barely budged,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. . . Our job is to reverse these trends.""

The president told the joint session of Congress that ""I'm eager to work with all of you,"" but his message was clear: ""Wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do.""

In vowing to act unilaterally, Mr. Obama was implicitly pointing to the limits of his ability to enact policy: Executive orders tend to have less reach and less permanence than legislation. Mr. Obama laid out a long list of proposals that would require congressional approval, including raising the minimum wage and changing the immigration system. But getting lawmakers to go along likely would be difficult.

Republican lawmakers warned of presidential overreach and cast Mr. Obama as having given up on trying to compromise with Congress. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) said Mr. Obama ""ought to work with us on bipartisan measures,"" such as making changes to the 2010 health-care law and approving the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline. ""Instead, he's talking about taking unilateral action on a whole range of things.""

Mr. Obama said Tuesday that he would sign an executive order in the coming weeks to raise the federal minimum wage for employees on new federal contracts, a move that would affect a fraction of low-wage workersjanitors and laundry workers on military bases, among others, the White House said. In a second action independent of Congress, he said he would create a new retirement-savings program coordinated by the government, a further bid to appeal to Americans' persistent sense of economic insecurity.

At the same time, he acknowledged he can't achieve certain goals alone and called on lawmakers to push through various proposals that have stalled in Congress. He urged the House and Senate to send him an overhaul of the immigration system, raise and expand the earned income tax credit for low-wage workers without children, and raise the federal minimum wage for all eligible workers to $10.10 an hour, up from $7.25.

""Opportunity is who we are,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And the defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise.""

The majority of the speech focused on domestic affairs, but Mr. Obama touched briefly on foreign policy. He indicated the U.S. ultimately would like to leave troops in Afghanistan after 2014, assuming an impasse in negotiations with the Afghan government can be resolved.

He also highlighted his administration's diplomatic efforts with Iran, saying that an agreement to curtail Tehran's nuclear program ""may not succeed"" but threatening to veto any of the legislation in Congress that would enact additional sanctions.

Mr. Obama renewed his call for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and asked Congress to do away with barriers on moving detainees out of Guantanamo so that the U.S. can shutter the prison this year.

The president asked lawmakers to tackle a number of his priorities. He called on lawmakers to overhaul the tax code and use the savings to fund infrastructure projects -- a proposal he has made before that has gained little traction -- and he pressed the House and Senate to pass trade pacts that some members of his own Democratic Party oppose.

Mr. Obama's speech touched on issues that have divided the two parties. He declared ""climate change is a fact"" after saying he would act alone to increase fuel-efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks this year.

He also tried to show how his health-care overhaul has been successful, after a botched rollout that has heightened the country's doubts about the law. At the same time, he challenged Republicans to do more than complain. ""If you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, increase choice, tell America what you'd do differently,"" he said. ""But let's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of Americans.""

The new retirement accounts would provide a guaranteed return, White House officials said. Eventually, people could convert them into traditional retirement-savings vehicles such as a 401(k) or an individual retirement account.

Mr. Obama's executive order on the minimum wage for employees of federal contractors is an attempt to lead the way as he presses employers to act voluntarily to lift minimum pay for their workers. It also is an opening salvo on an issue that Democrats plan to highlight in midterm elections.

Many Republicans oppose a minimum-wage increase, saying it would prompt employers to cut back on hiring, hurting low-wage workers. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said that when minimum-wage legislation comes to the Senate floor in the coming weeks, Republicans would offer alternatives that they believe would do more to create jobs.

An objective of the speech was to show that Mr. Obama isn't simply a player on the Washington scene but rather a president with a broad vision and independence from a Congress that polls show to be unpopular. It also was part of an effort by Mr. Obama to regain traction amid low job-approval ratings and pessimism about his abilities.

Many Democrats praised Mr. Obama's speech""a practical agenda with specific ideas,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia -- but Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said he was concerned by the president's plans to bypass Congress, if necessary. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) said she was disappointed that Mr. Obama didn't call for major changes to limit the surveillance of Americans' phone records, while Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) said she would have welcomed support for Keystone XL or ""finding a viable path forward for coal.""

John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable trade group, said there were plenty of proposals in the speech that corporations could rally behind, such as changes to immigration law, trade authority, and tax-code changes. But he said it remains to be seen whether policy makers can bridge differences.
","After five years of fractious political combat, President Obama declared independence from Congress on Tuesday as he vowed to tackle economic disparity with a series of limited initiatives on jobs, wages and retirement that he will enact without legislative approval.

Promising ""a year of action"" as he tries to rejuvenate a presidency mired in low approval ratings and stymied by partisan stalemates, Mr. Obama used his annual State of the Union address to chart a new path forward relying on his own executive authority. But the defiant ""with or without Congress"" approach was more assertive than any of the individual policies he advanced.

""I'm eager to work with all of you,"" a confident Mr. Obama told lawmakers of both parties in the 65-minute nationally televised speech in the House chamber. ""But America does not stand still -- and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do.""

The president's appearance at the Capitol, with all the traditional pomp and anticipation punctuated by partisan standing ovations, came at a critical juncture as Mr. Obama seeks to define his remaining time in office. He touched on foreign policy, asserting that ""American diplomacy backed by the threat of force"" had forced Syria to give up chemical weapons and that ""American diplomacy backed by pressure"" had brought Iran to the negotiating table. And he repeated his plan to pull troops out of Afghanistan this year and threatened again to veto sanctions on Iran that disrupt his diplomatic efforts.

The most emotional point of the evening came with the introduction of Sgt. First Class Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger the president had met both before and after he was ravaged by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. As Sergeant Remsburg, blind in one eye and having to learn to walk again, made it to his feet in the first lady's box, lawmakers of both parties gave him an extended ovation.

But Mr. Obama's message centered on the wide gap between the wealthiest and other Americans as he positioned himself as a champion of those left behind in the modern economy. ""Those at the top have never done better,"" he said. ""But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled.

""The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by, let alone to get ahead,"" he added. ""And too many still aren't working at all. So our job is to reverse these trends.""

To do so, the president announced an executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for future federal contract workers and the creation of a new Treasury savings bond for workers without access to traditional retirement options. He proposed incentives for trucks running on alternative fuels and higher efficiency standards for those running on gasoline. And he announced a meeting on working families and a review of federal job training programs.

Mr. Obama was gambling that a series of ideas that seem small-bore on their own will add up to a larger collective vision of an America with expanded opportunity. But the moderate ambitions were a stark contrast to past years when Mr. Obama proposed sweeping legislation to remake the nation's health care system, regulate Wall Street, curb climate change and restrict access to high-powered firearms.

Republicans responded by blaming Mr. Obama for the country's economic problems, but the party's leaders avoided the language of last year's government shutdown and hoped to present what Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington called ""a more hopeful, Republican vision"" intended to appeal particularly to women in a midterm election year.

In her party's official response, Ms. Rodgers offered a folksy, personal presentation, describing in moving terms her 6-year-old son, Cole, who was born with Down syndrome, even as she assailed Mr. Obama's health care program, spending record and regulations. ""Too many people are falling further and further behind because, right now, the president's policies are making people's lives harder,"" she said. ""Republicans have plans to close the gap.""

But in a sign of the continued divisions within the Republican Party, some of its conservative leaders offered separate responses. Senator Mike Lee of Utah delivered a speech on behalf of Tea Party activists, and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky distributed his own remarks on Facebook, YouTube and other social media.

Mr. Lee echoed his party message by criticizing Mr. Obama's policies, declaring that ""Obamacare, all by itself, is an inequality Godzilla."" But he also noted, ""My own party has been part of the problem, too often joining the Democrats to rig our economy to benefit the well-connected at the expense of the disconnected.""

Both the president and lawmakers brought guests intended to make political points. Among the Republican guests was Willie Robertson, a star of the reality show ""Duck Dynasty,"" whose father stirred controversy by condemning ""homosexual offenders.""

Other guests in the first lady's box with Michelle Obama were Americans who have benefited from the president's health care program and, in a jab at Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, Gov. Steve Beshear, who has energetically carried out the program in their home state, Kentucky.

The response of members at points in the speech may have offered signals of the year to come. When Mr. Obama urged Congress to ""fix our broken immigration system,"" Speaker John A. Boehner and other Republicans applauded, foreshadowing an effort to find a bipartisan compromise. When Mr. Obama boasted that he had ""rolled parts of"" Iran's nuclear program back, there was no applause, amid bipartisan skepticism of diplomacy with Tehran.

Despite his vow to move ahead without Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama said he was not giving up on Congress altogether and recycled calls for many past legislative priorities, like extending unemployment insurance. ""Let's see where else we can make progress together,"" he said.

He said ""this needs to be the year"" that lawmakers clear the way to closing the prison at GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba. He called for an across-the-board increase in the minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25. ""Say yes,"" he urged. ""Give America a raise."" He called for expanding the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers without children.

And he offered a vigorous defense of his embattled health care program. ""Let's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping Americans,"" he said.

But after a year in which most of his legislative priorities, like gun control, went nowhere, Mr. Obama has made it clear that he has restrained expectations about his ability to compromise with Republicans in the House. Mr. Obama's minimum wage plan provided an example of the new approach he plans. Since he failed to push through legislation last year, he decided to issue his order covering federal contractors.

Still, the order also illustrated the limits of that approach. An increase in the minimum wage passed by Congress would mean a raise for 17 million Americans. Mr. Obama's executive order, by contrast, will affect relatively few workers at first because it will apply only to new or renewed contracts. Eventually it might affect several hundred thousand workers at most, according to some estimates.

By the numbers, Mr. Obama has so far been restrained in his use of executive power. He has signed just 168 executive orders, and the 147 he issued in his first term were the fewest of any president over a similar period going back at least a century. In their first terms, George W. Bush signed 173 executive orders, Bill Clinton 200 and Ronald Reagan 213.

But the numbers matter less than the scope of the ones that are signed. Mr. Obama has unilaterally deferred deportation of younger illegal immigrants, delayed enforcement of his health care law and declined to defend legal challenges against the Defense of Marriage Act, a law barring federal recognition of same-sex marriages.

Perhaps the most far-reaching are regulations being developed to limit carbon emissions at the nation's power plants.

66,66,2014-03-07-RussiaUkraine.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody. Before Jay takes some of your questions, I wanted to provide a brief update on our efforts to address the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.

Since the Russian intervention, we've been mobilizing the international community to condemn this violation of international law and to support the people and Government of Ukraine. This morning I signed an Executive order that authorizes sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine or for stealing the assets of the Ukrainian people.

According to my guidance, the State Department has also put in place restrictions on the travel of certain individuals and officials. These decisions continue our efforts to impose a cost on Russia and those responsible for the situation in Crimea. And they also give us the flexibility to adjust our response going forward based on Russia's actions.

We took these steps in close coordination with our European allies. I've spoken to several of our closest friends around the world, and I'm pleased that our international unity is on display at this important moment. Already, we've moved together to announce substantial assistance for the Government in Kiev, and today in Brussels, our allies took similar steps to impose costs on Russia. I am confident that we are moving forward together, united in our determination to oppose actions that violate international law and to support the Government and people of Ukraine.

And that includes standing up for the principle of state sovereignty. The proposed referendum on the future of Crimea would violate the Ukrainian Constitution and violate international law. Any discussion about the future of Ukraine must include the legitimate Government of Ukraine. In 2014, we are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of democratic leaders.

While we take these steps, I want to be clear that there is also a way to resolve this crisis that respects the interests of the Russian Federation, as well as the Ukrainian people. Let international monitors into all of Ukraine, including Crimea, to ensure the rights of all Ukrainians are being respected, including ethnic Russians. Begin consultations between the Government of Russia and Ukraine, with the participation of the international community. Russia would maintain its basing rights in Crimea, provided that it abides by its agreements and respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. And the world should support the people of Ukraine as they move to elections in May.

That's the path of deescalation, and Secretary Kerry is engaged in discussions with all of the relevant parties, including Russia and Ukraine, to pursue that path. But if this violation of international law continues, the resolve of the United States and our allies and the international community will remain firm. Meanwhile, we've taken steps to reaffirm our commitment to the security and democracy of our allies in Eastern Europe and to support the people of Ukraine.

One last point: There's been a lot of talk in Congress about these issues. Today, once again, I'm calling on Congress to follow up on these words with action, specifically to support the IMF's capacity to lend resources to Ukraine and to provide American assistance for the Ukrainian Government so that they can weather this storm and stabilize their economy, make needed reforms, deliver for their people, all of which will provide a smoother pathway for the elections that have already been scheduled in May.

Today the world can see that the United States is united with our allies and partners in upholding international law and pursuing a just outcome that advances global security and the future that the Ukrainian people deserve. That's what we're going to continue to do in the days to come until we have seen a resolution to this crisis.

Thanks very much. And Jay and Ben and others will be happy to take your questions.

","President Vladimir Putin moved to pull Ukraine back from the brink of breakup Wednesday, calling on separatists to put off a secession vote, softening his attacks on a presidential election and saying his troops had withdrawn from the border.

Mr. Putin's change of tone came after weeks of escalation in the crisis over Ukraine, which has taken dozens of lives and brought East-West relations to their lowest point since the Cold War.

But Washington was dismissive and immediately questioned whether Moscow was genuinely committed to stabilizing Ukraine, where the government in Kiev is strongly pro-Western.

The Pentagon said it had seen no evidence to back Mr. Putin's claim that he had called back the tens of thousands of troops deployed to Ukraine's border last month.

The Obama administration noted Mr. Putin failed to call on the pro-Russian separatists to lay down their arms or vacate buildings they have commandeered in eastern Ukraine in the run-up to the referendum they plan to hold on Sunday.

Kiev and the West say such a vote would be illegal and should be canceled outright.

Mr. Putin, however, said after talks in the Kremlin with Swiss President Didier Burkhalter, who also is chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that their approaches ""coincide to a large extent.""

The outlines of the OSCE plan appear to include longtime Russian demands: that Kiev end its military operation and that the rebel leaders, whom Kiev denounces as terrorists, be given a prominent role in talks over a political settlement.

""Direct dialogue between the Kiev government and the representatives of southeast Ukraine is the crucial element for a resolution,"" Mr. Putin said.

Mr. Putin's appeal to the separatists to delay the referendum is the first time he has publicly called on them to do anything to reduce tensions. Separatist leaders reacted with dismay, with some calling it a betrayal, and said they would formulate their response Thursday.

But the referendum was facing increasingly uncertain prospects, failing to generate a groundswell of popular support.

Ukraine's military and police operation also has limited the ability of the separatists to consolidate their grip. Ukraine's intelligence service has said that in intercepted telephone conversations, rebels sound increasingly desperate for help from Russia to fight off the Ukrainian offensive.

Even some separatist leaders admitted that their initiative was looking hopeless.

Kirill Rudenko, a spokesman for the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, said that while he wasn't reflecting the group's official position, he found it difficult to imagine how they could hold a referendum in the midst of Kiev's military campaign.

""In such circumstances, it won't be possible,"" he said.

Mr. Burkhalter said the OSCE would soon distribute a proposed ""road map"" for easing tensions in Ukraine, including a cease-fire, political dialogue and elections, and hold consultations in Kiev and Washington in the next few days.

Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk reiterated that it considered any referendum on secession illegal, and that negotiations with terrorists would be ""impermissible and inconceivable.""

Past diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis have failed, most notably a pact reached in Geneva last month among Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the U.S. But they have served to buy time for Moscow and its allies in Ukraine to undermine Kiev's control over the country.

Russia also has sent conflicting signals on rescuing Ukraine's cash-strapped economy, dramatically raising the bill for natural gas while supporting a $17 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund.

The first installment of IMF loans arrived in Kiev on Wednesday, much of which is expected to go to pay debts owed to Gazprom, the Russian gas supplier.

The May 25 presidential vote is seen as vital for national reconciliation after former President Viktor Yanukovych, a Donetsk-area native and Kremlin ally, was toppled by pro-Western protesters in February.

Previously, Kremlin officials had dismissed the idea of conducting a presidential election amid the current tensions as absurd. But Mr. Putin seemed to soften Moscow's position.

He said new elections were ""movement in the right direction, but they won't resolve anything if all the citizens of Ukraine don't understand that their rights will be guaranteed"" afterward.

President Barack Obama has threatened to ramp up U.S. sanctions dramatically if Moscow disrupts the election.

European governments agreed Wednesday on a modest widening of their sanctions list in the coming days, according to diplomats in Brussels.

But a proposal that would have made it much easier for the bloc to target Russian firms has been put aside for now, they said.

One analyst said the increasing violence in the region probably had more to do with the change of rhetoric than Western sanctions.

""Given how [Mr. Putin] postured himself, as violence increases he comes under greater pressure to send in the troops,"" said Thomas Graham, a former Russia specialist at the U.S. National Security Council who is now senior director at Kissinger Associates Inc.

He added that the Kremlin seems to recognize that any military campaign in eastern Ukraine wouldn't be as bloodless as its takeover of Crimea, so Mr. Putin had to ""find a way to de-escalate without looking like he is caving.""

Senior U.S. officials said the Russian leader's latest comments were helpful, but that Washington still believed that the Kremlin was working to undermine the May 25 elections.

""There are still efforts under way to hinder the preparations,"" State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said. ""There is far more that President Putin and the Russians can do to de-escalate the situation and to ensure safe elections.""

The U.S. also said it had seen no change in Russian troop deployment.

""In order to believe President Putin's remarks that they are withdrawing troops from Ukraine's border we would actually have to see Russian troops withdraw,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said.

Mr. Putin's comments came as Kiev freed one of the pro-Russian movement's top leaders and two other jailed separatists in exchange for three Ukrainian intelligence officers the rebels had been holding in Slovyansk, the city at the heart of the insurgency, since late April.

Mr. Putin welcomed the release of Pavel Gubarev and said ""all other political prisoners"" should be released too.

Ukraine's State Security Service said the armed forces had incurred 14 dead and 66 wounded so far in its operation to oust the pro-Russian militants.

There is no official count of losses among the separatists, though officials have said dozens have been killed.

Interfax quoted separatists as saying they were fighting on the outskirts of Slovyansk, attempting to retake road checkpoints and a television tower that had been taken by Ukrainian forces earlier in the week.

Ukrainian authorities didn't comment on the fighting. Officials said earlier that they were seeking to contain the separatist forces in Slovyansk, while trying to avoid civilian casualties.


","The volatile confrontation over the future of Ukraine took another tense turn on Thursday as Russian allies in Crimea sought annexation by Moscow and the United States imposed its first sanctions on Russian officials involved in the military occupation of the strategic peninsula.

While diplomats raced from meeting to meeting in an effort to end the standoff, European leaders signaled they might join American sanctions and Moscow threatened countermeasures as an already jittery situation was made edgier by the opening of new Russian military drills.

The pro-Russia regional Parliament in Crimea crossed another line set by the United States and Europe by voting to hold a referendum on whether to secede from Ukraine and become part of Russia. It scheduled the vote for March 16, hoping to win popular approval for the Russian military seizure of the region. But the authorities in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, backed by the United States and Europe, denounced the move.

Hours after issuing his first punitive actions against specific Russians, President Obama reached out to President Vladimir V. Putin in an hourlong telephone call emphasizing a diplomatic settlement. Mr. Obama urged Mr. Putin to authorize direct talks with Ukraine's new pro-Western government, permit the entry of international monitors and return his forces here to their bases, according to the White House.

""Any discussion about the future of Ukraine must include the legitimate government of Ukraine,"" Mr. Obama said in his only public remarks on the crisis on Thursday. ""In 2014, we are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of democratic leaders.""

Early Friday, the Kremlin released a statement describing the phone call. ""In the course of the discussion there emerged differences in approaches and assessments of the causes which brought about the current crisis and the resulting state of affairs,"" the statement said. ""Vladimir Putin, for his part, noted that this had occurred as a result of an anticonstitutional coup which does not have a national mandate.""

It went on to say that the current Ukrainian leadership has imposed ""absolutely illegitimate decisions"" on the eastern and southeastern regions of the country. ""Russia cannot ignore appeals connected to this, calls for help, and acts appropriately, in accordance with international law,"" the statement said. Mr. Putin, the statement said, appreciated the importance of the Russian-American relationship to global security, and added that bilateral ties ""should not be sacrificed for individual -- albeit rather important -- international problems.""

European Union leaders issued a statement in Brussels calling an annexation referendum ""contrary to the Ukrainian Constitution and therefore illegal.""

The sanctions Mr. Obama approved Thursday imposed visa bans on officials and other individuals deemed responsible for undermining Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. The administration would not disclose the names or number of people penalized, but a senior official said privately that it would affect just under a dozen people, mostly Russians but some Ukrainians.

Among those targeted were political figures, policy advisers, security officials and military officers who played a direct role in the Crimean crisis, the official said. Any of them seeking to travel to the United States would be barred, and a few who currently hold American visas will have them revoked.

Mr. Obama also signed an executive order laying out a framework for tougher measures like freezing the assets of individuals and institutions. But the White House held back applying those measures while officials gathered evidence in the hope that waiting would provide some space for Russia to reverse course. The House, in the meantime, approved an economic aid package for the Kiev government and advanced its own sanctions resolution.

Moscow, however, gave no indication of backing down, suggesting that it would reciprocate with measures seizing American property in Russia. ""The U.S. has the right, and we have the right to respond to it,"" Vladimir Lukin, a Russian envoy who has worked on the Ukrainian crisis, told Interfax, a Russian news agency. ""But all that is, of course, not making me happy.""

The European Union took a step toward more serious measures by suspending talks with Moscow on a wide-ranging political-economic pact and on liberalizing visa requirements to make it easier for Russians to travel to Europe. European leaders laid out a three-stage process that, absent progress, would next move to travel bans, asset seizures and the cancellation of a planned European Union-Russia summit meeting and eventually to broader economic measures.

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has been reluctant to move quickly toward sanctions, said the European Union was looking for concrete evidence that Russia was trying to calm the situation ""in the next few days,"" but she noted that Thursday's events in Crimea made the need for action more urgent.

""We made it very clear that we are absolutely willing to achieve matters by negotiation,"" she said. ""We also say, however, that we are ready and willing, if these hopes were to be dashed and looking at what happened on Crimea, to adopt sanctions.""

The moves came as Secretary of State John Kerry met for a second day with Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on ways to defuse the crisis. A top aide said Mr. Kerry urged Mr. Lavrov to talk directly with Ukrainian leaders. ""We want to be able to have the dialogue that leads to the de-escalation,"" Mr. Kerry told reporters. ""We want to be able to continue the intense discussions with both sides in order to try to normalize and end this crisis.""

Mr. Kerry also met in Rome with counterparts from Germany, France, Italy and Britain, and expressed support for a push by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, to establish a ""contact group"" seeking a peaceful resolution of the crisis. The group would include Russia, Ukraine, Britain, France and the United States, and serve as a way to bring Moscow and Kiev to the table.

Mr. Lavrov expressed irritation at talk of sanctions and other retaliation. ""There are many one-sided, half-hysterical evaluations in the media,"" he told reporters. ""I repeated this to John Kerry, who seems to understand that it doesn't really help the flow of normal work. It's impossible to work honestly under the threat of ultimatums and sanctions.""

In Crimea, regional leaders said they were confident voters would choose Russia over Ukraine. The City Council of Sevastopol, which has separate legal status, took matching steps on Thursday to hold a similar referendum on March 16. Pro-Russia demonstrators cheered the news and regarded secession from Ukraine as a foregone conclusion.

""We're already Russian,"" Natasha Malachuk said as she picketed a local security headquarters.

Others objected, particularly the peninsula's large Crimean Tatar minority. ""It's completely illegitimate,"" said Bilal Kuzi-Emin, 25, a Tatar who works as a waiter.

A Kiev court has already ruled the Crimean Parliament's actions illegal. An arrest warrant has been issued for the new regional prime minister, Sergei Aksyonov, who was installed a week ago after armed men seized the Parliament building and raised the Russian flag.

Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr V. Turchynov, scoffed at a planned referendum under the watch of foreign troops. ""This will be a farce,"" he said in a televised address. ""This will be false. This will be a crime against the state.""

Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, said the Kremlin had been informed of the developments but offered no further comment. Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev said Russia would simplify procedures for people who have lived in Russia or the former Soviet Union to secure Russian citizenship.

If the referendum is held and most Crimeans opt to join Russia, it could create a thorny problem for the United States and European countries that typically support self-determination but oppose independence for regions in their own borders, like Scotland or Catalonia.

In Crimea, Russian and pro-Russia forces maintained a blockade of Ukrainian military facilities. At a local military office in Simferopol, they used a crane to place heavy concrete barriers to obstruct military vehicles leaving the compound. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the Russian Navy scuttled an old cruiser in a narrow channel to trap Ukrainian naval vessels in port at Novoozerne.

In Donetsk, in the east, Ukrainian police officers ordered pro-Moscow demonstrators, including Pavel Gubarev, the so-called people's governor, to leave the city's administration building. Hundreds more pro-Russia demonstrators clashed with the police outside the local headquarters of the national security service in Donetsk, blockading a police bus with parked cars and derailed trolleys and forcing the police to release detained protesters. Later on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said Mr. Gubarev had been arrested.

67,67,2014-03-26-NATOBelgium.txt," Good evening.  Goede avond.  Bonsoir.  Guten abend. Thank you, Laura, for that remarkable introduction.  Before she came out she told me not to be nervous.   And I can only imagine -- I think her father is in the audience, and I can only imagine how proud he is of her.  We're grateful for her work, but sheâs also reminding us that our future will be defined by young people like her.

Your Majesties, Mr. Prime Minister, and the people of Belgium -- on behalf of the American people, we are grateful for your friendship.  We stand together as inseparable allies, and I thank you for your wonderful hospitality.  I have to admit it is easy to love a country famous for chocolate and beer.

Leaders and dignitaries of the European Union; representatives of our NATO Alliance; distinguished guests:  We meet here at a moment of testing for Europe and the United States, and for the international order that we have worked for generations to build.

Throughout human history, societies have grappled with fundamental questions of how to organize themselves, the proper relationship between the individual and the state, the best means to resolve inevitable conflicts between states.  And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle -- through war and Enlightenment, repression and revolution -- that a particular set of ideals began to emerge:  The belief that through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose.  The belief that power is derived from the consent of the governed, and that laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding.  And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men -- and women -- are created equal.

But those ideals have also been tested -- here in Europe and around the world.  Those ideals have often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power.  This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign. Often, this alternative vision roots itself in the notion that by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, some are inherently superior to others, and that individual identity must be defined by âusâ versus âthem,â or that national greatness must flow not by what a people stand for, but by what they are against.

In many ways, the history of Europe in the 20th century represented the ongoing clash of these two sets of ideas, both within nations and among nations.  The advance of industry and technology outpaced our ability to resolve our differences peacefully, and even among the most civilized of societies, on the surface we saw a descent into barbarism.

This morning at Flanders Field, I was reminded of how war between peoples sent a generation to their deaths in the trenches and gas of the First World War.  And just two decades later, extreme nationalism plunged this continent into war once again -- with populations enslaved, and great cities reduced to rubble, and tens of millions slaughtered, including those lost in the Holocaust.

It is in response to this tragic history that, in the aftermath of World War II, America joined with Europe to reject the darker forces of the past and build a new architecture of peace.  Workers and engineers gave life to the Marshall Plan. Sentinels stood vigilant in a NATO Alliance that would become the strongest the world has ever known.  And across the Atlantic, we embraced a shared vision of Europe -- a vision based on representative democracy, individual rights, and a belief that nations can meet the interests of their citizens through trade and open markets; a social safety net and respect for those of different faiths and backgrounds.

For decades, this vision stood in sharp contrast to life on the other side of an Iron Curtain.  For decades, a contest was waged, and ultimately that contest was won -- not by tanks or missiles, but because our ideals stirred the hearts of Hungarians who sparked a revolution; Poles in their shipyards who stood in Solidarity; Czechs who waged a Velvet Revolution without firing a shot; and East Berliners who marched past the guards and finally tore down that wall.

Today, what would have seemed impossible in the trenches of Flanders, the rubble of Berlin, or a dissidentâs prison cell -- that reality is taken for granted.  A Germany unified.  The nations of Central and Eastern Europe welcomed into the family of democracies.  Here in this country, once the battleground of Europe, we meet in the hub of a Union that brings together age-old adversaries in peace and cooperation.  The people of Europe, hundreds of millions of citizens -- east, west, north, south -- are more secure and more prosperous because we stood together for the ideals we share.

And this story of human progress was by no means limited to Europe.  Indeed, the ideals that came to define our alliance also inspired movements across the globe among those very people, ironically, who had too often been denied their full rights by Western powers.  After the Second World War, people from Africa to India threw off the yoke of colonialism to secure their independence.  In the United States, citizens took freedom rides and endured beatings to put an end to segregation and to secure their civil rights.  As the Iron Curtain fell here in Europe, the iron fist of apartheid was unclenched, and Nelson Mandela emerged upright, proud, from prison to lead a multiracial democracy.  Latin American nations rejected dictatorship and built new democracies, and Asian nations showed that development and democracy could go hand in hand.

Young people in the audience today, young people like Laura, were born in a place and a time where there is less conflict, more prosperity and more freedom than any time in human history. But thatâs not because manâs darkest impulses have vanished.  Even here, in Europe, weâve seen ethnic cleansing in the Balkans that shocked the conscience.

The difficulties of integration and globalization, recently amplified by the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, strained the European project and stirred the rise of a politics that too often targets immigrants or gays or those who seem somehow different. 

While technology has opened up vast opportunities for trade and innovation and cultural understanding, itâs also allowed terrorists to kill on a horrifying scale.  Around the world, sectarian warfare and ethnic conflicts continue to claim thousands of lives.  And once again, we are confronted with the belief among some that bigger nations can bully smaller ones to get their way -- that recycled maxim that might somehow makes right.

So I come here today to insist that we must never take for granted the progress that has been won here in Europe and advanced around the world, because the contest of ideas continues for your generation.  And thatâs whatâs at stake in Ukraine today.  Russiaâs leadership is challenging truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident -- that in the 21st century, the borders of Europe cannot be redrawn with force, that international law matters, that people and nations can make their own decisions about their future.

To be honest, if we defined our interests narrowly, if we applied a cold-hearted calculus, we might decide to look the other way.  Our economy is not deeply integrated with Ukraineâs. Our people and our homeland face no direct threat from the invasion of Crimea.  Our own borders are not threatened by Russiaâs annexation.  But that kind of casual indifference would ignore the lessons that are written in the cemeteries of this continent.  It would allow the old way of doing things to regain a foothold in this young century.  And that message would be heard not just in Europe, but in Asia and the Americas, in Africa and the Middle East. 

And the consequences that would arise from complacency are not abstractions.  The impact that they have on the lives of real people -- men and women just like us -- have to enter into our imaginations.  Just look at the young people of Ukraine who were determined to take back their future from a government rotted by corruption -- the portraits of the fallen shot by snipers, the visitors who pay their respects at the Maidan.  There was the university student, wrapped in the Ukrainian flag, expressing her hope that âevery country should live by the law.â  A postgraduate student, speaking of her fellow protestors, saying, âI want these people who are here to have dignity.â  Imagine that you are the young woman who said, âthere are some things that fear, police sticks and tear gas cannot destroy.â

Weâve never met these people, but we know them.  Their voices echo calls for human dignity that rang out in European streets and squares for generations.  Their voices echo those around the world who at this very moment fight for their dignity. These Ukrainians rejected a government that was stealing from the people instead of serving them, and are reaching for the same ideals that allow us to be here today.

None of us can know for certain what the coming days will bring in Ukraine, but I am confident that eventually those voices -- those voices for human dignity and opportunity and individual rights and rule of law -- those voices ultimately will triumph.  I believe that over the long haul, as nations that are free, as free people, the future is ours.  I believe this not because Iâm naÃ¯ve, and I believe this not because of the strength of our arms or the size of our economies, I believe this because these ideals that we affirm are true; these ideals are universal.

Yes, we believe in democracy -- with elections that are free and fair; and independent judiciaries and opposition parties; civil society and uncensored information so that individuals can make their own choices.  Yes, we believe in open economies based on free markets and innovation, and individual initiative and entrepreneurship, and trade and investment that creates a broader prosperity.  And, yes, we believe in human dignity -- that every person is created equal, no matter who you are, or what you look like, or who you love, or where you come from.  That is what we believe.  Thatâs what makes us strong.

And our enduring strength is also reflected in our respect for an international system that protects the rights of both nations and people -- a United Nations and a Universal Declaration of Human Rights; international law and the means to enforce those laws.  But we also know that those rules are not self-executing; they depend on people and nations of goodwill continually affirming them.  And thatâs why Russiaâs violation of international law -- its assault on Ukraineâs sovereignty and territorial integrity -- must be met with condemnation.  Not because weâre trying to keep Russia down, but because the principles that have meant so much to Europe and the world must be lifted up. 

Over the last several days, the United States, Europe, and our partners around the world have been united in defense of these ideals, and united in support of the Ukrainian people. Together, weâve condemned Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, and rejected the legitimacy of the Crimean referendum.  Together, we have isolated Russia politically, suspending it from the G8 nations and downgrading our bilateral ties.  Together, we are imposing costs through sanctions that have left a mark on Russia and those accountable for its actions.  And if the Russian leadership stays on its current course, together we will ensure that this isolation deepens.  Sanctions will expand.  And the toll on Russiaâs economy, as well as its standing in the world, will only increase.

And meanwhile, the United States and our allies will continue to support the government of Ukraine as they chart a democratic course.  Together, we are going to provide a significant package of assistance that can help stabilize the Ukrainian economy, and meet the basic needs of the people.  Make no mistake:  Neither the United States, nor Europe has any interest in controlling Ukraine.  We have sent no troops there.  What we want is for the Ukrainian people to make their own decisions, just like other free people around the world.

Understand, as well, this is not another Cold War that weâre entering into.  After all, unlike the Soviet Union, Russia leads no bloc of nations, no global ideology.  The United States and NATO do not seek any conflict with Russia.  In fact, for more than 60 years, we have come together in NATO -- not to claim other lands, but to keep nations free.  What we will do -- always -- is uphold our solemn obligation, our Article 5 duty to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our allies.  And in that promise we will never waver; NATO nations never stand alone.

Today, NATO planes patrol the skies over the Baltics, and weâve reinforced our presence in Poland.  And weâre prepared to do more.  Going forward, every NATO member state must step up and carry its share of the burden by showing the political will to invest in our collective defense, and by developing the capabilities to serve as a source of international peace and security.

Of course, Ukraine is not a member of NATO -- in part because of its close and complex history with Russia.  Nor will Russia be dislodged from Crimea or deterred from further escalation by military force.  But with time, so long as we remain united, the Russian people will recognize that they cannot achieve security, prosperity and the status that they seek through brute force.  And thatâs why, throughout this crisis, we will combine our substantial pressure on Russia with an open door for diplomacy.  I believe that for both Ukraine and Russia, a stable peace will come through de-escalation -- direct dialogue between Russia and the government of Ukraine and the international community; monitors who can ensure that the rights of all Ukrainians are protected; a process of constitutional reform within Ukraine; and free and fair elections this spring.

So far, Russia has resisted diplomatic overtures, annexing Crimea and massing large forces along Ukraineâs border.  Russia has justified these actions as an effort to prevent problems on its own borders and to protect ethnic Russians inside Ukraine.  Of course, there is no evidence, and never has been, of systemic violence against ethnic Russians inside of Ukraine.  Moreover, many countries around the world face similar questions about their borders and ethnic minorities abroad, about sovereignty and self-determination.  These are tensions that have led in other places to debate and democratic referendums, conflicts and uneasy co-existence.  These are difficult issues, and it is precisely because these questions are hard that they must be addressed through constitutional means and international laws so that majorities cannot simply suppress minorities, and big countries cannot simply bully the small.

In defending its actions, Russian leaders have further claimed Kosovo as a precedent -- an example they say of the West interfering in the affairs of a smaller country, just as theyâre doing now.  But NATO only intervened after the people of Kosovo were systematically brutalized and killed for years.  And Kosovo only left Serbia after a referendum was organized not outside the boundaries of international law, but in careful cooperation with the United Nations and with Kosovoâs neighbors.  None of that even came close to happening in Crimea.

Moreover, Russia has pointed to Americaâs decision to go into Iraq as an example of Western hypocrisy.  Now, it is true that the Iraq War was a subject of vigorous debate not just around the world, but in the United States as well.  I participated in that debate and I opposed our military intervention there.  But even in Iraq, America sought to work within the international system.  We did not claim or annex Iraqâs territory.  We did not grab its resources for our own gain.  Instead, we ended our war and left Iraq to its people and a fully sovereign Iraqi state that could make decisions about its own future.

Of course, neither the United States nor Europe are perfect in adherence to our ideals, nor do we claim to be the sole arbiter of what is right or wrong in the world.  We are human, after all, and we face difficult choices about how to exercise our power.  But part of what makes us different is that we welcome criticism, just as we welcome the responsibilities that come with global leadership. 

We look to the East and the South and see nations poised to play a growing role on the world stage, and we consider that a good thing.  It reflects the same diversity that makes us stronger as a nation and the forces of integration and cooperation that Europe has advanced for decades.  And in a world of challenges that are increasingly global, all of us have an interest in nations stepping forward to play their part -- to bear their share of the burden and to uphold international norms.

So our approach stands in stark contrast to the arguments coming out of Russia these days.  It is absurd to suggest -- as a steady drumbeat of Russian voices do -- that America is somehow conspiring with fascists inside of Ukraine or failing to respect the Russian people.  My grandfather served in Pattonâs Army, just as many of your fathers and grandfathers fought against fascism. We Americans remember well the unimaginable sacrifices made by the Russian people in World War II, and we have honored those sacrifices.

Since the end of the Cold War, we have worked with Russia under successive administrations to build ties of culture and commerce and international community not as a favor to Russia, but because it was in our national interests.  And together, weâve secured nuclear materials from terrorists.  We welcomed Russia into the G8 and the World Trade Organization.  From the reduction of nuclear arms to the elimination of Syriaâs chemical weapons, we believe the world has benefited when Russia chooses to cooperate on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. 

So America, and the world and Europe, has an interest in a strong and responsible Russia, not a weak one.  We want the Russian people to live in security, prosperity and dignity like everyone else -- proud of their own history.  But that does not mean that Russia can run roughshod over its neighbors.  Just because Russia has a deep history with Ukraine does not mean it should be able to dictate Ukraineâs future.  No amount of propaganda can make right something that the world knows is wrong.

In the end, every society must chart its own course. Americaâs path or Europeâs path is not the only ways to reach freedom and justice.  But on the fundamental principle that is at stake here -- the ability of nations and peoples to make their own choices -- there can be no going back.  Itâs not America that filled the Maidan with protesters -- it was Ukrainians.  No foreign forces compelled the citizens of Tunis and Tripoli to rise up -- they did so on their own.  From the Burmese parliamentarian pursuing reform to the young leaders fighting corruption and intolerance in Africa, we see something irreducible that all of us share as human beings -- a truth that will persevere in the face of violence and repression and will ultimately overcome.

For the young people here today, I know it may seem easy to see these events as removed from our lives, remote from our daily routines, distant from concerns closer to home.  I recognize that both in the United States and in much of Europe thereâs more than enough to worry about in the affairs of our own countries.  There will always be voices who say that what happens in the wider world is not our concern, nor our responsibility.  But we must never forget that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom.  Our democracy, our individual opportunity only exists because those who came before us had the wisdom and the courage to recognize that our ideals will only endure if we see our self-interest in the success of other peoples and other nations. 

Now is not the time for bluster.  The situation in Ukraine, like crises in many parts of the world, does not have easy answers nor a military solution.  But at this moment, we must meet the challenge to our ideals -- to our very international order -- with strength and conviction.

And it is you, the young people of Europe, young people like Laura, who will help decide which way the currents of our history will flow.  Do not think for a moment that your own freedom, your own prosperity, that your own moral imagination is bound by the limits of your community, your ethnicity, or even your country.  Youâre bigger than that.  You can help us to choose a better history.  Thatâs what Europe tells us.  Thatâs what the American experience is all about.

I say this as the President of a country that looked to Europe for the values that are written into our founding documents, and which spilled blood to ensure that those values could endure on these shores.  I also say this as the son of a Kenyan whose grandfather was a cook for the British, and as a person who once lived in Indonesia as it emerged from colonialism.  The ideals that unite us matter equally to the young people of Boston or Brussels, or Jakarta or Nairobi, or Krakow or Kyiv.

In the end, the success of our ideals comes down to us -- including the example of our own lives, our own societies.  We know that there will always be intolerance.  But instead of fearing the immigrant, we can welcome him.  We can insist on policies that benefit the many, not just the few; that an age of globalization and dizzying change opens the door of opportunity to the marginalized, and not just a privileged few.  Instead of targeting our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters, we can use our laws to protect their rights.  Instead of defining ourselves in opposition to others, we can affirm the aspirations that we hold in common.  Thatâs what will make America strong.  Thatâs what will make Europe strong.  Thatâs what makes us who we are.

And just as we meet our responsibilities as individuals, we must be prepared to meet them as nations.  Because we live in a world in which our ideals are going to be challenged again and again by forces that would drag us back into conflict or corruption.  We canât count on others to rise to meet those tests.  The policies of your government, the principles of your European Union, will make a critical difference in whether or not the international order that so many generations before you have strived to create continues to move forward, or whether it retreats.

And thatâs the question we all must answer -- what kind of Europe, what kind of America, what kind of world will we leave behind.  And I believe that if we hold firm to our principles, and are willing to back our beliefs with courage and resolve, then hope will ultimately overcome fear, and freedom will continue to triumph over tyranny -- because that is what forever stirs in the human heart.

Thank you very much.
","President Barack Obama, emphasizing U.S. allies' united front against Moscow, cast Russia's invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea as a violation of a European order painstakingly built from the rubble and bloodshed of World War II.

Capping off three days of intensive meetings with European leaders, Mr. Obama spent much of Wednesday telling U.S. allies that they need to ""step up"" their commitments, particularly on military security.

""Russia's leadership is challenging truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident: that in the 21st century, the borders of Europe cannot be redrawn with force,"" Mr. Obama said.

Unless the U.S. and Europe take stern action to protect these principles, he warned: ""That message would be heard not just in Europe but in Asia and the Americas, in Africa and the Middle East.""

European officials responded to the prodding by agreeing to take steps to reduce their dependence on Russian natural gas and to improve the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's security posture.

Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO's secretary-general, said the alliance will ""intensify our military cooperation with Ukraine,"" including helping modernize Ukrainian forces. ""We will review the viability of our relationship with Russia,"" he said. ""We will not seek confrontation, but we will not waver if challenged.""

In Washington, however, U.K. Defense Minister Philip Hammond acknowledged NATO members, including the U.K. and U.S., face budget constraints.

""With budget constraints a real and present factor in both countries, it is incumbent upon us to explore new areas of cooperation,"" he said.

Mr. Obama invoked the long-standing U.S.-European alliance in an address in Brussels on Wednesday and argued that the Russian intervention has repercussions that could stretch far beyond a dispute over a small peninsula in Eastern Europe.

Mr. Obama's diplomatic effort to blunt what he described as Russia's reversion to ""the old way of doing things"" has paid some dividends.

He gained tentative approval from European leaders to adopt measures targeting key sectors of the Russian economy if President Vladimir Putin makes further military moves.

In addition, leaders of the Group of Seven leading nations, in a meeting called by Mr. Obama in the Netherlands, agreed to effectively suspend Russia from their elite international forum.

NATO said it would seek ways to beef up Eastern European security measures and the European Union and U.S. said they would pursue ways to loosen Europe's dependence on Russian energy.

The week also left unclear whether there would be additional European sanctions against Moscow for its annexation of Crimea.

Mr. Obama warned in appearances Wednesday that Russia would be punished further if it continued on its ""current course.""

But European officials have said they would tighten sanctions in the event of further acts of Russian aggression.

The efforts to tighten ties between America and Europe took place against the backdrop of a continued Russian military mobilization along Ukraine's eastern border, which has U.S. and Western officials increasingly worried.

U.S. and U.K. defense officials expressed concern about the buildup at a Pentagon news conference Wednesday. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told him the Russian troops ""had no intention of crossing the border into Ukraine.""

""I told him that we looked forward to the Russians living up to their word if that was the case. But the reality is, they continue to build up their forces, so they need to make sure that they stay committed to what Minister Shoigu told me,"" Mr. Hagel said.

Mr. Hammond questioned whether the Russian forces are answering to the Russian defense chief, saying they appeared to be directed by Mr. Putin.

""All the evidence suggests that the Russian agenda is being very much run by President Putin personally, and other Russian players. . .may express views, but it's a moot point,"" he said.

A breakthrough on the crucial issue of financial support for Ukraine is possible on Thursday, when the International Monetary Fund is expected to announce a tentative bailout deal for Ukraine.

The deal is expected to be around $15 billion, part of a broader international aid package, people familiar with the negotiations said.

But the challenge of squeezing a Russian economy deeply intertwined with Europe's was underscored Wednesday by a meeting in Moscow in which the CEO of Siemens AG, Joe Kaeser, assured Mr. Putin that the German engineering giant will continue with long-term investments in Russia.

A senior administration official said the U.S. is coordinating with European allies to prepare a sanctions package that, if needed, would be diverse enough not to overwhelmingly impact one country.

""Everybody is well aware that different sectors will affect different countries and it's important to have a balance, assuming that things will deteriorate,"" the official said, adding that Mr. Obama stressed that point in his meetings this week. ""London is very dependent on its financial sector. France is more dependent on arms. Germany does a lot of engineering and trade with Russia.""

Experts on Russia challenged the Obama administration's view that Mr. Putin is becoming more isolated. Many top developing countries -- including China, Brazil, South Africa and India -- either have remained silent on the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea or have supported it. They also said a campaign against Moscow could break down on North-South grounds, rather than East-West.

""If we exclude Russia from the U.S.-EU systems, we know where they would go. They would turn toward Beijing,"" said Dimitri Simes, president of The Center for the National Interest, a Washington think tank.

Mr. Obama's discussions with European leaders will continue Thursday in meetings with the leaders of Italy.
","President Obama has spent much of his presidency mired in the challenges of a world well outside the borders of Europe -- the turmoil of the Middle East, the power struggles in Asia and the terrorist threats percolating in northern Africa, Pakistan and elsewhere.

But Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its stunningly fast annexation of Crimea have demanded a renewed focus on the part of the world that dominated American attention in the 20th century. Often accused of neglecting Europe in his first five years in office, Mr. Obama is using his trip here to recommit to the NATO alliance, rally the Continent against Russian ""brute force"" and cast the showdown as a test of common values.

To show resolve, Mr. Obama decided on Wednesday to modestly increase military deployments in Eastern Europe, and aides said he would intensify efforts to broaden energy security, negotiate a trade agreement with Europe and upgrade military capabilities.

Yet it will be hard to back up words with resources. The United States has only a small fraction of the force it once had in Europe, expanded energy ties will take years, and his own party leaders oppose quick action on a new trade pact.

Moreover, Mr. Obama next month will head back to Asia, and aides said he would again promote his policy of pivoting toward the region he believes represents the future. One goal then for Mr. Obama, aides said, is to challenge Europe to take more of a leadership role itself, a familiar theme from Washington but one infused with new urgency by the Ukraine crisis.

""Russia's leadership is challenging truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident,"" Mr. Obama said in a speech here on Wednesday. ""That in the 21st century, the borders of Europe cannot be redrawn with force; that international law matters; and that people and nations can make their own decisions about their future.""

""The contest of ideas,"" he added, ""continues.""

Julianne Smith, a former national security aide in Mr. Obama's White House now at the Center for a New American Security, said she did not expect ""a fundamental recalibration of U.S. foreign policy"" toward Europe, but a more ""symbolic"" shift. ""It's a little bit less about what the U.S. is going to do above and beyond what it's done and more about challenging Europe to stand up to the task, particularly on the defense side,"" she said.

Yet if the renewed American attention to Europe proves largely symbolic, that by itself might represent an important shift. European leaders and analysts have long complained of Mr. Obama's lack of interest.

While he came into office wildly popular in Europe and made six trips here in his first year, he stopped traveling so often in his second year and even skipped a summit meeting with the European Union, offending the hosts until it was eventually rescheduled. In 2012, as he ran for re-election, he made no trips to Europe.

His poll numbers in Europe remain higher than President George W. Bush's, but they have slipped since 2009 amid disenchantment with drone strikes and other policies. Analysts said he never forged particularly strong relationships with his European counterparts, and spying revelations soured ties even more, especially with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.

But Russia's actions in Ukraine appear to have sent an electric jolt through Mr. Obama and his team. At first, when a political crisis broke out in Kiev in November, he largely left the matter to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Since President Vladimir V. Putin ordered troops to seize Crimea, Mr. Obama has become increasingly engaged, blitzing foreign leaders with telephone calls, imposing sanctions and speaking out more frequently.

To reassure nervous allies, he sent six extra F-15C Eagles to Lithuania and 12 F-16 fighter jets to Poland. Mr. Obama, who met here with Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the NATO secretary general, will further bolster defenses in Eastern Europe by rotating more ground and naval forces for exercises and training in Poland and the Baltic countries; update contingency planning; and increase the capacity of a NATO quick-response force.

""Putin just declared war on the European order and it's demanding that the United States focus on Europe again as a security issue,"" said Damon Wilson, a former national security aide to Mr. Bush and now executive vice president of the Atlantic Council. While some Republicans have pushed the president to be tougher, Mr. Wilson praised Mr. Obama's response. ""I don't think I've seen the president more personally engaged on any foreign policy crisis in a concerted way as he has been on Ukraine.""

Mr. Obama's speech here on Wednesday offered his most extensive rejoinder yet to Russia, a point-by-point refutation of every justification offered by Moscow for its seizure of Crimea. He rejected Mr. Putin's comparison of his actions in Crimea to the West's actions in Kosovo. He said Kremlin claims of persecution of Russian speakers in Ukraine were not true and called it ""absurd"" to suggest America supported fascists in Kiev. ""No amount of propaganda can make right something that the world knows is wrong,"" he said.

Perhaps most strikingly for a Democrat who rose to prominence in part because of his opposition to the Iraq war, Mr. Obama took on and dismissed the Russian claim that the United States was hypocritical because it used force to dislodge Saddam Hussein. He reminded his audience that he spoke out against Mr. Bush's decision to invade in 2003. ""But even in Iraq, America sought to work within the international system,"" he said. ""We did not claim or annex Iraq's territory. We did not grab its resources for our own gain.""

Mr. Obama also turned away from his own rhetoric in 2012 when he mocked Mitt Romney's us-against-them assessment of Mr. Putin by suggesting it was old-world thinking at a time when history had largely moved on. Now, it was Mr. Obama who evoked history, visiting Flanders Field Cemetery, a burial ground in Belgium for 368 Americans who died in World War I, and later recounting the ""ongoing clash"" of two sets of national ideas about power and values during the Cold War.

""For decades, this vision stood in sharp contrast to life on the other side of an Iron Curtain,"" Mr. Obama said, describing democratic ideals fostered by European countries. ""For decades, a contest was waged, and ultimately that contest was won.""

In his speech, the president called for a reaffirmation of Atlantic relationships, suggesting that Europeans and Americans had become complacent since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He said that ""man's darkest impulses"" had returned to Europe and that Americans and their allies must not take the progress of the last 50 years for granted.

""Casual indifference would ignore the lessons that are written in the cemeteries of this Continent,"" Mr. Obama said. ""It would allow the old way of doing things to gain a foothold in this young century. And that message would be heard, not just in Europe but in Asia and the Americas, in Africa and the Middle East.""

68,68,2014-04-11-CivilRights.txt,"What a singular honor it is for me to be here today.  I want to thank, first and foremost, the Johnson family for giving us this opportunity and the graciousness with which Michelle and I have been received. 

We came down a little bit late because we were upstairs looking at some of the exhibits and some of the private offices that were used by President Johnson and Mrs. Johnson.  And Michelle was in particular interested to -- of a recording in which Lady Bird is critiquing President Johnsonâs performance.  And she said, come, come, you need to listen to this.  And she pressed the button and nodded her head.  Some things do not change -- even 50 years later.

To all the members of Congress, the warriors for justice, the elected officials and community leaders who are here today -- I want to thank you.

Four days into his sudden presidency -- and the night before he would address a joint session of the Congress in which he once served -- Lyndon Johnson sat around a table with his closest advisors, preparing his remarks to a shattered and grieving nation.

He wanted to call on senators and representatives to pass a civil rights bill -- the most sweeping since Reconstruction.  And most of his staff counseled him against it.  They said it was hopeless; that it would anger powerful Southern Democrats and committee chairmen; that it risked derailing the rest of his domestic agenda.  And one particularly bold aide said he did not believe a President should spend his time and power on lost causes, however worthy they might be.  To which, it is said, President Johnson replied, âWell, what the hellâs the presidency for?â1  What the hellâs the presidency for if not to fight for causes you believe in?

Today, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, we honor the men and women who made it possible.  Some of them are here today.  We celebrate giants like John Lewis and Andrew Young and Julian Bond.  We recall the countless unheralded Americans, black and white, students and scholars, preachers and housekeepers -- whose names are etched not on monuments, but in the hearts of their loved ones, and in the fabric of the country they helped to change. 

But we also gather here, deep in the heart of the state that shaped him, to recall one giant manâs remarkable efforts to make real the promise of our founding:  âWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.â

Those of us who have had the singular privilege to hold the office of the Presidency know well that progress in this country can be hard and it can be slow, frustrating and sometimes youâre stymied.  The office humbles you.  Youâre reminded daily that in this great democracy, you are but a relay swimmer in the currents of history, bound by decisions made by those who came before, reliant on the efforts of those who will follow to fully vindicate your vision.

But the presidency also affords a unique opportunity to bend those currents -- by shaping our laws and by shaping our debates; by working within the confines of the world as it is, but also by reimagining the world as it should be.

This was President Johnsonâs genius.  As a master of politics and the legislative process, he grasped like few others the power of government to bring about change. 

LBJ was nothing if not a realist.  He was well aware that the law alone isnât enough to change hearts and minds.  A full century after Lincolnâs time, he said,

    Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of menâs skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact.2

He understood laws couldnât accomplish everything.  But he also knew that only the law could anchor change, and set hearts and minds on a different course.  And a lot of Americans needed the lawâs most basic protections at that time.  As Dr. King said at the time,

    It may be true that the law canât make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think thatâs pretty important.3

And passing laws was what LBJ knew how to do.  No one knew politics and no one loved legislating more than President Johnson.  He was charming when he needed to be, ruthless when required.  He could wear you down with logic and argument.  He could horse trade, and he could flatter. You come with me on this bill,â he would reportedly tell a key Republican leader from my home state during the fight for the Civil Rights Bill, âand 200 years from now, schoolchildren will know only two names: Abraham Lincoln and Everett Dirksen And he knew that senators would believe things like that.

President Johnson liked power.  He liked the feel of it, the wielding of it.  But that hunger was harnessed and redeemed by a deeper understanding of the human condition; by a sympathy for the underdog, for the downtrodden, for the outcast.  And it was a sympathy rooted in his own experience.

As a young boy growing up in the Texas Hill Country, Johnson knew what being poor felt like.  âPoverty was so common,â he would later say, âwe didnât even know it had a name.â  The family home didnât have electricity or indoor plumbing.  Everybody worked hard, including the children.  President Johnson had known the metallic taste of hunger; the feel of a motherâs calloused hands, rubbed raw from washing and cleaning and holding a household together.  His cousin Ava remembered sweltering days spent on her hands and knees in the cotton fields, with Lyndon whispering beside her, âBoy, thereâs got to be a better way to make a living than this.  Thereâs got to be a better way.â4

It wasnât until years later when he was teaching at a so-called Mexican school in a tiny town in Texas that he came to understand how much worse the persistent pain of poverty could be for other races in a Jim Crow South.  Oftentimes his students would show up to class hungry.  And when heâd visit their homes, heâd meet fathers who were paid slave wages by the farmers they worked for.  Those children were taught, he would later say, âthat the end of life is in a beet row, a spinach field, or a cotton patch.â 

Deprivation and discrimination -- these were not abstractions to Lyndon Baines Johnson.  He knew that poverty and injustice are as inseparable as opportunity and justice are joined.  So that was in him from an early age.

Now, like any of us, he was not a perfect man.  His experiences in rural Texas may have stretched his moral imagination, but he was ambitious, very ambitious, a young man in a hurry to plot his own escape from poverty and to chart his own political career.  And in the Jim Crow South, that meant not challenging convention.  During his first 20 years in Congress, he opposed every civil rights bill that came up for a vote, once calling the push for federal legislation âa farce and a sham.â  He was chosen as a vice presidential nominee in part because of his affinity with, and ability to deliver, that Southern white vote.  And at the beginning of the Kennedy administration, he shared with President Kennedy a caution towards racial controversy. 

But marchers kept marching.  Four little girls were killed in a church.  Bloody Sunday happened.  The winds of change blew.  And when the time came, when LBJ stood in the Oval Office -- I picture him standing there, taking up the entire doorframe, looking out over the South Lawn in a quiet moment -- and asked himself what the true purpose of his office was for, what was the endpoint of his ambitions, he would reach back in his own memory and heâd remember his own experience with want. 

And he knew that he had a unique capacity, as the most powerful white politician from the South, to not merely challenge the convention that had crushed the dreams of so many, but to ultimately dismantle for good the structures of legal segregation.  Heâs the only guy who could do it -- and he knew there would be a cost, famously saying the Democratic Party may âhave lost the South for a generation.â5 

Thatâs what his presidency was for.  Thatâs where he meets his moment.  And possessed with an iron will, possessed with those skills that he had honed so many years in Congress, pushed and supported by a movement of those willing to sacrifice everything for their own liberation, President Johnson fought for and argued and horse traded and bullied and persuaded until ultimately he signed the Civil Rights Act into law. 

And he didnât stop there -- even though his advisors again told him to wait, again told him let the dust settle, let the country absorb this momentous decision.  He shook them off.  âThe meat in the coconut,â as President Johnson would put it, was the Voting Rights Act, so he fought for and passed that as well.  Immigration reform came shortly after.  And then, a Fair Housing Act.  And then, a health care law that opponents described as âsocialized medicineâ that would curtail Americaâs freedom, but ultimately freed millions of seniors from the fear that illness could rob them of dignity and security in their golden years, which we now know today as Medicare.

What President Johnson understood was that equality required more than the absence of oppression.  It required the presence of economic opportunity.  He wouldnât be as eloquent as Dr. King would be in describing that linkage, as Dr. King moved into mobilizing sanitation workers and a poor peopleâs movement, but he understood that connection because he had lived it.  A decent job, decent wages, health care -- those, too, were civil rights worth fighting for.  An economy where hard work is rewarded and success is shared, that was his goal.  And he knew, as someone who had seen the New Deal transform the landscape of his Texas childhood, who had seen the difference electricity had made because of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the transformation concretely day in and day out in the life of his own family, he understood that government had a role to play in broadening prosperity to all those who would strive for it.

âWe want to open the gates to opportunity,â President Johnson said, âBut we are also going to give all our people, black and white, the help they need to walk through those gates.â6

Now, if some of this sounds familiar, itâs because today we remain locked in this same great debate about equality and opportunity, and the role of government in ensuring each.  As was true 50 years ago, there are those who dismiss the Great Society as a failed experiment and an encroachment on liberty; who argue that government has become the true source of all that ails us, and that poverty is due to the moral failings of those who suffer from it.  There are also those who argue, John, that nothing has changed; that racism is so embedded in our DNA that there is no use trying politics -- the game is rigged. 

But such theories ignore history.  Yes, itâs true that, despite laws like the Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act and Medicare, our society is still racked with division and poverty.  Yes, race still colors our political debates, and there have been government programs that have fallen short.  In a time when cynicism is too often passed off as wisdom, itâs perhaps easy to conclude that there are limits to change; that we are trapped by our own history; and politics is a foolâs errand, and weâd be better off if we roll back big chunks of LBJâs legacy, or at least if we donât put too much of our hope, invest too much of our hope in our government.

I reject such thinking.  Not just because Medicare and Medicaid have lifted millions from suffering; not just because the poverty rate in this nation would be far worse without food stamps and Head Start and all the Great Society programs that survive to this day.  I reject such cynicism because I have lived out the promise of LBJâs efforts.  Because Michelle has lived out the legacy of those efforts.  Because my daughters have lived out the legacy of those efforts.  Because I and millions of my generation were in a position to take the baton that he handed to us.

Because of the Civil Rights movement, because of the laws President Johnson signed, new doors of opportunity and education swung open for everybody -- not all at once, but they swung open.  Not just blacks and whites, but also women and Latinos; and Asians and Native Americans; and gay Americans and Americans with a disability.  They swung open for you, and they swung open for me.  And thatâs why Iâm standing here today -- because of those efforts, because of that legacy.

And that means weâve got a debt to pay.  That means we canât afford to be cynical.  Half a century later, the laws LBJ passed are now as fundamental to our conception of ourselves and our democracy as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  They are foundational; an essential piece of the American character. 

But we are here today because we know we cannot be complacent.  For history travels not only forwards; history can travel backwards, history can travel sideways.  And securing the gains this country has made requires the vigilance of its citizens.  Our rights, our freedoms -- they are not given.  They must be won.  They must be nurtured through struggle and discipline, and persistence and faith. 

And one concern I have sometimes during these moments, the celebration of the signing of the Civil Rights Act, the March on Washington -- from a distance, sometimes these commemorations seem inevitable, they seem easy.  All the pain and difficulty and struggle and doubt -- all that is rubbed away.  And we look at ourselves and we say, oh, things are just too different now;  we couldnât possibly do what was done then -- these giants, what they accomplished.  And yet, they were men and women, too.  It wasnât easy then.  It wasnât certain then. 

Still, the story of America is a story of progress.  However slow, however incomplete, however harshly challenged at each point on our journey, however flawed our leaders, however many times we have to take a quarter of a loaf or half a loaf -- the story of America is a story of progress.  And thatâs true because of men like President Lyndon Baines Johnson.

In so many ways, he embodied America, with all our gifts and all our flaws, in all our restlessness and all our big dreams.  This man -- born into poverty, weaned in a world full of racial hatred -- somehow found within himself the ability to connect his experience with the brown child in a small Texas town; the white child in Appalachia; the black child in Watts.  As powerful as he became in that Oval Office, he understood them.  He understood what it meant to be on the outside.  And he believed that their plight was his plight too; that his freedom ultimately was wrapped up in theirs; and that making their lives better was what the hell the presidency was for.

And those children were on his mind when he strode to the podium that night in the House Chamber, when he called for the vote on the Civil Rights law.  âIt never occurred to me,â he said, âin my fondest dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those studentsâ that he had taught so many years ago, âand to help people like them all over this country.  But now I do have that chance.  And Iâll let you in on a secret -- I mean to use it.  And I hope that you will use it with me.â7

That was LBJâs greatness.  Thatâs why we remember him.  And if there is one thing that he and this yearâs anniversary should teach us, if thereâs one lesson I hope that Malia and Sasha and young people everywhere learn from this day, itâs that with enough effort, and enough empathy, and enough perseverance, and enough courage, people who love their country can change it.

In his final year, President Johnson stood on this stage, racked with pain, battered by the controversies of Vietnam, looking far older than his 64 years, and he delivered what would be his final public speech. 

âWe have proved that great progress is possible,â he said.  âWe know how much still remains to be done.  And if our efforts continue, and if our will is strong, and if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then, my fellow Americans, I am confident, we shall overcome.â

We shall overcome.  We, the citizens of the United States.  Like Dr. King, like Abraham Lincoln, like countless citizens who have driven this country inexorably forward, President Johnson knew that ours in the end is a story of optimism, a story of achievement and constant striving that is unique upon this Earth.  He knew because he had lived that story.  He believed that together we can build an America that is more fair, more equal, and more free than the one we inherited.  He believed we make our own destiny.  And in part because of him, we must believe it as well.

Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama attacked Republicans Friday for what he depicted as moves to restrict voting, urging a raucous and friendly crowd to fight back in this year's elections.

Speaking to the Rev. Al Sharpton's political rally in a Midtown hotel ballroom, Mr. Obama decried moves to require photo identification at polling places as a Republican-led effort to suppress turnout and shape elections.

""The stark, simple truth is this. The right to vote is threatened today in a way that it has not been since the Voting Rights Act became law nearly five decades ago,"" he said.

He added: ""This recent effort to restrict the vote has not been led by both parties. It's been led by the Republican Party.""

A spokesman for the Republicans responded: ""Embedded in the Republican Party's DNA is a history of championing civil rights,"" which he said today includes ""equal access to a quality education.""

The president's speech doubled as a clarion call for the 2014 election, as he urged the crowd at the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel to vote and take friends to the polls to protect voting rights.

Democrats face a tough road in this year's midterm elections, amid continuing controversy over the Affordable Care Act and Mr. Obama's sagging approval ratings. Some Democrats have already distanced themselves from the president.

The president's brief speech focused on a battle that has raged since the Supreme Court invalidated part of the Voting Rights Act last year, dealing a blow to Mr. Obama and Democrats who say the law is still needed, 49 years after it passed.

In 2006, President George W. Bush signed legislation extending that oversight, which applied mostly to Southern states, through 2031. Last June, however, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to end such federal oversight by invalidating the formula Congress used to determine which jurisdictions had to seek ""preclearance"" from the Justice Department or a federal court to alter election procedures.

Southern Republicans have cheered the ruling, saying the region has changed since the act was passed and that blacks are now registered in large numbers and no longer voting at lower rates than whites.

""To think that government like ours should be continued to be penalized for mistakes of the past, that is contrary to all legal and constitutional principles,"" said Frank ""Butch"" Ellis Jr., the attorney for Shelby County, Ala., which won the Voting Rights Act decision. ""It's saying that some states are less sovereign than others.""

Democrats and Mr. Obama called the ruling a backward step, and the president said Friday that Attorney General Eric Holder would closely review states that change their policies. The attorney general has investigated more than 100 cases since 2009, Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Sharpton said in an interview that fighting over the Voting Rights Act was ""premier"" to the black community.

Mr. Obama's speech came against the backdrop of partisan fights across the country over voting laws, from requiring photo IDs at the polls to curbing online and weekend voting. Eight states passed ""restrictive"" voting laws last year, according to the Brennan School of Justice at New York University.

Leaders in Republican-led states say such laws are designed to prevent fraud, while Mr. Obama said they were political efforts to keep millions of people from the polls.

""Common practices like boarding an airplane and purchasing Sudafed require photo ID and we should expect nothing less for the protection of our right to vote,"" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said last year, after his state passed among the broadest regulations.

Mr. Obama said he wasn't against ""reasonable"" attempts to secure the ballot, but that Republicans couldn't substantiate widespread fraud and that several studies had shown there were few attempts to sabotage the ballot.

""The real voter fraud is people who try to deny our rights by making bogus arguments about voter fraud,"" he said to loud and sustained applause.

Friday marked Mr. Obama's first appearance in front of Mr. Sharpton's organization, the National Action Network, since 2011, when Mr. Obama was running for re-election.

Mr. Sharpton faced tough headlines this week after fresh disclosures about his role as an informant against the mob in the 1980s. He gave a fiery introduction of Mr. Obama, bringing crowd members to their feet. The civil rights leader lauded Mr. Obama for the Affordable Care Act and public education policies, which he said uplifted the black community.

He has also defended Mr. Obama from others in the black community, including radio show host Tavis Smiley and academic Cornel West.

Mr. Sharpton said in the interview that those who didn't like Mr. Obama were ""leading blacks, not black leaders.""
","For three days, the veterans of a long-ago movement reunited and drew together their spiritual heirs to explore the legacy of the Civil Rights Act a half-century after it transformed America. And then the legacy walked onstage.

President Obama presented himself on Thursday as the living, walking, talking and governing embodiment of the landmark 1964 law that banned discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin.

In a speech that stirred an audience of civil rights champions here at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library and Museum, Mr. Obama acknowledged that racism has hardly been erased and that government programs have not always succeeded. But, he added, ""I reject such cynicism because I have lived out the promise of L.B.J.'s efforts, because Michelle has lived out the legacy of those efforts, because my daughters have lived out the legacy of those efforts.""

Thanks to the law and the movement that spawned it and the progress made after it, Mr. Obama said, ""new doors of opportunity and education swung open for everybody,"" regardless of race, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation. ""They swung open for you, and they swung open for me,"" he said. ""And that's why I'm standing here today, because of those efforts, because of that legacy.""

The president's speech marking the 50th anniversary of the law Johnson signed in July 1964 was one more moment for Mr. Obama to address his own role in history. Though Mr. Obama often seemed reluctant to be drawn into discussions of race relations in his first term, insistent on being the president of everyone, he has been more open in talking about it since winning re-election.

The president made unusually personal comments after the case of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager whose death two years ago set off a roiling national debate about race, saying the slain young black man ""could have been me."" He recently created an initiative called My Brother's Keeper to help young men of color and has been more vocal about voting rights and equal pay for women. His administration has become more active in looking for ways to curb racial profiling by law enforcement and disparities in criminal sentencing. On Friday, he will address the Rev. Al Sharpton's organization in New York.

""The second election and final election is behind him so he's free,"" Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, the civil rights icon who introduced Mr. Obama, said in an interview afterward. ""There's something about not having to run again that frees you. He's liberated, and I do think he's speaking out more.""

Still, Mr. Obama used most of Thursday's address to extol Johnson in what could be the most generous speech by any sitting president about the Texan since his funeral, one that all but ignored the Vietnam War. Mr. Obama offered little of his own personal journey on race, which might not have connected to some in the room given that the president, the son of an absent father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas, was a child growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia during the civil rights movement.

Nor did Mr. Obama use the speech to advance his policy priorities. He did not mention overhauling immigration, perhaps his biggest legislative goal, and did not say anything about same-sex marriage, which has been the most expansive social change during his presidency. He did not mention his fight against efforts to discourage voting, which the night before he called ""un-American."" Nor did he cite equal pay for women, the theme of other speeches this week.

""He did a kind of inspiration and that's important,"" the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the longtime civil rights activist, said in an interview. ""But beyond inspiration, we need the legislation, the budget and the policies to protect Johnson's legacy.""

Mr. Obama was one of four presidents to address the conference. Jimmy Carter spoke on Tuesday and Bill Clinton on Wednesday.

Former President George W. Bush used a Thursday evening speech to call the achievement gap between white and black children ""a national scandal"" and urge both parties to address it as the central civil rights issue of the modern era.

As president, Mr. Bush signed the bipartisan No Child Left Behind education law, and he lamented on Thursday that ""gains have stalled"" and noted that a typical 17-year-old African-American student reads at the same level as a 13-year-old white student. Addressing critics of No Child Left Behind, he said he did not object to adjustments.

""But the problem comes when people start to give up on the goal,"" he said. ""Some have ideological objections to any federal role in education. Some are too comfortable with status quo. The alliance between ideology and complacency seems to be getting stronger. I fear that the soft bigotry of low expectations is returning.""

The event felt a little like a time capsule. Between speeches and panels, the audience listened to 1960s anthems by Bob Dylan and watched a grainy black-and-white video with scratchy audio of Johnson. A photo montage recalled the famous, and infamous, moments of the era, then traced the progress of race relations all the way to Mr. Obama's presidency. The crowd stood for the gospel singer Mavis Staples, who performed ""We Shall Overcome.""

On hand were Johnson's two daughters, Luci Baines Johnson and Lynda Bird Johnson Robb; Maria Shriver, the niece of John F. Kennedy; and civil rights figures like Julian Bond and Andrew Young.

Mark K. Updegrove, the library director, showed the Obamas copies of the Emancipation Proclamation, the 13th Amendment ending slavery and signed by Abraham Lincoln, as well as the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts signed by Johnson.

Mr. Obama's encomium to Johnson at times sounded like a rebuttal of critics, mainly on the left, who have compared him unfavorably with the signer of so many major pieces of legislation. ""He was charming when he needed to be, ruthless when required,"" Mr. Obama said. ""He could wear you down with logic and argument, he could horse trade and he could flatter.""

All traits that critics and some supporters say Mr. Obama does not seem to have. But unlike Johnson's powerful Democratic majorities, Mr. Obama has a Republican House, and he argued that progress continued to be made ""however many times we have to take a quarter of a loaf or a half a loaf.""

In a ruminative moment, he said: ""You're reminded daily that in this great democracy, you are but a relay swimmer in the currents of history, bound by decisions made by those who came before, reliant on the efforts of those who will follow to fully vindicate your vision. But the presidency also affords a unique opportunity to bend those currents by shaping our laws and by shaping our debates, by working within the confines of the world as it is but also by reimagining the world as it should be.""

69,69,2014-05-21-VeteransAffairs.txt," Good morning, everybody.  I just met with Secretary Shinseki and Rob Nabors, who Iâve temporarily assigned to work with Secretary Shinseki and the VA.  We focused on two issues:  the allegations of misconduct at Veterans Affairs facilities, and our broader mission of caring for our veterans and their families.

As Commander-in-Chief, I have the honor of standing with our men and women in uniform at every step of their service: from the moment they take their oath, to when our troops prepare to deploy, to Afghanistan -- where they put their lives on the line for our security, to their bedside, as our wounded warriors fight to recover from terrible injuries.  The most searing moments of my presidency have been going to Walter Reed, or Bethesda, or Bagram and meeting troops who have left a part of themselves on the battlefield.  And their spirit and their determination to recover and often to serve again is an inspiration.

So these men and women and their families are the best that our country has to offer.  Theyâve done their duty, and they ask nothing more than that this country does ours -- that we uphold our sacred trust to all who have served.

So when I hear allegations of misconduct -- any misconduct -- whether itâs allegations of VA staff covering up long wait times or cooking the books, I will not stand for it.  Not as Commander-in-Chief, but also not as an American.  None of us should.  So if these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it -- period.

Hereâs what I discussed with Secretary Shinseki this morning.  First, anybody found to have manipulated or falsified records at VA facilities has to be held accountable.  The inspector general at the VA has launched investigations into the Phoenix VA and other facilities.  And some individuals have already been put on administrative leave.  I know that people are angry and want a swift reckoning.  I sympathize with that.  But we have to let the investigators do their job and get to the bottom of what happened.  Our veterans deserve to know the facts.  Their families deserve to know the facts.  And once we know the facts, I assure you -- if there is misconduct, it will be punished.

Second, I want to know the full scope of this problem.  And thatâs why I ordered Secretary Shinseki to investigate.  Today, he updated me on his review, which is looking not just at the Phoenix facility, but also VA facilities across the nation.  And I expect preliminary results from that review next week.

Third, Iâve directed Rob Nabors to conduct a broader review of the Veterans Health Administration -- the part of the VA that delivers health care to our veterans.  And Rob is going to Phoenix today.  Keep in mind, though, even if we had not heard reports out of this Phoenix facility or other facilities, we all know that it often takes too long for veterans to get the care that they need.  Thatâs not a new development.  Itâs been a problem for decades and itâs been compounded by more than a decade of war.

Thatâs why, when I came into office, I said we would systematically work to fix these problems, and we have been working really hard to address them.  My attitude is, for folks who have been fighting on the battlefield, they should not have to fight a bureaucracy at home to get the care that theyâve earned.

So the presumption has always been weâve got to do better.  And Robâs review will be a comprehensive look at the Veterans Health Administrationâs approach currently to access to care.  I want to know whatâs working.  I want to know what is not working.  And I want specific recommendations on how VA can up their game.  And I expect that full report from Rob next month.

Number four -- I said that I expect everyone involved to work with Congress, which has an important oversight role to play.  And I welcome Congress as a partner in our efforts not just to address the current controversies, but to make sure weâre doing right by our veterans across the board.  I served on the Veterans Affairs Committee when I was in the Senate, and it was one of the proudest pieces of business that I did in the legislature.  And I know the folks over there care deeply about our veterans.

It is important that our veterans donât become another political football, especially when so many of them are receiving care right now.  This is an area where Democrats and Republicans should always be working together.

Which brings me to my final point.  Even as we get to the bottom of what happened at Phoenix and other facilities, all of us, whether here in Washington or all across the country, have to stay focused on the larger mission, which is upholding our sacred trust to all of our veterans, bringing the VA system into the 21st century -- which is not an easy task.

We have made progress over the last five years.  Weâve made historic investments in our veterans.  Weâve boosted VA funding to record levels.  And we created consistency through advanced appropriations so that veterans organizations knew their money would be there regardless of political wrangling in Washington.

We made VA benefits available to more than 2 million veterans who did not have it before -- delivering disability pay to more Vietnam vets exposed to Agent Orange; making it easier for veterans with post-traumatic stress and mental health issues and traumatic brain injury to get treatment; and improving care for women veterans.

Because of these steps and the influx of new veterans requiring services added in many cases to wait times, we launched an all-out war on the disability claims backlog.  And in just the past year alone, weâve slashed that backlog by half.

Of course, weâre not going to let up, because itâs still too high.  Weâre going to keep at it until we eliminate the backlog once and for all.  Meanwhile, weâre also reducing homelessness among our veterans.  Weâre helping veterans and their families -- more than a million so far -- pursue their education under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.  Weâre stepping up our efforts to help our newest veterans get the skills and training to find jobs when they come home.  And along with Michelle and Jill Biden and Joining Forces, weâve helped hundreds of thousands of veterans find a job.  More veterans are finding work and veterans unemployment, although still way too high, is coming down.

The point is, caring for our veterans is not an issue that popped up in recent weeks.  Some of the problems with respect to how veterans are able to access the benefits that theyâve earned, thatâs not a new issue.  Thatâs an issue that I was working on when I was running for the United States Senate.  Taking care of our veterans and their families has been one of the causes of my presidency, and it is something that all of us have to be involved with and have to be paying attention to.

We ended the war in Iraq.  And as our war in Afghanistan ends, and as our newest veterans are coming home, the demands on the VA are going to grow.  So weâre going to have to redouble our efforts to get it right as a nation.  And we have to be honest that there are and will continue to be areas where weâve got to do a lot better.

So today, I want every veteran to know we are going to fix whatever is wrong.  And so long as I have the privilege of serving as Commander-in-Chief, Iâm going to keep on fighting to deliver the care and the benefits and the opportunities that your families deserve, now and for decades to come.  That is a commitment to which I feel a sacred duty to maintain.
","President Barack Obama took ownership of the burgeoning crisis at the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying Wednesday that he is ultimately responsible for any misconduct, a move that raises the stakes for the White House as calls accelerate for new leadership at the agency.

Mr. Obama addressed the allegations of wrongdoing at VA hospitals for the first time since remarks three weeks ago in Asia. He said he expects VA Secretary Eric Shinseki next week to provide him with preliminary results of an inquiry into claims by VA employees that patients face excessive wait times for care and that secret bookkeeping was used to cover up the delays.

The president vowed to hold accountable anyone who is found to have been involved in misconduct. While praising Mr. Shinseki's tenure, Mr. Obama indicated in answers to questions that it was possible the VA secretary could ultimately be forced to leave. He also said he assigned a senior White House aide to carry out a comprehensive review of VA health services by next month.

""Once we know the facts, I assure you if there is misconduct, it will be punished,"" he said.

Underscoring the threat, Mr. Shinseki ordered the rescission of a roughly $9,000 bonus paid in 2013 to the director of the Phoenix VA Health Care System, where allegations of misconduct first surfaced last month.

Mr. Obama's comments, which followed an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Shinseki Wednesday morning, capped a weeklong effort by the White House to try to contain a scandal that has widened to more than two dozen VA health facilities across the U.S. since last month.

""They were the right words, and we share the president's urgency to fix what's broke, to hold people appropriately accountable, and to restore faith in the VA,"" said William Thien, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

Criticism of Mr. Obama's handling of the controversy has grown in Congress, with Republicans accusing the president of not acting quickly enough to fix the problems and for waiting too long to speak on the issue.

""This VA issue is a national embarrassment, and the president's response to it is an embarrassment,"" said Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.). ""Tough words just aren't enough when it comes to this issue.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said that ""so far, I have yet to hear from the president that he is treating the VA crisis with the seriousness it deserves.""

During his remarks, Mr. Obama anticipated the GOP criticism, saying: ""It is important that our veterans don't become another political football.""

The inspector general of the VA is conducting a review of allegations at the Phoenix medical center and other VA facilities of extended wait times for care and the creation of unauthorized waiting lists that made official wait times appear to fall within VA targets.

The VA, in coordination with the White House, also has undertaken a review of the allegations that Mr. Obama said will yield preliminary results next week. The comprehensive review Mr. Obama announced Wednesday is a separate effort designed to look more broadly at the VA.

Employees and doctors at the Phoenix health center have said that as many as 40 veterans may have died while waiting for appointments. Richard Griffin, the acting VA inspector general, said last week his office hasn't found any instances of patient deaths because of excessive wait times after reviewing 17 cases.

Mr. Obama said Mr. Shinseki would be part of the effort to assess the problems at the VA and that the president will wait for investigations to be complete to make any decisions on leadership at the agency.

Mr. Obama's backing of Mr. Shinseki -- though the VA secretary didn't appear with the president -- faces pushback. The American Legion has led the call for the resignation of top VA officials, including Mr. Shinseki, while other groups, such as the VFW, have stopped short of that.

On Wednesday, a Democrat, Rep. John Barrow of Georgia, joined the calls for Mr. Shinseki to resign.

Mr. Shinseki didn't respond to a request for comment.

Meantime, the House passed a bill Wednesday evening that would give the VA secretary more power in demoting and firing senior-level employees.

White House press secretary Jay Carney said Mr. Obama supports the principles in the House bill but has some concerns about the legislation.

After the vote, GOP House Speaker John Boehner's official account tweeted that the bill ""is needed now more than ever.""

The widening VA problems pose a thorny challenge for Mr. Obama, who has championed services for military veterans since he was a candidate in 2008. He came into office vowing to create a ""21st century VA"" and implemented changes, including qualifying more veterans with mental-health issues for care.

Critics of his approach say he wasn't involved closely enough and that his aides ignored warning signs of deep-seated problems at the department.

After a relatively muted initial response to the crisis, Mr. Obama last week tapped a senior aide, Rob Nabors, to oversee the VA review and, now, a broader assessment of the agency.

Sharon Helman, the director of the Phoenix VA Health Care System, had received a bonus of about $9,000 on top of her nearly $170,000 salary in 2013, according to a database of federal employee data. As a senior executive service employee, her bonus wasn't unusual.

Ms. Helman was placed on administrative leave earlier this month. On Wednesday, Mr. Shinseki ""exercised his authority to rescind Sharon Helman's fiscal year 2013 performance award immediately,"" the VA said.

Ms. Helman has said she wasn't aware of any secret wait lists, and couldn't be reached for comment on the bonus.
","The White House fought on Tuesday to contain the growing political furor over allegations of misconduct at the nation's veterans hospitals as Republicans, eager to use the issue in the midterm elections, seized on the reports as new evidence that President Obama is unable to govern effectively.

Rob Nabors, the president's deputy chief of staff, will fly to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Phoenix on Wednesday to assess the most damning reports -- that government workers falsified data or created secret waiting lists to hide the long delays veterans faced before seeing doctors.

The president is also sending Denis R. McDonough, his chief of staff, to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to consult with the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont. Lawmakers are working on bipartisan legislation that would give veterans officials greater authority to fire those responsible at the department. The House is expected to vote on Wednesday on a bill, and the Senate is expected to hold hearings on the legislation soon.

Inside the White House, officials said that there was no political panic but that the issue was of serious, substantive concern -- unlike, they said, a previous Republican uproar over extra scrutiny given to Tea Party groups by the Internal Revenue Service.

White House officials described Mr. Obama as eager for the results of an investigation into the allegations by the department's inspector general and a separate review of hospital practices being conducted by Mr. Nabors and Eric Shinseki, the secretary of the department. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, declined to say when Mr. Obama might address the situation again publicly.

""He is not at all pleased with some of the allegations and will be extremely unhappy if some of them prove to be true,"" Mr. Carney said.

Republican lawmakers intensified their criticism of Mr. Obama, and some made it clear they intended to use the incidents at the hospitals as fodder for a broader political theme about incompetence in his administration.

""The election of President Obama ushered in a new era of big government and with it a renewed flurry of mismanagement,"" Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican whip, said in a statement. ""If the president truly did not know about these scandals and mistakes, we should doubt his ability to properly manage the leviathan government that he helped create.""

Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 Republican in the House, told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Obama had not acted swiftly enough. He added that ""it is time for our president to come forward and take responsibility for this and do the right thing by these veterans and begin to show that he actually cares about getting it straight.""

The increasing reports of misconduct at numerous veterans hospitals other than Phoenix in recent weeks have prompted outrage among members of both parties demanding swift action. On Tuesday, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, repeated a call for the F.B.I. to pursue criminal violations.

""People are fed up and impatient,"" Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. ""So am I.""

The incidents have also generated a new round of condemnation from the president's liberal pop culture allies, an indication that anger about the allegations has moved beyond the halls of Congress. On Monday, Jon Stewart on Comedy Central mocked the president's top officials, including Mr. Shinseki, for what he called tepid expressions of outrage and anger in recent days.

Reacting to Mr. Shinseki's declaration that he was ""mad as hell"" about the allegations, Mr. Stewart said, ""Your 'mad as hell' face looks a lot like your 'Oh, we're out of orange juice' face.""

As a candidate for president, Mr. Obama denounced delays and poor care for veterans at hospitals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs and vowed that his administration would address the backlogs and greatly improve care. He pledged in a 2008 campaign speech to build ""a 21st-century V.A."" and to confront what he called ""the broken bureaucracy of the V.A.""

But more than five years into his presidency, Mr. Obama has again found himself exposed to political danger by a bureaucracy that seems beyond his immediate control.

In responding to the allegations of delays at veterans hospitals, the Obama White House has embraced what has become a familiar public relations pattern in dealing with political crises: Administration officials declare their outrage as they urge patience while an investigation is completed.

The White House has also borrowed a page from its response to the debacle of the rollout of HealthCare.gov this past fall, when Mr. Obama sent a top aide to help repair the health care website and impose management discipline. By sending Mr. Nabors to assist Mr. Shinseki in his review, the White House is installing one of its own operatives to provide a direct pipeline of information to Mr. Obama.

So far, White House officials have waved aside calls for Mr. Shinseki to resign in much the same way they rejected calls for the resignation of Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, over the botched health care rollout. Mr. Carney said Monday that the president still has confidence in Mr. Shinseki.

Mr. Carney said the White House was supportive of the goals of legislation probably coming up for a vote on Wednesday in the House. The bill already has more than a half-dozen Democratic co-sponsors, including outspoken liberals such as Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, and is likely to pass overwhelmingly.

But passage of that legislation is not likely to stop Mr. Obama's critics in Congress -- especially Republicans -- from seeking to use the allegations at the veterans hospitals to their political advantage ahead of this fall's elections.

On Tuesday, Representative Jeff Miller, Republican of Florida, the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, criticized officials at the department as failing to respond adequately to a subpoena in the case. Mr. Miller said the committee had requested emails and documents from two dozen officials and had received only 200 emails from one department employee.

""I am quickly getting the impression the department does not want to fully cooperate in this matter,"" Mr. Miller said.

Several Democratic members said they feared that Republicans may be laying the groundwork for a push to privatize veterans' health care and dismantle one of the largest bastions of government health care in the United States.

Mr. Sanders, the Senate veterans panel chairman, said he was willing to work with Republicans to improve health care in the system, but he warned against using the allegations as a political weapon.

""I am going to do everything I can to prevent V.A. health care from being politicized,"" Mr. Sanders said.

He added: ""We are talking about the lives of six and a half million men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend this country, who deserve to be treated with respect, not be made into a political football.""

70,70,2014-07-01-Immigration.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody.  One year ago this month, senators of both parties â- with support from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities â- came together to pass a commonsense immigration bill. 

Independent experts said that bill would strengthen our borders, grow our economy, shrink our deficits.  As we speak, there are enough Republicans and Democrats in the House to pass an immigration bill today.  I would sign it into law today, and Washington would solve a problem in a bipartisan way.

But for more than a year, Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to allow an up-or-down vote on that Senate bill or any legislation to fix our broken immigration system.  And I held off on pressuring them for a long time to give Speaker Boehner the space he needed to get his fellow Republicans on board. 

Meanwhile, hereâs what a year of obstruction has meant.  It has meant fewer resources to strengthen our borders.  Itâs meant more businesses free to game the system by hiring undocumented workers, which punishes businesses that play by the rules, and drives down wages for hardworking Americans.  Itâs meant lost talent when the best and brightest from around the world come to study here but are forced to leave and then compete against our businesses and our workers.  Itâs meant no chance for 11 million immigrants to come out of the shadows and earn their citizenship if they pay a penalty and pass a background check, pay their fair share of taxes, learn English, and go to the back of the line.  Itâs meant the heartbreak of separated families. 

Thatâs what this obstruction has meant over the past year.  Thatâs what the Senate bill would fix if the House allowed it to go to a vote.

Our country and our economy would be stronger today if House Republicans had allowed a simple yes-or-no vote on this bill or, for that matter, any bill.  Theyâd be following the will of the majority of the American people who support reform.  Instead, theyâve proven again and again that theyâre unwilling to stand up to the tea party in order to do whatâs best for the country.  And the worst part about it is a bunch of them know better.

We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.  In recent weeks, weâve seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and traffickers. 

The journey is unbelievably dangerous for these kids.  The children who are fortunate enough to survive it will be taken care of while they go through the legal process, but in most cases that process will lead to them being sent back home.  Iâve sent a clear message to parents in these countries not to put their kids through this.  I recently sent Vice President Biden to meet with Central American leaders and find ways to address the root causes of this crisis.  Secretary Kerry will also be meeting with those leaders again tomorrow.  With our international partners, weâre taking new steps to go after the dangerous smugglers who are putting thousands of childrenâs lives at risk.

Today, I sent a letter to congressional leaders asking that they work with me to address the urgent humanitarian challenge on the border, and support the immigration and Border Patrol agents who already apprehend and deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants every year.  And understand, by the way, for the most part, this is not a situation where these children are slipping through.  Theyâre being apprehended.  But the problem is, is that our system is so broken, so unclear that folks donât know what the rules are.

Now, understand â- there are a number of Republicans who have been willing to work with us to pass real, commonsense immigration reform, and I want to thank them for their efforts.  There are a number of Republican leaders in the Senate who did excellent work and deserve our thanks.  And less visibly, there have been folks in the House who have been trying to work to get this done.  And quietly, because it doesnât always help me to praise them, Iâve expressed to them how much I appreciate the efforts that theyâve made.

I believe Speaker Boehner when he says he wants to pass an immigration bill.  I think he genuinely wants to get something done.  But last week, he informed me that Republicans will continue to block a vote on immigration reform at least for the remainder of this year.  Some in the House Republican Caucus are using the situation with unaccompanied children as their newest excuse to do nothing.  Now, I want everybody to think about that.  Their argument seems to be that because the system is broken, we shouldnât make an effort to fix it.  It makes no sense.  Itâs not on the level.  Itâs just politics, plain and simple. 

Now, there are others in the Republican Caucus in the House who are arguing that they canât act because theyâre mad at me about using my executive authority too broadly.  This also makes no sense.  I donât prefer taking administrative action.  Iâd rather see permanent fixes to the issue we face.  Certainly thatâs true on immigration.  Iâve made that clear multiple times.  I would love nothing more than bipartisan legislation to pass the House, the Senate, land on my desk so I can sign it.  Thatâs true about immigration, thatâs true about the minimum wage, itâs true about equal pay.  There are a whole bunch of things where I would greatly prefer Congress actually do something.  I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing.  And in this situation, the failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, itâs bad for our economy, and itâs bad for our future. 

So while I will continue to push House Republicans to drop the excuses and act â- and I hope their constituents will too -â America cannot wait forever for them to act.  And thatâs why, today, Iâm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress.  As a first step, Iâm directing the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to move available and appropriate resources from our interior to the border.  Protecting public safety and deporting dangerous criminals has been and will remain the top priority, but we are going to refocus our efforts where we can to make sure we do what it takes to keep our border secure. 

I have also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.  If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours.  I expect their recommendations before the end of summer and I intend to adopt those recommendations without further delay. 

Of course, even with aggressive steps on my part, administrative action alone will not adequately address the problem.  The reforms that will do the most to strengthen our businesses, our workers, and our entire economy will still require an act of Congress.  And I repeat:  These are reforms that already enjoy the wide support of the American people.  Itâs very rare where you get labor, business, evangelicals, law enforcement all agreeing on what needs to be done.  And at some point, that should be enough.  Normally, that is enough.  The point of public service is to solve public problems.  And those of us who have the privilege to serve have a responsibility to do everything in our power to keep Americans safe and to keep the doors of opportunity open. 

And if we do, then one year from now, not only would our economy and our security be stronger, but maybe the best and the brightest from around the world who come study here would stay and create jobs here.  Maybe companies that play by the rules will no longer be undercut by companies that donât.  Maybe more families whoâve been living here for years, whose children are often U.S. citizens, who are our neighbors and our friends, whose children are our kidsâ friends and go to school with them, and play on ball teams with them, maybe those families would get to stay together.  But much of this only happens if Americans continue to push Congress to get this done.

So Iâve told Speaker Boehner that even as I take those steps that I can within my existing legal authorities to make the immigration system work better, Iâm going to continue to reach out to House Republicans in the hope that they deliver a more permanent solution with a comprehensive bill.  Maybe it will be after the midterms, when theyâre less worried about politics.  Maybe it will be next year.  Whenever it is, they will find me a willing partner.  I have been consistent in saying that I am prepared to work with them even on a bill that I don't consider perfect.  And the Senate bill was a good example of the capacity to compromise and get this done.  The only thing I canât do is stand by and do nothing while waiting for them to get their act together. 

And I want to repeat what I said earlier.  If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is passing bills.  Pass a bill; solve a problem.  Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done.  Because if we pass a bill, that will supplant whatever Iâve done administratively.  Weâll have a structure there that works, and it will be permanent.  And people can make plans and businesses can make plans based on the law.  And there will be clarity both here inside this country and outside it.

Let me just close by saying Friday is the Fourth of July.  Itâs the day we celebrate our independence and all the things that make this country so great.  And each year, Michelle and I host a few hundred servicemembers and wounded warriors and their families right here on the lawn for a barbecue and fireworks on the Mall.

And some of the servicemembers coming this year are unique because they signed up to serve, to sacrifice, potentially to give their lives for the security of this country even though they werenât yet Americans.  That's how much they love this country.  They were prepared to fight and die for an America they did not yet fully belong to.  I think theyâve earned their stripes in more ways than one.  And thatâs why on Friday morning weâre going to naturalize them in a ceremony right here at the White House.  This Independence Day will be their first day as American citizens. 

One of the things we celebrate on Friday â- one of the things that make this country great â- is that we are a nation of immigrants.  Our people come from every corner of the globe.  That's what makes us special.  That's what makes us unique.  And throughout our history, weâve come here in wave after wave from everywhere understanding that there was something about this place where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts; that all the different cultures and ideas and energy would come together and create something new.

We won this countryâs freedom together.  We built this country together.  We defended this country together.  It makes us special.  It makes us strong.  It makes us Americans.  Thatâs worth celebrating.  And that's what I want not just House Republicans but all of us as Americans to remember.

Thanks very much.
","President Barack Obama said Monday he would begin using his authority to bolster border security and consider taking other steps on his own to change the nation's immigration policy, after angrily declaring that Republicans had finally killed off any chances for immigration legislation this year.

The announcement, in a Rose Garden statement, marked a significant setback for Mr. Obama's second-term agenda and for the constellation of business organizations, Hispanic-Americans and religious groups that had pressed for a sweeping immigration overhaul.

""America cannot wait forever for them to act,"" Mr. Obama said of Republican lawmakers. ""That's why today I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress.""

It appears all but certain the administration will make at least minor adjustments to deportation policy later this summer that would shield some illegal immigrants from deportation. What additional steps Mr. Obama may take are unclear.

The president faces pressure from immigration activists to grant work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants, using executive authority that he has suggested many times he doesn't have.

Any executive action on immigration is likely to further infuriate a Republican Party that already accuses Mr. Obama of overreach in bypassing Congress to put in place changes to immigration, energy, minimum wage and other policies.

The collapse of Mr. Obama's top legislative priority is a win for conservatives who argued that giving legal status to people in the U.S. illegally would be an inappropriate form of amnesty, and that allowing more immigrants into the country would drive down American wages. It also is a victory for Republicans who wanted to avoid a divisive immigration debate in an election year.

But it leaves Republicans with the same problem they faced in the presidential election two years ago -- a disadvantage with the growing bloc of Hispanic voters. Many in the GOP have cautioned that the party won't win another national election unless it finds a way to improve the party's standing with Latinos. That isn't possible, many caution, without passing an immigration bill.

""In the short term, Republicans are going to avoid an internal civil war over an issue over which they are bitterly divided,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst. ""But in the longer term, Republicans will not have resolved an issue that is a huge problem for them in a presidential election year.""

Mr. Obama had put immigration atop his second-term agenda and ran for re-election promising that he would find common ground with the GOP on issues such as immigration. He said Mr. Boehner told him by phone last week that there would be no action in the House on immigration this year.

Mr. Boehner blamed the president for the House's inaction. ""In our conversation last week, I told the president what I have been telling him for months: the American people and their elected officials don't trust him to enforce the law as written,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""Until that changes, it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue.""

Even with this impasse, Mr. Obama is asking Congress to act on a separate immigration proposal meant to stem the recent surge in children and families from Central America crossing the southern border, which on Monday the president called an ""urgent humanitarian challenge."" He plans to request more than $2 billion to detain families and bolster border security, and he wants a change in law so that the administration can return certain children more quickly to their home countries.

That proposal, made in a letter to congressional leaders on Monday, found tentative support from Republicans. But it was met with angry opposition from advocates for immigrants, who said the president should focus on the root causes of the surge in migration, not on jailing and deporting people fleeing violence.

The death of immigration legislation is part of a broader collapse of the business community's top legislative priorities this year, straining its relations with the GOP. Two other business priorities -- a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and measures to replenish the Highway trust Fund -- are in jeopardy amid opposition or policy demands by fiscal conservatives and tea-party activists.

Johanna Schneider, a Republican political strategist and former executive director for the Business Roundtable, said a rift is growing between the Republican Party and business organizations. Business groups, she said, may ""need to make their case clearer to tea-party activists.""

The president has the authority to decide how to deploy enforcement resources, and his administration is allowed to exercise prosecutorial discretion in handling cases of people facing deportation. But he doesn't have the authority to enact major immigration-law changes favored by many businesses, which include more visas for high-tech workers and a new guest-worker program for low-skilled workers.

Initially, the president is only promising modest steps. He said he would move available enforcement personnel from the nation's interior to the border. The White House said the administration would continue to deport illegal immigrants who committed serious crimes, but the shift in resources could mean that other undocumented residents will be less likely to face removal.

Beyond that, Mr. Obama's plans are unclear. He said he had directed his staff to look for ""additional actions"" and send him recommendations by the end of the summer.

Prospects were bright for immigration legislation at the start of Mr. Obama's second term, as prominent Republicans -- including Mr. Boehner -- backed the legislation, saying their election loss underscored the party's need to draw in Hispanic voters.

By last summer, the Senate had passed bipartisan immigration legislation to bolster border security, overhaul the legal-immigration system and provide a pathway to citizenship for many of the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally.

But it went nowhere in the House through 2013. At the start of 2014, Mr. Boehner laid out a set of GOP ""standards"" to guide immigration legislation. But many Republicans objected to staging a divisive debate during an election year. A week later, the speaker backtracked, unable to persuade Republicans who felt little urgency.


","President Obama said Monday he would use his executive power to make potentially sweeping changes to the nation's immigration system without Congress, acknowledging the death of his more than yearlong effort to enact compromise legislation granting legal status to 11 million immigrants here illegally.

Mr. Obama said he had ordered a shift of immigration enforcement resources from the interior of the country toward the southern border, and was asking his team to report back to him by the end of the summer on additional actions he could take. The actions could be as far-reaching as giving work permits and protection from deportation to millions of immigrants now in the country.

Mr. Obama angrily blamed congressional Republicans for the collapse of the legislative effort.

""While I will continue to push House Republicans to drop the excuses and act -- and I hope their constituents will, too -- America cannot wait forever for them to act,"" Mr. Obama said in a statement from the Rose Garden, in which he made plain his frustration about what he called Republicans' failure ""to pass a darn bill.""

""I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress,"" he added.

The White House said Mr. Obama decided to take action after Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican from Ohio, told him last week that the House would not vote on immigration legislation this year.

Mr. Obama's Rose Garden appearance was a defiant end to a politically fraught effort, filled with near-death turns and promises of resuscitation, to reach a bipartisan deal in Congress to overhaul immigration laws. Polls show such a measure enjoys support from a lopsided majority of Americans. But while the Senate passed a bill a year ago with some Republican support, there was no urgency to follow suit in the House, where conservatives dominate and the Tea Party is ascendant. In announcing the action, Mr. Obama signaled that he is increasingly willing to act unilaterally to carry out elements of his agenda that are stalled on Capitol Hill, even as he faces Republican criticism for his use of executive power.

The move sets the stage for particularly bitter partisan rancor over immigration that could weigh heavily on the midterm elections this fall. Mr. Obama said he would quickly adopt his team's end-of-summer recommendations for executive actions, meaning he could move on the issue only weeks before the November balloting.

At the same time, Mr. Obama's latest move came as he was facing twin pressures, both from immigrant advocates who say he has done too little on the issue, and from Republicans who blame his policies for a recent illegal surge of Central American migrants -- many of them unaccompanied children -- across the South Texas border.

Republicans blamed the president for the death of the immigration legislation. ""The crisis at our southern border reminds us all of the critical importance of fixing our broken immigration system,"" Mr. Boehner said. ""It is sad and disappointing that, faced with this challenge, President Obama won't work with us, but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems.""

Mr. Obama moved in 2012 to give work permits and temporary protection from deportation to young unauthorized immigrants who came as children. More than 550,000 youths received two-year deportation deferrals, and they are now renewing them for another two years.

Since then, the president has considered broader executive actions that would reduce the number of deportations -- including offering the same protections and work permits to other categories of unauthorized immigrants -- but his team had delayed taking them to avoid interfering with potential congressional action.

In a nearly hourlong meeting with immigration advocates before his announcement, Mr. Obama made it clear he considered that wait over, and was weighing the full range of options legally at his disposal, attendees said.

""He said, 'I recognize the heroic effort we've all made to push for legislation is dead for the year, and that means it's time for us to tee up executive actions that will do what we can,' "" said Frank Sharry of the advocacy group America's Voice, who attended the session. ""I'm surprised and pleased. He recognized that legislation has been blocked by Republicans, and that there's no sense in engaging in wishful thinking.""

Representative Luis V. GutiÃ©rrez, a Democrat from Illinois who is one of the most outspoken supporters of legislation with a pathway to citizenship for immigrants here illegally, and who has been critical of Mr. Obama for his deportations record, praised the president on Monday.

""The antidote for do-nothingism is doing something, and the president is doing for the American people what the Republican-controlled Congress refused to do,"" Mr. GutiÃ©rrez said. ""This is the president I voted for.""

Just hours before his announcement, Mr. Obama wrote to congressional leaders saying he would soon request emergency funding -- expected to top $2 billion -- to address the Southwestern influx as well as additional authority for the Department of Homeland Security to speed the return of the unaccompanied children to their countries of origin. That move set off outrage among some immigrant and refugee advocates who said it would further endanger vulnerable children fleeing violence in their home countries.

""This is like a fireman showing up at a burning house and locking the doors,"" said Kevin Appleby, the director of policy, migration and refugee services at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He called the president's proposed changes to border policy ""inhumane.""

Republicans have seized on the Central American surge as a cudgel to criticize the president's approach on immigration, and said further executive orders would invite legal action.

""If the president insists on enacting amnesty by executive order,"" said Representative Lamar Smith, a Republican from Texas who has been among the most active in opposing overhaul legislation in the House, ""he will undoubtedly face a lawsuit and will find himself, once again, on the wrong side of the Constitution and the law.""

The Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, in McAllen, Tex., on Monday after visiting a Border Patrol station crowded with recently apprehended migrants, said 150 Border Patrol agents would be moved immediately from other parts of the country to the Rio Grande Valley. He said other Homeland Security officers and Justice Department officials, including immigration judges, were also being reassigned.

71,71,2014-08-08-IraqAirstrikes.txt,"Good evening.  Today I authorized two operations in Iraq -- targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water and facing almost certain death.  Let me explain the actions weâre taking and why.    

First, I said in June -- as the terrorist group ISIL began an advance across Iraq -- that the United States would be prepared to take targeted military action in Iraq if and when we determined that the situation required it.  In recent days, these terrorists have continued to move across Iraq, and have neared the city of Erbil, where American diplomats and civilians serve at our consulate and American military personnel advise Iraqi forces. 

To stop the advance on Erbil, Iâve directed our military to take targeted strikes against ISIL terrorist convoys should they move toward the city.  We intend to stay vigilant, and take action if these terrorist forces threaten our personnel or facilities anywhere in Iraq, including our consulate in Erbil and our embassy in Baghdad.  Weâre also providing urgent assistance to Iraqi government and Kurdish forces so they can more effectively wage the fight against ISIL.

Second, at the request of the Iraqi government -- weâve begun operations to help save Iraqi civilians stranded on the mountain1.  As ISIL has marched across Iraq, it has waged a ruthless campaign against innocent Iraqis.  And these terrorists have been especially barbaric towards religious minorities, including Christian and Yezidis, a small and ancient religious sect.  Countless Iraqis have been displaced.  And chilling reports describe ISIL militants rounding up families, conducting mass executions, and enslaving Yezidi women. 

In recent days, Yezidi women, men and children from the area of Sinjar have fled for their lives.  And thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands -- are now hiding high up on the mountain, with little but the clothes on their backs.  Theyâre without food, theyâre without water.  People are starving.  And children are dying of thirst.  Meanwhile, ISIL forces below have called for the systematic destruction of the entire Yezidi people, which would constitute genocide.  So these innocent families are faced with a horrible choice:  descend the mountain and be slaughtered, or stay and slowly die of thirst and hunger.

Iâve said before, the United States cannot and should not intervene every time thereâs a crisis in the world.  So let me be clear about why we must act, and act now.  When we face a situation like we do on that mountain -- with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale, when we have a mandate to help -- in this case, a request from the Iraqi government -- and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye.  We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a potential act of genocide.  Thatâs what weâre doing on that mountain.

Iâve, therefore, authorized targeted airstrikes, if necessary, to help forces in Iraq as they fight to break the siege of Mount Sinjar and protect the civilians trapped there.  Already, American aircraft have begun conducting humanitarian airdrops of food and water to help these desperate men, women and children survive.  Earlier this week, one Iraqi in the area cried to the world, ""There is no one coming to help."" Well today, America is coming to help.  Weâre also consulting with other countries -- and the United Nations -- who have called for action to address this humanitarian crisis. 

I know that many of you are rightly concerned about any American military action in Iraq, even limited strikes like these.  I understand that.  I ran for this office in part to end our war in Iraq and welcome our troops home, and thatâs what weâve done.  As Commander-in-Chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq.  And so even as we support Iraqis as they take the fight to these terrorists, American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq, because thereâs no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq.  The only lasting solution is reconciliation among Iraqi communities and stronger Iraqi security forces. 

However, we can and should support moderate forces who can bring stability to Iraq.  So even as we carry out these two missions, we will continue to pursue a broader strategy that empowers Iraqis to confront this crisis.  Iraqi leaders need to come together and forge a new government that represents the legitimate interests of all Iraqis, and that can fight back against the threats like ISIL.  Iraqis have named a new President, a new Speaker of Parliament, and are seeking consensus on a new Prime Minister.  This is the progress that needs to continue in order to reverse the momentum of the terrorists who prey on Iraqâs divisions.

Once Iraq has a new government, the United States will work with it and other countries in the region to provide increased support to deal with this humanitarian crisis and counterterrorism challenge.  None of Iraqâs neighbors have an interest in this terrible suffering or instability.

And so weâll continue to work with our friends and allies to help refugees get the shelter and food and water they so desperately need, and to help Iraqis push back against ISIL.  The several hundred American advisors that I ordered to Iraq will continue to assess what more we can do to help train, advise and support Iraqi forces going forward.  And just as I consulted Congress on the decisions I made today, we will continue to do so going forward.

My fellow Americans, the world is confronted by many challenges.  And while America has never been able to right every wrong, America has made the world a more secure and prosperous place.  And our leadership is necessary to underwrite the global security and prosperity that our children and our grandchildren will depend upon.  We do so by adhering to a set of core principles.  We do whatever is necessary to protect our people.  We support our allies when theyâre in danger.  We lead coalitions of countries to uphold international norms.  And we strive to stay true to the fundamental values -- the desire to live with basic freedom and dignity -- that is common to human beings wherever they are.  Thatâs why people all over the world look to the United States of America to lead.  And thatâs why we do it.

So let me close by assuring you that there is no decision that I take more seriously than the use of military force.  Over the last several years, we have brought the vast majority of our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan.  And Iâve been careful to resist calls to turn time and again to our military, because America has other tools in our arsenal than our military.  We can also lead with the power of our diplomacy, our economy, and our ideals.

But when the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action.  Thatâs my responsibility as Commander-in-Chief.  And when many thousands of innocent civilians are faced with the danger of being wiped out, and we have the capacity to do something about it, we will take action.  That is our responsibility as Americans.  Thatâs a hallmark of American leadership.  Thatâs who we are.

So tonight, we give thanks to our men and women in uniform  -â especially our brave pilots and crews over Iraq who are protecting our fellow Americans and saving the lives of so many men, women and children that they will never meet.  They represent American leadership at its best.  As a nation, we should be proud of them, and of our countryâs enduring commitment to uphold our own security and the dignity of our fellow human beings.

God bless our Armed Forces, and God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama authorized targeted airstrikes and emergency assistance missions in northern Iraq, saying Thursday the U.S. must act to protect American personnel and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the face of advances by violent Islamist militants.

The U.S. military said it completed a delivery of meals and water to thousands of members of a religious minority who fled the town of Sinjar and are trapped in nearby mountains by the group calling itself the Islamic State.

Mr. Obama said he ordered the use of U.S. airstrikes if necessary either to stop militants from closing in on the northern city of Erbil or to allow local forces to aid the Yazidis, the religious minority. No U.S. strikes had been conducted by late Thursday, officials said.

His remarks at the White House capped a day of soaring concern about militant advances in Iraq, where extremist fighters seized control of areas long considered safe and took over the Mosul Dam, the country's largest, according to local reports.

But Mr. Obama also acknowledged domestic jitters about renewed military involvement in Iraq, where America fought an eight-year war.

""American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq because there is no American military solution to the crisis in Iraq,"" he said, emphasizing the word ""American.""

""The only lasting solution is reconciliation among Iraq communities and stronger Iraqi security forces,"" he said. Separately, Secretary of State John Kerry in a statement stressed the U.S. view that Iraq can only regain stability through the formation of a new, more inclusive government.

The sudden acceleration of U.S. military activity reflected White House concern over a burgeoning crisis in the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq. An Iraqi military official said the Iraqi air force conducted its own airstrikes in the area Thursday.

The White House and Pentagon previously have said they reserve the right to use force in Iraq to protect Americans, and repeated that stance Thursday. The U.S. troops in Erbil are part of a force of planners and advisers working in joint U.S.-Iraqi centers.

The U.S. has considered airstrikes before in Iraq, but backed down as the advance by Sunni militants slowed and the threat against Baghdad seemed to diminish. But the extremists have renewed their push in recent days, this time against Kurdish controlled territories.

At the same time, tens of thousands of Iraqi Christians fled an advance by Islamic State militants into the country's Christian heartland in the north. It appears to be a strategic push by Islamic State toward the semiautonomous Kurdish region, so far insulated from the militant takeover of parts of Iraq and a haven for people displaced from other parts of the country.

The United Nations Security Council met in an emergency session on the Iraq crisis Thursday and expressed ""deep outrage"" about the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis -- especially those from vulnerable minorities -- who have been displaced and persecuted by Islamic State militants.

The latest rapid advance by Islamic State on the Christian area and the crisis involving the Yazidis are both taking place in the same northern province, Nineveh, where the militant group took the provincial capital Mosul on June 10 and sent Iraq into its worst crisis in years.

An Iraqi military official said the Iraqi air force conducted strikes Thursday in Nineveh on the city of Mosul and closer to Erbil province, and on Tikrit in Salaheddine province. The air force has bombed insurgent positions in Mosul and in Tikrit -- which Islamic State took on June 11, the day after it seized Mosul -- and its surroundings as part of a counteroffensive, Iraqi officials say.

Insurgents took over six towns in northern Iraq over the past two days -- two of them after the Kurdish regional forces guarding them, the Peshmerga, withdrew, local officials and residents said Thursday. The 190,000-strong Peshmerga have a fearsome reputation and are well-trained, but not well equipped. Many of the more battle-hardened fighters are now aging.

""People are fleeing because there is no trust that the Peshmerga can protect them,"" said Yonadam Kanna, a parliamentarian and leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement, one of Iraq's strongest Christian parties.

""This isn't an equal fight between the Peshmerga and the Islamic State,"" Mr. Kanna said. ""The Islamic State has much bigger and more powerful weapons than the Peshmerga do. These people want to die and have lunch with the Prophet Muhammad. The Peshmerga want to live and go home to have dinner with their wives. They won't play as dirty as the Islamic State does in war.""

The Kurdish foreign minister welcomed Washington's aid pledge but stressed that no commitments had been given to provide Kurdish fighters with weapons or ammunition to repel Islamic State advances.

In a telephone interview from Erbil, Falah Mustafa Bakir said Peshmerga retreats in recent days were calculated to protect civilians from indiscriminate attacks and didn't represent a military collapse along the lines of the Iraqi army earlier this summer.

""President Obama considering the airdrop and other military options will be an important show of support,"" he said. ""This is what is needed, especially for people stranded in Sinjar. These people are in dire need of whatever assistance is possible and an airdrop is the only way. We also welcome airstrikes.""

On Sunday, the militants seized Sinjar, a Kurdish-controlled town with a large population of Yazidis, a Kurdish-speaking group that follows a pre-Islamic religion. U.N. groups have estimated as many as 40,000 Yazidis have fled to the mountains without food or water and are trapped there, with all access roads controlled by Islamic State. The United Nations Children's Fund said 40 refugee children have died.

The advancing militants killed some of the Yazidis who remained in the area known as the Sinjar plains, according to locals who fled and U.S. officials.

""They are unable to access food and water,"" said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. ""They don't have any access to shelter . . . This is a terrible humanitarian situation.""

The stranded Yazidis are the last surviving community in their ancestral homeland of the Yazidis, long misunderstood by the outside world as ""devil-worshippers."" The assault on the community is part of a pattern by extremists of stamping out non-Islamic religious observation.

Iraqi officials and aid workers say at least one airdrop over the Sinjar mountains coordinated by Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government provided drinkable water. But officials said the attempt reached only a small number of the tens of thousands of displaced.

U.S. intelligence reports on the fate of the Yazidis closely mirror dire media reports, officials said. Vian Dakhil, the only Yazidi in the Iraqi parliament, said this week 70 children had died and Islamic State had killed more than 500 men. ""There is a collective attempt to exterminate the Yazidi people,"" she said.

U.S. officials said they have received a formal request for assistance, but didn't say if it was from the Kurdish regional authorities or the central government in Iraq. As part of the effort to send military advisers to Iraq, the U.S. has set up coordination centers in both Baghdad and Erbil, the Kurdish regional capital.

The advance of insurgents into Christian areas sent families packing into cars or fleeing on foot as the militants pushed their offensive closer to the semiautonomous Kurdish region.

Islamic State -- a spinoff of al Qaeda that was previously known as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS -- pressed forward an offensive in northern Iraq after seizing Mosul.

The Mosul dam, a key source of electricity, would give Islamic State leverage over Baghdad -- if the facility is damaged or destroyed, it could flood entire cities, even Baghdad, some 300 miles away. The dam provides electricity to and controls the water supply in Mosul and the surrounding area.

Islamic State, emboldened in Iraq after seizing parts of northern and eastern Syria, aims to carve out an Islamic state across borders of neighboring Middle Eastern nations.

In their latest rapid advance, Islamic State entered Tal Keif, some 10 miles north of Mosul in Nineveh province, late Wednesday, the town's mayor said. They took over Qara Qosh, east of Mosul on Thursday morning, a security official said.

Two other towns in the area, Bartella and Karmalees, also fell under Islamic State control overnight, said Joseph Thomas, the Chaldean archbishop of Kirkuk and Sulaymaniya. He and local officials said the latest advance has nearly purged northwestern Iraq of its Christian population.

""Those towns are now devoid of their original inhabitants. The displaced people are roaming the roads and riding whatever vehicle they can to get out,"" the archbishop said.

Tal Keif Mayor Bassem Bello said people also fled his town by foot, as cars jammed the road to make the hourlong drive to the province of Dohuk -- part of the Kurdish region -- overnight.

""The Nineveh plain yesterday was emptied of its people,"" Mr. Bello said by telephone Thursday. ""There is not a Christian town left standing.""


","President Obama on Thursday announced he had authorized limited airstrikes against Islamic militants in Iraq, scrambling to avert the fall of the Kurdish capital, Erbil, and returning the United States to a significant battlefield role in Iraq for the first time since the last American soldier left the country at the end of 2011.

Speaking at the White House on Thursday night, Mr. Obama also said that American military aircraft had dropped food and water to tens of thousands of Iraqis trapped on a barren mountain range in northwestern Iraq, having fled the militants, from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, who threaten them with what Mr. Obama called ""genocide.""

""Earlier this week, one Iraqi cried that there is no one coming to help,"" Mr. Obama said in a somber statement delivered from the State Dining Room. ""Well, today America is coming to help.""

The president insisted that these military operations did not amount to a full-scale re-engagement in Iraq. But the relentless advance of the militants, whom he described as ""barbaric,"" has put them within a 30-minute drive of Erbil, raising an immediate danger for the American diplomats, military advisers and other citizens who are based there.

""As commander in chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into another war in Iraq,"" said Mr. Obama, who built his run for the White House in part around his opposition to the war in Iraq.

While Mr. Obama has authorized airstrikes, American officials said there had not yet been any as of late Thursday. In addition to protecting Americans in Erbil and Baghdad, the president said he had authorized airstrikes, if necessary, to break the siege on Mount Sinjar, where tens of thousands of Yazidis, a religious minority group closely allied with the Kurds, have sought refuge.

The aircraft assigned to dropping food and water over the mountainside were a single C-17 and two C-130 aircraft. They were escorted by a pair of F-18 jet fighters, the administration official said. The planes were over the drop zone for about 15 minutes, and flew at a relatively low altitude. They flew over the Mount Sinjar area for less than 15 minutes, Pentagon officials said, and dropped a total of 5,300 gallons of fresh drinking water and 8,000 meals ready to eat. Mr. Obama, officials said, delayed announcing the steps he intended to take in Iraq until the planes had safely cleared the area.

A senior administration official said that the humanitarian effort would continue as needed, and that he expected further airdrops. ""We expect that need to continue,"" he said.

The official said that as conditions in Iraq deteriorated in recent days, the United States had worked with Iraqi security forces and Kurdish fighters to coordinate the response to militant advances. The official said the cooperation had included airstrikes by Iraqi forces against militant targets in the north.

Kurdish and Iraqi officials said that airstrikes were carried out Thursday night on two towns in northern Iraq seized by ISIS -- Gwer and Mahmour, near Erbil. Earlier on Thursday, The New York Times quoted Kurdish and Iraqi officials as saying that the strikes were carried out by American planes.

While the militants are not believed to have surface-to-air missiles, they do have machine guns that could hit planes flying at a low altitude, said James M. Dubik, a retired Army lieutenant general who oversaw the training of the Iraqi Army in 2007 and 2008.

""These are low and slow aircraft,"" General Dubik said. At a minimum, he said, the United States must be prepared for ""some defensive use of air power to prevent"" the militants from attacking American planes, or going after the humanitarian supplies.

For Mr. Obama, who has steadfastly avoided being drawn into the sectarian furies of the Middle East, the decision raises a host of difficult questions, injecting the American military into Iraq's broader political struggle -- something Mr. Obama said he would not agree to unless Iraq's three main ethnic groups agreed on a national unity government.

The decision could also open Mr. Obama to charges that he is willing to use American military might to protect Iraqi Christians and other religious minorities but not to prevent the slaughter of Muslims by other Muslims, either in Iraq or neighboring Syria.

But the president said the imminent threat to Erbil and the dire situation unfolding on Mount Sinjar met both his criteria for deploying American force: protecting American lives and assets, and averting a humanitarian disaster.

""When we have the unique capacity to avert a massacre, the United States cannot turn a blind eye,"" he said.

Mr. Obama has been reluctant to order direct military action in Iraq while Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki remains in office, but in recent weeks there have been repeated pleas from the Kurdish officials for weapons and assistance as ISIS militants have swept across northwestern Iraq. The militants, an offshoot of Al Qaeda, view Iraq's majority Shiite and minority Christians and Yazidis as infidels.

Deliberations at the White House went on all day Thursday as reports surfaced that administration officials were considering either humanitarian flights, airstrikes or both.

Shortly after 6 p.m., the White House posted a photo of Mr. Obama consulting his national security team in the Situation Room. To his right was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey. Watching from across the table were Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, and her principal deputy, Antony J. Blinken. On the wall behind them, the clock recorded the time: 10:37 a.m.

Mr. Obama made only one public appearance, a rushed visit to Fort Belvoir, Va., where he signed into law a bill expanding access to health care for veterans. But aides suggested he might make a statement Thursday night. Before getting into his limousine, Mr. Obama was observed holding an intense conversation with his chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, stabbing his finger several times for emphasis.

Later, Mr. McDonough telephoned the House speaker, John A. Boehner, to inform him of the president's plans, and other White House officials spoke with lawmakers -- all in an effort to avoid bruised feelings like those that followed the prisoner swap for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.

Administration officials said on Thursday that the crisis on Mount Sinjar in northwestern Iraq had forced their hand. Some 40 children have already died from the heat and dehydration, according to Unicef, while as many as 40,000 people have been sheltering in the bare mountains without food, water or access to supplies.

Still, offensive strikes on militant targets around Erbil and Baghdad would take American involvement in the conflict to a new level -- in effect, turning the American Air Force into the Iraqi Air Force.

""The White House is going to recognize that the need to commit air power to Iraq, even for a purely humanitarian mission, is going to open them up to greater criticism for their disengagement from Iraq,"" said Kenneth M. Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""So they will do their damnedest not to get further involved in Iraq because that would just further validate those criticisms.""

Ever since Sunni militants with ISIS took over Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, on June 10, Iraqis have feared that Baghdad, to the south, was the insurgents' ultimate goal. But in recent weeks, the militant group has concentrated on trying to push the Kurds back from areas where Sunnis also live along the border between Kurdistan and Nineveh Province.

It has taken on the powerful Kurdish militias, which were thought to be a bulwark against the advance, and which control huge oil reserves in Kurdistan and broader parts of northern Iraq. An administration official said the United States would expedite the delivery of weapons to the Kurds.

For Mr. Obama, the suffering of the refugees on the mountainside appeared to be a tipping point. He spoke in harrowing terms about their dire circumstances, saying thousands of people were ""hiding high up on the mountain, with little but the clothes on their backs.""

""They're without food, they're without water,"" he said. ""People are starving. And children are dying of thirst. These innocent families are faced with a horrible choice: descend the mountain and be slaughtered, or stay and slowly die of thirst and hunger.""

72,72,2014-08-12-FergusonMissouri.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody. This sound system is really powerful.  Today, Iâd like to update the American people on two issues that Iâve been monitoring closely these last several days.

First of all, we continue to make progress in carrying out our targeted military operations in Iraq.  Last week, I authorized two limited missions:  protecting our people and facilities inside of Iraq, and a humanitarian operation to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians stranded on a mountain.1

A week ago, we assessed that many thousands of Yezidi men, women and children had abandoned their possessions to take refuge on Mount Sinjar in a desperate attempt to avoid slaughter.  We also knew that ISIL terrorists were killing and enslaving Yezidi civilians in their custody, and laying siege to the mountain. Without food or water, they faced a terrible choice -- starve on the mountain, or be slaughtered on the ground.  Thatâs when America came to help.

Over the last week, the U.S. military conducted humanitarian air drops every night -- delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water.  We were joined in that effort by the United Kingdom, and other allies pledged support. Our military was able to successfully strike ISIL targets around the mountain, which improved conditions for civilians to evacuate the mountain safely.

Yesterday, a small team of Americans -- military and civilian -- completed their review of the conditions on the mountain.  They found that food and water have been reaching those in need, and that thousands of people have been evacuating safely each and every night.  The civilians who remain continue to leave, aided by Kurdish forces and Yezidis who are helping to facilitate the safe passage of their families.  So the bottom line is, is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved and Americans should be very proud of our efforts.

Because of the skill and professionalism of our military -- and the generosity of our people -- we broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar; we helped vulnerable people reach safety; and we helped save many innocent lives.  Because of these efforts, we do not expect there to be an additional operation to evacuate people off the mountain, and itâs unlikely that weâre going to need to continue humanitarian air drops on the mountain.  The majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving Iraq in the coming days.  And I just want to say that as Commander-in-Chief, I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly.  Iâm very grateful to them and I know that those who were trapped on that mountain are extraordinarily grateful as well.

Now, the situation remains dire for Iraqis subjected to ISILâs terror throughout the country, and this includes minorities like Yezidis and Iraqi Christians; it also includes Sunnis, Shia and Kurds.  Weâre going to be working with our international partners to provide humanitarian assistance to those who are suffering in northern Iraq wherever we have capabilities and we can carry out effective missions like the one we carried out on Mount Sinjar without committing combat troops on the ground. 

We obviously feel a great urge to provide some humanitarian relief to the situation and Iâve been very encouraged by the interest of our international partners in helping on these kinds of efforts as well.  We will continue air strikes to protect our people and facilities in Iraq.  We have increased the delivery of military assistance to Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting ISIL on the front lines. 

And, perhaps most importantly, we are urging Iraqis to come together to turn the tide against ISIL -- above all, by seizing the enormous opportunity of forming a new, inclusive government under the leadership of Prime Minister-designate Abadi.  I had a chance to speak to Prime Minister-designate Abadi a few days ago, and he spoke about the need for the kind of inclusive government -- a government that speaks to all the people of Iraq -- that is needed right now.  He still has a challenging task in putting a government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction.

Now, second, I want to address something thatâs been in the news over the last couple of days and thatâs the situation in Ferguson, Missouri.  I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images weâve seen in the heartland of our country, as police have clashed with people protesting.  Today, Iâd like us all to take a step back and think about how weâre going to be moving forward.

This morning, I received a thorough update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been following it and been in communication with his team.  Iâve already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground. 

The Department of Justice is also consulting with local authorities about ways that they can maintain public safety without restricting the right of peaceful protest and while avoiding unnecessary escalation.  I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened, and to see that justice is done.

I also just spoke with Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri.  I expressed my concern over the violent turn that events have taken on the ground, and underscored that now is the time for all of us to reflect on whatâs happened, and to find a way to come together going forward.  He is going to be traveling to Ferguson.  He is a good man and a fine governor, and Iâm confident that, working together, he is going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way.

Of course, itâs important to remember how this started.  We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances.  He was 18 years old.  His family will never hold Michael in their arms again.  And when something like this happens, the local authorities -- including the police -- have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death, and how they are protecting the people in their communities.

There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.  Thereâs also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.  And here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.  Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority.

I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened.  There are going to be different accounts of how this tragedy occurred.  There are going to be differences in terms of what needs to happen going forward.  Thatâs part of our democracy.  But letâs remember that weâre all part of one American family.  We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law; a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest; a reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us; and the need for accountability when it comes to our government. 

So now is the time for healing.  Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.  Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.  And Iâve asked that the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney on the scene continue to work with local officials to move that process forward.  They will be reporting to me in the coming days about whatâs being done to make sure that happens. 

Thanks very much, everybody.
","The shooting death of an unarmed African-American teenager by a police officer turned into a national discourse on racial tension Tuesday as President Barack Obama urged people to remember Michael Brown ""through reflection and understanding.""

""I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions,"" Mr. Obama said in a statement. ""We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.""

The president's statement came after days of national news coverage of the 18-year-old's death. The shooting prompted peaceful protests as well as two nights of unrest, which led to broken windows and looting at several stores. Police responded by arresting several dozen people and firing tear gas to disperse the crowd Monday night.

Protesters said there is a history of tension between the African-American community in the St. Louis suburb and the mostly white police department. The city is about two-thirds black.

Demonstrators have been holding their arms in the air and chanting ""hands up, don't shoot"" when approaching police, based on media reports from purported witnesses that Mr. Brown had his hands up and was surrendering to officers when he was shot Saturday. The expression was popularized, in part, on Twitter and other social media.

Police have declined to say whether Mr. Brown had his hands up, citing the continuing investigation into the shooting. But they said there was a violent confrontation between Mr. Brown and the police officer just before the shooting.

Fueling protesters' concerns are conflicting accounts of what happened during the altercation. Police have said Mr. Brown allegedly assaulted the officer and the two struggled over his gun inside the officer's police car. A lawyer for Mr. Brown's family disputed that account.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the department wouldn't release the name of the officer involved in the shooting because of fears regarding his safety. He cited death threats sparked by recent postings on social media of the name of an officer who wasn't involved in the shooting.

""Officer safety is why we should reasonably not release that officer's name. It far outweighs the value of releasing the name,"" Mr. Jackson said. The officer is ""sad, and he's hurt. He's doing OK, but it's a difficult thing,"" he said.

The streets of the city of about 21,000 residents were calm Tuesday. Protesters gathered at the offices of St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch, whose office will receive the results of an investigation of the shooting being performed by St. Louis County police.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting its own probe into whether Mr. Brown's civil rights were violated.

Mr. Jackson, who said he doesn't expect the results of the county investigation for five weeks, attended a community meeting Tuesday night in an effort to ease tensions. The meeting included a question-and-answer session for a panel that also included the St. Louis County police chief.

""I want truth and I want justice,"" Mr. Jackson said at the town hall-style meeting, at Christ the King church. ""I want to be part of the solution. I want us all to be part of the solution.""

Earlier Tuesday, Steven Thomas, 23, stood on a street corner near where Mr. Brown died holding a banner containing an antigun slogan. ""There are places where we don't even want to go because we don't want to deal with the police,"" said the young African-American man, who is from St. Louis but has relatives here and visits often.

While the shooting has gained national attention, Maria Haberfeld, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said such incidents aren't on the rise. A combination of social media and recent high-profile cases such as the death of a New York City man, in part from a chokehold applied by a police officer, fuels a perception such cases have become widespread.

""There is no escalation in the use of deadly force. What we are seeing is a proliferation of cellphones and cameras,"" she said.

Mr. Jackson said it is difficult to recruit and retain minority officers to build a department that better reflects the makeup of the community.

Of 53 officers on the force, only three are African-American. ""We've lost a few African-Americans to higher paying departments,"" he said. ""The perception is that if we don't have the diversity, we don't have the understanding,"" Mr. Jackson said. ""And perception is reality.""
","The F.B.I. on Monday opened a civil rights inquiry into the fatal shooting by a police officer of an unarmed black teenager here as protests bubbled into a third night in this St. Louis suburb.

Officers donned riot gear and warily faced off against hundreds of people in response to looting and violence on Sunday night that resulted in 32 arrests.

On Monday night, police officers using tear gas and rubber bullets tried to disperse the crowd of mostly African-Americans, who had been gathering through the day under the hot sun. The protesters questioned the role that race -- and simmering tensions between residents and the Police Department -- may have played in the killing of Michael Brown, 18, who was to start college this week.

The standoff lasted for more than an hour, with about a dozen men approaching officers with their hands up saying, ""Don't shoot me."" At least 100 police officers were on the scene, shining bright lights into the crowd and telling people to return to their homes.

At one point, the sound of gunfire was heard from within the area where the police had barricaded streets in Ferguson. Earlier in the night, several people threw rocks at officers.

Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson police told The Associated Press that the officers used tear gas and shot ""beanbag rounds"" after members of the crowd threw rocks at officers and gunfire came from the crowd.

Chief Jackson said the police blocked off the area where most of the looting and vandalism occurred Sunday night out of concern that cars passing by might hit demonstrators in the street.

Brian Schellman, a public information officer with the St. Louis County police, said late Monday that the police had made several arrests for offenses including assaulting a police officer. He said they had no reports of injuries to the police or protesters. Officials have so far declined to identify the police officer who shot Mr. Brown or disclose his race. The officer was put on administrative leave.

""You have to begin with the frustration,"" said one of the protesters, Wayne Bledsoe of St. Louis. ""Treatment of these communities is not equal. In white communities, the police truly protect and serve. In black communities, that is not the case.""

The situation appeared to have calmed down by about 10:30 p.m. local time, the police said. A local news station aired footage of one man who was reportedly taken to a hospital for injuries from a rubber bullet.

Ferguson, a city of 21,000 northwest of St. Louis, has shifted substantially over the last decade, with blacks, once a minority, now making up two-thirds of the residents, after many white families moved out to surrounding suburbs. The town's leadership and the police have remained predominantly white.

In 2013, the suspension of a black superintendent of schools by an all-white school board stirred protests. And the Justice Department has a continuing investigation into racial disparities in legal representation for juveniles in Family Court.

""The community is still highly segregated,"" said Karen Knodt, interim pastor of the Immanuel United Church of Christ, whose congregation has 800 members, only four of whom are black. ""The institutions of power don't yet reflect the changing demographics of the county.""

At a news conference on Monday, Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief, who said his department was asked by the Ferguson police to take over the investigation of the shooting, pleaded for the public's patience.

""I understand that the public has a right to be skeptical, and I appreciate that and I would expect that the public be skeptical oftentimes of government or some forms of it,"" he said. ""But I would also ask the public to be reasonable, because it takes a long time to make sure we do this investigation the right way.""

On social media, reaction to Mr. Brown's killing was fierce, with many accusing the police of again shooting an unarmed black youth. It included a Twitter campaign called ""IfTheyGunnedMeDown"" prompted by a photograph of Mr. Brown that was used in some news reports about his killing. In the photo, Mr. Brown is shown with fingers of his right hand extended in what some considered a peace sign, while others called it a gang sign.

Mr. Brown's parents said at a news conference that he was nonviolent and good-natured, and would have objected to the looting. Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, compared the case to another one in which he represented a family, that of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old shot to death in Florida two years ago by a neighborhood watch coordinator.

""We need justice for our son,"" said Mr. Brown's father, Michael Brown, as his lawyer asked witnesses to step forward with testimony or videotape. ""If any of you have information, please give it to us,"" he said. ""We don't want no violence.""

""Because Michael wouldn't want no violence,"" said Lesley McSpadden, his mother, weeping.

The circumstances of Mr. Brown's death on Saturday afternoon as he and a friend walked from a convenience store were disputed. The police said he had hit the officer who shot him; his family and friends denied that.

In a local television interview, the friend who was walking with him, Dorian Johnson, said the officer opened fire when the young men refused to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk. He said Mr. Brown's hands were over his head. The autopsy showed Mr. Brown was shot a number of times.

The Ferguson police said they do not have videocameras running in their patrol cars. Residents of Ferguson said they were shaken by the unrest that swept the town on Sunday night, bringing 500 officers to the streets.

One school district nearby canceled classes on Monday, citing safety concerns. Many businesses refused to open or boarded up their windows as a protective measure. On West Florissant Street, the aftermath of Sunday's protest was still visible in a burned-out convenience store, the smashed windows of a thrift shop and lottery tickets that littered a parking lot.

""It was a miracle that no one was shot,"" Chief Belmar said of the looting.

Outside the Police Department, groups of residents criticized the police but also condemned the looting from the night before.

""We don't want any more violence around here,"" said Carolyn Teague, a nurse, as she wiped away tears. The tension, she said, had one source: ""Prejudice in this town still lives on.""

Patrice McHaskell, a teacher at a nursery school, said that in a town where the police force is mostly white and residents are mostly black, police officers have acquired a reputation for frequently stopping young black men, often for trivial things.

The shooting has tapped into longstanding resentments, she said: ""They're just outraged and they're tired of the police messing with them. It brought out all the anger and tension that everybody's been holding in.""

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. seemed to echo concerns from residents, saying in a statement on Monday that the episode ""deserves a fulsome review.""

He added, ""Aggressively pursuing investigations such as this is critical for preserving trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.""

The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department sometimes begins its own investigation into police departments that appear to show a pattern and practice of using excessive force, as it did this year in Albuquerque, after a series of shootings by the police involving people suffering from mental illness.

The shooting mobilized supporters, including Cornell Williams Brooks, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., who flew into St. Louis on Monday. He said he was committed to seeking justice.

""Note that he was nonviolent,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""If you want to honor his memory, honor his memory by seeking justice nonviolently.""

Charlie Dooley, the St. Louis County executive, cautioned that the local investigation would not come to a quick conclusion.

""This is a difficult and complex situation,"" he said. ""There are many sides to the story. There are many answers.""

73,73,2014-09-17-Ebola.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody.  Please be seated.  I want to thank Dr. Frieden and everybody here at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for welcoming me here today.  Tom and his team just gave me an update on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, our efforts to help mobilize the international community to fight it, and the steps that weâre taking to keep people here at home safe. 

Tom and his team are doing outstanding work.  Between the specialists they have on the ground in West Africa and here at headquarters, theyâve got hundreds of professionals who are working tirelessly on this issue.  This is the largest international response in the history of the CDC.  After this, Iâll be meeting with some of these men and women, including some who recently returned from the front lines of the outbreak.  And they represent public service at its very best.  And so I just want them to know how much the American people appreciate them.  Many of them are serving far away from home, away from their families.  They are doing heroic work and serving in some unbelievably challenging conditions -- working through exhaustion, day and night, and many have volunteered to go back.  So we are very, very proud of them.

Their work and our efforts across the government is an example of what happens when America leads in confronting some major global challenges.  Faced with this outbreak, the world is looking to us, the United States, and itâs a responsibility that we embrace.  Weâre prepared to take leadership on this to provide the kinds of capabilities that only America has, and to mobilize the world in ways that only America can do.  Thatâs what weâre doing as we speak. 

First and foremost, I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.  Weâve been taking the necessary precautions, including working with countries in West Africa to increase screening at airports so that someone with the virus doesnât get on a plane for the United States.  In the unlikely event that someone with Ebola does reach our shores, weâve taken new measures so that weâre prepared here at home.  Weâre working to help flight crews identify people who are sick, and more labs across our country now have the capacity to quickly test for the virus.  Weâre working with hospitals to make sure that they are prepared, and to ensure that our doctors, our nurses and our medical staff are trained, are ready, and are able to deal with a possible case safely.

And here Iâve got to commend everybody at Emory University Hospital.  I just had the opportunity to meet with Doctors Gartland and Ribner and members of their team and the nurses who -- sorry, doctors, but having been in hospitals, I know -- theyâre the ones really doing the work.  And I had a chance to thank them for their extraordinary efforts in helping to provide care for the first Americans who recently contracted the disease in Africa.  The first two of those patients were released last month and continue to improve.  And itâs a reminder for the American people that, should any cases appear in the United States, we have world-class facilities and professionals ready to respond.  And we have effective surveillance mechanisms in place.  

I should mention, by the way, that I had a chance to see Dr. Brantly in the Oval Office this morning.  And although he is still having to gain back some weight, he looks great.  He looks strong and we are incredibly grateful to him and his family for the service that he has rendered to people who are a lot less lucky than all of us.

As we all know, however, West Africa is facing a very different situation, especially in the hardest hit countries:  Liberia, Sierra Leone, and in Guinea.  Tom and others recently returned from the region, and the scenes that they describe are just horrific.  More than 2,400 men, women and children are known to have died -- and we strongly suspect that the actual death toll is higher than that.  Hospitals, clinics and the few treatment centers that do exist have been completely overwhelmed.  An already very weak public health system is near collapse in these countries.  Patients are being turned away, and people are literally dying in the streets.

Now, hereâs the hard truth:  In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not seen before.  Itâs spiraling out of control.  It is getting worse.  Itâs spreading faster and exponentially.  Today, thousands of people in West Africa are infected.  That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands.  And if the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected, with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us.  So this is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security -- itâs a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic.  That has profound effects on all of us, even if we are not directly contracting the disease.

And thatâs why, two months ago, I directed my team to make this a national security priority.  Weâre working this across our entire government, which is why today Iâm joined by leaders throughout my administration, including from my national security team. 

And weâve devoted significant resources in support of our strategy with four goals in mind.  Number one, to control the outbreak.  Number two, to address the ripple effects of local economies and communities to prevent a truly massive humanitarian disaster.  Number three, to coordinate a broader global response.  And number four, to urgently build up a public health system in these countries for the future -- not just in West Africa but in countries that donât have a lot of resources generally.

Now, this is a daunting task.  But hereâs what gives us hope.  The world knows how to fight this disease.  Itâs not a mystery.  We know the science.  We know how to prevent it from spreading.  We know how to care for those who contract it.  We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives.  But we have to act fast.  We canât dawdle on this one.  We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we had not seen before.   

So today, Iâm announcing a major increase in our response.  At the request of the Liberian government, weâre going to establish a military command center in Liberia to support civilian efforts across the region -- similar to our response after the Haiti earthquake.  Itâs going to be commanded by Major General Darryl Williams, commander of our Army forces in Africa.  He just arrived today and is now on the ground in Liberia.  And our forces are going to bring their expertise in command and control, in logistics, in engineering.  And our Department of Defense is better at that, our Armed Services are better at that than any organization on Earth. 

Weâre going to create an air bridge to get health workers and medical supplies into West Africa faster.  Weâre going to establish a staging area in Senegal to help distribute personnel and aid on the ground more quickly.  We are going to create a new training site to train thousands of health workers so they can effectively and safely care for more patients.  Personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service will deploy to the new field hospitals that weâre setting up in Liberia.  And USAID will join with international partners and local communities in a Community Care Campaign to distribute supplies and information kits to hundreds of thousands of families so they can better protect themselves. 

Weâre also going to build additional treatment units, including new isolation spaces and more than 1,000 beds.  And in all our efforts, the safety of our personnel will remain a top priority.  Meanwhile, our scientists continue their urgent research in the hope of finding new treatments and perhaps vaccines.  And today Iâm calling on Congress to approve the funding that weâve requested so that we can carry on with all these critical efforts.     

Today, the United States is doing even more.  But this is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response.  International organizations just have to move faster than they have up until this point.  More nations need to contribute experienced personnel, supplies, and funding thatâs needed, and they need to deliver on what they pledge quickly.  Charities and individual philanthropists have given generously, and they can make a big difference.  And so weâre not restricting these efforts to governmental organizations; we also need NGOs and private philanthropies to work with us in a coordinated fashion in order to maximize the impact of our response. 

This week, the United States will chair an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.  Next week, Iâll join U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to continue mobilizing the international community around this effort.  And then, at the White House, weâre going to bring more nations together to strengthen our global health security so that we can better prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics. 

This is actually something that we had announced several months ago at the G7 meeting.  We determined that this has to be a top priority; this was before the Ebola outbreak.  We anticipated the fact that in many of these countries with a weak public health system, if we donât have more effective surveillance, more effective facilities on the ground, and are not helping poor countries in developing their ability to catch these things quickly, that there was at least the potential of seeing these kinds of outbreaks.  And sadly, we now see that our predictions were correct.  It gives more urgency to this effort -- a global health initiative -- that we have been pushing internationally.    

Let me just close by saying this:  The scenes that weâre witnessing in West Africa today are absolutely gut-wrenching.  In one account over the weekend, we read about a family in Liberia.  The disease had already killed the father.  The mother was cradling a sick and listless five-year-old son.  Her other son, 10-years-old, was dying, too.  They finally reached a treatment center but they couldnât get in.  And, said a relative, âWe are just sitting.â 

These men and women and children are just sitting, waiting to die, right now.  And it doesnât have to be this way.     

The reality is that this epidemic is going to get worse before it gets better.  But right now, the world still has an opportunity to save countless lives.  Right now, the world has the responsibility to act -- to step up, and to do more.  The United States of America intends to do more.  We are going to keep leading in this effort.  Weâre going to do our part, and weâre going to continue to make sure that the world understands the need for them to step alongside us as well in order for us to not just save the lives of families like the one I just discussed, but ultimately, to make sure that this doesnât have the kinds of spillover effects that become even more difficult to control.

So thank you very much to the entire team thatâs already doing this work.  And please know that youâve got your President and Commander-in-Chief behind you. 

Thank you.
","The world is finally mobilizing to wage a muscular fight against Ebola's catastrophic spread through West Africa. President Obama has put the Pentagon in charge of a robust, 3,000-person U.S. relief effort in the stricken areas. This is a positive step, but the world is still dangerously ill-prepared for the fight against pandemic outbreaks.

In the case of Ebola, we were late to the battle and are now focused too narrowly on places like Liberia while failing to see West Africa as one big outbreak. We also remain too dependent on outdated tools and strategies in fighting the virus, and are tethered to an effort not yet scaled to the challenge.

While Ebola may still be contained, other potentially calamitous threats are out there. MERS, SARS, avian flu and other illnesses could re-emerge at any time. In the American Midwest, for instance, a novel virus classified as Enterovirus 68 has recently sent some 300 children to the hospital in respiratory distress, with no available antiviral therapy or vaccine. We need to rethink our preparedness and adopt a more modern approach for dealing with these and other looming outbreaks.

The failure thus far to confront and fight Ebola comes from shortfalls in three areas: gauging the true scope of the outbreak, deploying therapeutics to effectively combat the virus, and delivering medical equipment and personnel. Fixing these limitations should be the priority in dealing with this epidemic and the next one.

First, on detection: Fighting deadly diseases requires early detection and a clear understanding of the magnitude of an evolving threat. In West Africa we drastically underestimated the timing and scope of Ebola's transmission and still can't accurately measure the magnitude of its spread.

Ebola is not the only modern instance of the world coming up short. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, health organizations were slow to detect the emergence of a problem in Mexico. Even after press reports that Mexico was experiencing a ""late flu season,"" public-health officials failed to grasp that a novel infection was coursing through that country and would soon arrive in the U.S.

Using new screening technologies and innovative detection approaches as simple as spikes in Google searches that indicate health anomalies, we can better sound the alarm of a pandemic threat. We also need to develop better coordinated, real-time responses among national health bureaucracies that are often slow to respond and do not communicate effectively among one another.

Second, on therapeutics: In 2004 Congress passed Project Bioshield to finance the development and stockpiling of medical countermeasures against the likely agents of would-be bioterrorists. This effort was augmented in 2013 with the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act. Other measures have been targeted at tropical diseases, and all of these efforts have improved our biological readiness, but dangerous gaps remain.

One problem is that federal grants are awarded to offset the direct costs of development and manufacturing of medical countermeasures but not the true cost of risk-taking to develop novel approaches. The Bioshield grants, for example, are used by some small biotechs to offset the costs of existing drug programs. Many companies repurpose drugs they already have on the shelf toward biodefense uses, hoping that their product might eventually make it into government stockpiles, generating a bigger return.

The program doesn't provide for market-based rewards for innovation and risk-taking. As a result, companies are still reluctant to make the substantial investments needed to develop new medical countermeasures. To take one example, as far back as 2000 the National Institutes of Health announced the development of ""a novel vaccine that prevents Ebola virus infection in monkeys."" Yet the 2014 Ebola crisis struck without a vaccine available for humans.

The challenge is that there's no natural market for therapeutics aimed at bioterrorism or rare diseases, other than government stockpiling. To these ends, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority should develop a more explicit, prize-based system to offer market-based rewards for programs that successfully develop new countermeasures to national security risks. Grants could offset the direct costs of research and manufacturing, with prizes providing the requisite return.

Third, logistics: The World Health Organization's failed response to the Ebola crisis shows anew that the group is more a politically minded policy-making body than a relief agency. The WHO claims that it lacked the resources to respond to Ebola, but while the outbreak was spiraling out of control in West Africa, the organization had plenty of time and money to mount an international campaign to combat what it flagged last month as a ""grave concern."" Not Ebola, but electronic cigarettes.

We need to create an off-the-shelf logistical enterprise capable of inserting public-health resources to snuff out contagious threats that have pandemic potential. Such a capability might reside with the United Nations, or better, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, so that when a deadly virus emerges in developing areas the U.S. and its allies can control its spread before it hits major population areas. We need to think about the same issue domestically as well. If the Ebola pandemic were to come to the U.S., it is unclear who would lead the response: The Department of Health and Human Services has the expertise, but the Defense Department and Homeland Security have the assets.

Ebola shows the danger of diseases developing and spreading around the world from a key convergence point. As Richard Preston wrote in his 1994 nonfiction best-seller ""The Hot Zone,"" when a novel virus emerges, the warning sign may be a series of small outbreaks at different times and places. These ""microbreaks"" can eventually re-emerge like Ebola has and become a pandemic. How many Ebola microbreaks were missed or not taken seriously? And how many other lethal pathogens -- from MERS to SARS to Enterovirus 68 -- are we too casual about today?

The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general just issued a highly critical report finding that DHS lacks sufficient supplies and preparedness to handle a domestic pandemic. Thirteen years ago, soon after the 9/11 attacks, letters laced with anthrax killed five Americans. Just as 9/11 revealed the country's vulnerabilities to terror attacks, the anthrax episode exposed the need for better routine surveillance and strategic stockpiling of key countermeasures against viral outbreaks or bioterror attacks. We're still far less prepared than we should be, and far more vulnerable than we're admitting.
","President Obama on Tuesday challenged world powers to accelerate the global response to the Ebola outbreak that is ravaging West Africa, warning that unless health care workers, medical equipment and treatment centers were swiftly deployed, the disease could take hundreds of thousands of lives.

""This epidemic is going to get worse before it gets better,"" Mr. Obama said here at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where he met with doctors who had just returned from West Africa. The world, he said, ""has the responsibility to act, to step up and to do more. The United States intends to do more.""

Even as the president announced a major American deployment to Liberia and Senegal of medicine, equipment and 3,000 military personnel, global health officials said that time was running out and that they had weeks, not months, to act. They said that although the American contribution was on a scale large enough to make a difference, a coordinated assault in Africa from other Western powers was essential to bringing the virus under control.

""Everyone realizes that no one group or one country or one organization is going to be able to tackle this,"" Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank and an expert in infectious diseases, said in a telephone interview hours after the bank's board unanimously approved a $105 million grant as part of its previously announced assistance to the most affected of the countries. He praised the American effort as ""extremely encouraging,"" but said it remained unclear how the United States would coordinate its effort with relief groups. ""This is all being put together on the fly,"" he said.

Administration officials said they urgently needed stronger responses from Britain and France, countries that, along with the United States, have colonial ties to the three hardest-hit African countries: Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

So far, France has sent $13 million to Guinea for two tons of medical equipment and the construction of medical centers, and $15.5 million and 24 doctors to Senegal and Ivory Coast, other former French colonies. British troops, the government said last week, are headed to Sierra Leone, a former British colony, to build and staff a 63-bed facility near the capital, Freetown.

On Tuesday night, administration officials said the Pentagon would ask Congress to redirect $500 million from existing Defense Department funds to fight Ebola. The money is in addition to $500 million the Pentagon requested last week in redirected funds for both Iraq and Ebola.

In Washington, New York and Geneva, health experts expressed astonishment and alarm at the virus's rapid spread.

""The pace of the disease and also its impact have taken our breath away -- it's been that massive,"" said Shanelle Hall, director of the supply division at Unicef, which has sent about 550 tons of supplies to West Africa in the past several weeks and has plans to almost triple that amount by the beginning of next month. ""We hope other governments also come in with commensurate levels of support.""

On Capitol Hill, Dr. Beth P. Bell, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the C.D.C., told a Senate hearing that although Ebola did not currently pose a significant public health threat to the United States, ""there is a window of opportunity to control the spread of this disease, but that window is closing.""

At the United Nations, the Security Council prepared to convene for a rare emergency meeting on Thursday to mobilize a response. It also took action on a global health issue in 2000 and 2011, when it passed resolutions on AIDS.

Senior United Nations officials said in Geneva that cases of the disease were rising at an almost exponential rate, with the number of reported cases now at 4,985, including 2,461 deaths. Half of the infections, according to Dr. Bruce Aylward, an assistant director general of the World Health Organization, occurred in the past 21 days, underscoring the acceleration of the outbreak. ""We don't know where the numbers are going with this,"" Dr. Aylward said at a news conference.

Mr. Obama echoed those words. ""We can't dawdle on this one,"" the president said. ""We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we had not seen before.""

But just how fast the American military can build 17 treatment centers of 100 beds each in Liberia, as planned, is still in question. Liberian officials say 1,000 beds are needed there in the next week alone to contain the disease. American military officials cautioned that they were not close to getting that number of beds up and running and said it would take time -- perhaps as long as two weeks -- before personnel arrived to begin setting up the first treatment centers.

Defense Department officials said that once constructed, the treatment centers would be turned over to Liberia and staffed by local and international health care providers, although health care experts say they are having difficulty finding doctors. A small number of American physicians and nurses are among the 3,000 military personnel en route to Liberia and Senegal, but administration officials said they would serve as trainers to other health care workers.

Some health experts said the president's plan focused too much on Liberia and not enough on Guinea and Sierra Leone. ""An uneven response in the region may trigger unintended flows of people seeking care from American centers,"" said Dr. Jack Chow, a professor of global health at Carnegie Mellon University and a former official at the World Health Organization.

But in Liberia, half a year after the start of the outbreak, the authorities remain incapable of carrying out the most basic steps needed to stop the spread of Ebola, including picking up the dead and isolating potentially infectious people. In the capital, bodies are often left in houses and neighborhoods for up to three days before they are taken away by burial teams. Because of a shortage of ambulances, families with visibly sick relatives take taxis to full treatment centers, where they are often turned away.

As Ebola spread through the capital last month, Liberia's government initially asserted control over the fight against the virus, even placing an entire slum in Monrovia under quarantine, against international advice. But facing a deteriorating situation on the ground and increasing pressure by politicians and the news media to ""outsource"" the battle, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf wrote to Mr. Obama and the leaders of China, Russia and several other countries asking for direct help.

Because of Liberia's historical ties to the United States -- it was founded by freed American slaves in 1822 -- a visible American military presence would not draw the kind of backlash it would elsewhere in Africa.

On Tuesday, many in Monrovia welcomed news of greater American involvement. ""It will help us,"" said the Rev. Otis Borbor, the pastor at the Lighthouse Assemblies of God church in Caldwell, one of Monrovia's most affected neighborhoods. ""That's what we were praying for, the pastors. We were praying to God that he may send people to rescue us and carry help to the country. So when we heard that, we were happy.""

74,74,2014-10-18-ConsumerFinancialProtection.txt,"Good job, everybody.  Everybody, please have a seat.  Well, it is good to be back at CFPB.

Yes, this is an enthusiastic and rowdy crowd, this group.  Thatâs what happens when you do good things -- you feel good.  And this group is doing great work.

I want to thank your director, Rich Cordray, for hosting me here today, and I want to thank all of you for doing a great job in looking out for the financial security of all Americans.

Now, obviously, right now the news is dominated by Ebola, and weâve got an all-hands-on-deck approach across government to make sure that we are keeping the American people safe.  But even as we meet that particular challenge, itâs also important that we donât lose sight of the other challenges that we face as a nation, especially the challenge of making sure that our economy works for every single American.  And that includes the challenge that brings me here today:  protecting Americans from financial fraud and identity theft.

As President, I believe that America is stronger when our middle class can count on things like affordable health insurance, and Medicare and Social Security, where there are rules to protect our kids from dirty air or dirty water; rules to protect consumers from being taken advantage of.  And I know you agree, those of you at CFPB, because thatâs your mission.

And thatâs why part of the financial reform that we passed in the wake of the worse financial crisis since the Great Depression was the creation of this agency, to make sure that we are looking at every aspect of the financial system and ensuring that the American people have the basic protections that they should be able to count on.  You have one mission:  Youâre a watchdog for consumers to make sure that the American people have somebody whoâs got their backs.

And because of the good work of many of the people who are here today, Americans have saved millions because theyâve been protected from predatory mortgage practices.  Youâve protected folks from deceptive credit card practices.  Youâve set up âKnow Before You Oweâ to help college be a little more affordable for young people and to make sure that they know the kind of debt that theyâre accruing.  Youâve simplified mortgage forms so homeowners donât get tricked in the final print.  But all this work, taken together, the reason itâs important is because itâs not an abstraction; it saves people money and time and heartache.

And before you, Americans who had gotten taken advantage of often had no way of achieving some sort of compensation.  Today, youâve actually secured billions of dollars in relief for victims.  Youâve helped to make people a little more whole after somebody engaged in fraudulent behavior.

Some folks in Congress fought tooth and nail to keep this agency from getting off the ground.  There are some, frankly, who are still fighting to undo the rules we put in place to protect consumers.  But I refuse to back down and go back to the days when mortgage lenders or financial firms could take advantage of consumers, and consumers had no recourse.  Weâre moving forward.  America is better because of this agency and because of the rules that weâve put in place.

And the good news is, is that weâve got more work to do.  And today, weâre building on the progress thatâs already been made by announcing new measures to protect America from identity theft and fraud.

Now, weâve all experienced the benefits of new technologies that let us buy and sell things faster and more efficiently than ever before.  But there are risks that come with these technologies as well.  Last year, millions of Americans became victims of identity theft.  Millions were victims of this kind of fraud.  More than 100 million Americans had information that was compromised in data breaches in some of our largest companies.  And identity theft is now Americaâs fastest-growing crime.

These crimes donât just cost companies and consumers billions of dollars every year, they also threaten the economic security of middle-class Americans who have worked really hard for a lifetime to build some sort of security.  The idea that somebody halfway around the world could run up thousands of dollars in charges in your name just because they stole your number, or because you swiped your card at the wrong place in the wrong time, thatâs infuriating.  For victims, itâs heartbreaking.  And as a country, weâve got to do more to stop it.

And thatâs why today we are launching an initiative called âBuy Secureâ -- because you should be able to buy the things that you need without risking your identity, your credit score, or your savings.

First, starting next year, weâre going to begin making sure that credit cards and credit-card readers issued by the United States government come equipped with two new layers of protection:  a microchip in the card thatâs harder for thieves to clone than a magnetic strip, and a pin number you enter into the reader just as you do with an ATM.  We know this technology works.  When Britain switched to a chip-and-pin system, they cut fraud in stores by 70 percent.  Seventy percent.

Of course, no one security measure, no matter how powerful, can stop fraud on its own.  So today, Iâm also directing federal law enforcement to share more information with the private sector when they discover identity theft rings.

Folks here at the CFPB are working with banks to help make it easier for consumers to discover if fraudulent charges have been made to their account.  The Federal Trade Commission will add new features to IdentityTheft.gov, and theyâre going to work with credit bureaus to dramatically cut down on the time it takes for victims to recover their stolen identities.  And in the coming months Iâll be bringing together industry leaders and consumer advocates for a cybersecurity summit focused on protecting consumers using the next generation of mobile payment systems and devices.

And Iâm happy to say that the private sector is already deeply engaged in this effort.  Today, a group of retailers that include some of our largest -- Home Depot, Target, Walgreens, Walmart -- and representing more than 15,000 stores across the country, all of them are pledging to adopt chip-and-pin technology by the beginning of next year.  American Express is pledging $10 million to replace outdated card readers at small businesses.  MasterCard is pledging to provide its customers with free identity-theft monitoring and resolution support.  And Citi is joining other financial institutions in making free FICO scores available to customers, because a sudden drop in your credit rating is one of the clearest signs that youâve been hit by fraud.

So I want to thank all the business leaders who are choosing to protect their companies and their customers from the kind of hacking that we saw too many times this past year.  I want to encourage every retailer, every bank, and every credit card company to join them in this effort.

And even though Iâm taking action today without Congress, Congress needs to do its part, as well.  Today, data breaches are handled by dozens of separate state laws, and itâs time to have one clear national standard that brings certainty to businesses and keeps consumers safe.

Let me just close by saying this.  Last week, I saw a survey that asked folks from all over the world what they thought of the idea that âsuccess in life is pretty much determined by forces outside of our control.â  Of all the advanced economies on Earth, Americans, as you might expect, were the least likely to agree with that.  We think our fate is in our own hands.  We think that if we work hard, that we can get ahead.  For all the challenges of the 21st century, for all the tough, grueling work that's been required to rebuild this economy and people rebuilding their individual lives after a terrible recession, we still believe that our destiny is written by us -- not for us.  We believe that this is a country where hard work should pay off and responsibility should be rewarded.

Thatâs the principle all of you here at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau deeply believe in.  That's what you're fighting for every single day.  That's what Iâm going to keep fighting for as long as I have the opportunity to be President.  And the executive order Iâm signing and the great work that the companies are doing who are participating here today is going to just be one more brick in that bridge that we provide to hopefully all Americans so that they can translate their dreams into reality.

So good job, everybody.  Let me sign this.1

Rich, I should mention, by the way, that I went to a restaurant up in New York when I was there during the General Assembly, and my credit card was rejected.  It turned out I guess I don't use it enough.  So they thought there was some fraud going on.  Fortunately, Michelle had hers.  And I was trying to explain to the waitress, no, I really think that Iâve been paying my bills.  Even Iâm affected by this.

Thank you very much, everybody.
","Jeb Hensarling may be the most important Republican elected official you've never heard of. He will become even more important if his party wins control of the U.S. Senate in November's elections, two weeks from this Tuesday. He's also a leading candidate to eventually succeed John Boehner as House speaker.

So it's a good moment to sit down with the Texan, who represents a district near Dallas and is now chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, to talk about the political possibilities and strategy. He believes the GOP is ""poised for a good election"" but not a great one. Good because President Obama is ineffectual and unpopular. Not great because Republicans haven't talked enough about their plans to encourage job creation and rising incomes.

But if Republicans do win a majority, count Mr. Hensarling among those who think they will have to do more than stymie Mr. Obama for his final two years. They'll have to produce legislation, he says, putting bills on the president's desk that he will have to sign or veto. The political trick will be calculating what to pass that Mr. Obama might conceivably sign, and what to pass anyway to educate the country and prepare for the 2016 election.

Together with Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), who is expected to become chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Hensarling will drive economic policy in the House. A cerebral veteran lawmaker who opposed the bank bailouts, he carries the respect of both tea party conservatives and establishment moderates within the GOP.

He'll need that credibility because he is aggressive in sketching out a 2015 legislative agenda for faster economic growth. The common theme he stresses with Journal editors is liberating people from bureaucracy, whether they are seeking a mortgage, buying health insurance, crossing America's southern border to make an honest living in the U.S. or simply filling out their tax returns.

This last one provides an opportunity to liberate Americans from billions of hours of unproductive labor. ""Nothing says economic growth like fundamental tax reform,"" says Mr. Hensarling. The idea is to slash tax rates, along with loopholes, to enact a simpler, more user-friendly tax system.

Contrary to much Washington wisdom, including among conservative pundits, he says tax reform is possible in 2015 not only because the IRS is in such ill repute, but also because Republicans will have no excuse for inaction if they control both houses of Congress. ""It's a put-up or shut-up moment for us,"" he says.

An early gut check for Republican reformers will come next year when Congress will decide whether to once again reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, a monument to crony capitalism that provides cheap financing for selected international trade deals.

Mr. Hensarling views the Ex-Im battle ""somewhat as a precursor to the tax reform fight because there are so many vested corporate interests"" served by the current tax code: ""If we can't get rid of this agency and the corporate welfare it represents, how will House Republicans ever muster the intestinal fortitude to be able to do fundamental tax reform?"" He adds, with some political poignancy, ""I don't know how we will ever have the moral authority to deal with social welfare if we can't deal with corporate welfare.""

On the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Hensarling has been quietly crafting bipartisan reform bills that now lie buried in Majority Leader Harry Reid's Democratic Senate. But if Republicans control the upper chamber after November, Mr. Hensarling suddenly will have someone to work with, probably Alabama's Richard Shelby, who is expected to become chairman of the Banking Committee in a GOP Senate.

Mr. Hensarling sees an opportunity to revisit the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, which was drafted in haste after the financial crisis and was falsely promoted as an end to too-big-to-fail banks. Mr. Hensarling says that ""given the state of the economy, people are taking a second look"" at both the law and the story they were sold by its authors. ""We've all heard about Wall Street greed. I think people are now starting to be a little bit more sensitized to Washington greed -- the greed for power and control over our lives and our economy.""

He notes that consumers aren't pleased with the results: Free checking and credit-card perks are disappearing, and more generally the economy is lagging. Mr. Obama's approval ratings on economic policy are down, and Mr. Hensarling thinks one reason is the burden on lending and small community banks by Dodd-Frank's ""sheer weight, volume, complexity and number of regulations.""

He is particularly focused on the law's Financial Stability Oversight Council -- which can vote to rescue certain huge corporations it deems ""systemically important"" -- and on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which he calls ""the single most unaccountable agency in the history of America."" Housed within the Federal Reserve, it draws funding from the Fed but doesn't answer to any Fed officials, or to congressional appropriators, or to a bipartisan commission, as most independent agencies do. The bureau is run by a single director who cannot be removed unless the president can show cause.

Mr. Hensarling also notes that the Bureau doesn't even have true oversight by the courts because of the Supreme Court's Chevron legal doctrine that compels judges to show deference to the bureau's decisions. This lack of accountability may be why the bureau has been constructing what Mr. Hensarling calls ""the Taj Mahal"" to serve as its Beltway headquarters.

Mr. Hensarling believes the CFPB's lack of accountability is also leading to ""consumer protections"" that Americans don't want or need. Once the bureau's rules are fully implemented, he says, ""one third of all blacks and Hispanics"" will ""no longer be able to buy the homes that they have traditionally been able to buy. We are protecting them out of their homes! The qualified-mortgage rule should have been called 'quitting mortgages' because that's what it's all about. So I think I've got the argument that is very compelling and people feel it,"" says Mr. Hensarling. ""They're less free and less prosperous.""

Does this put him in the company of affordable-housing advocates who favor degraded underwriting standards for politically favored demographic groups?

""Possibly, yes,"" he says. ""I don't want degraded standards. I want market standards. I don't want government fiat standards. I don't want one view coming out of Washington on what acceptable mortgage risk is."" Because, he adds, that view is guaranteed to be wrong.

Will he try to put a repeal of the CFPB on Mr. Obama's desk next year? ""It would be a very different CFPB,"" he replies. ""I want government to vigorously police our markets"" and it's not necessarily a bad idea to have this function centralized in one department. ""What is bad is giving an unelected, unaccountable bureaucrat the unilateral power to essentially decide what credit cards go in our wallets, what mortgages we can have on our homes, which is exactly what CFPB is doing.""

What about the stability council in Dodd-Frank? Would a GOP Congress vote to repeal it?

""I would hope so,"" Mr. Hensarling says, and he expects such a plan would enjoy ""a little more bipartisan buy-in."" He's willing to seek whatever reforms to the law can attract 60 votes in the Senate. ""Absolutely, whatever the market will bear. I came here to make a difference, not to make a speech,"" he says. He'd like to combine a repeal of this big-bank rescuer with a new bankruptcy plan for large financial firms crafted by the House Judiciary Committee, along with requirements that banks hold more capital.

In fact, he's already agreed with liberal Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters on dozens of modest reforms to financial laws that provide regulatory relief, even though the two lawmakers ""come fairly close to representing ideological bookends of the United States House of Representatives.""

He's particularly optimistic about being able to lessen the bureaucratic load on small banks next year. And he thinks a housing-finance reform that ends the dominant role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is possible as well, provided Democrats don't demand ""another affordable housing slush fund on steroids.""

But why would Democrats cooperate with any of this, given the political benefit they seem to see in blaming Republicans for obstructing the president's agenda? ""I don't think that is selling like it once did,"" he says. ""I don't want to hurt their careers so they shall remain nameless, but there are a number of Democrats on my committee who have indicated an interest in working on certain issues. It's always a tough thing to do, and a lot of times you don't want to do it unless you think that ultimately you can make a difference because you end up taking flak from your party.""

He adds that ""there are some Democrats on that committee that have done some pretty good work on some issues. Now they still tend to vote the party line because they don't think this would see the light of day and thus it is not worth the risk for them to step out, but they're there.""

Beyond Mr. Hensarling's committee, he says the GOP agenda next year should include ""making ObamaCare optional."" And the Texan would like to see immigration reform that allows more H-1B visas for high-tech workers and also creates a ""vibrant guest-worker program"" for low-skill workers who want to come here to work in agriculture for example.

He also favors more border security but says that doesn't mean a physical wall is required over the entire length of our southern border. He believes a good guest-worker program is a form of border security because it allows law enforcement to focus on catching criminals and terrorists: ""Less hay to find the needles."" This focus on immigration's economic benefits is consistent with his free-market principles, though it puts him at odds with the drift of many Republicans who are falling for the fallacy that there are a finite number of jobs in the country and every immigrant robs a job from someone already here. Mr. Hensarling acknowledges the drift but thinks a GOP Congress would still be able to move piecemeal immigration reform to Mr. Obama's desk.

Mr. Hensarling recounts walking at his local July Fourth parade this year and noticing a woman come running at him from the curb. As a public official he's learned this ""is either a very good thing or a very bad thing."" But she had a smile on her face and said in a thick accent, ""I had to learn your name for my citizenship test and I've always wanted to meet you.""

When he asked where she was from, the woman said, ""Russia. And I love freedom.""

""Welcome home,"" he replied.
","A mother of five children in Bath, Me., admitted on the New York Times's Motherlode blog earlier this year that she and her husband had no college savings. Their son, a high school junior, was about to leave for a college tour with some leftover Easter eggs for food, a tent and his one good pair of pants.

The essay, by Meadow Rue Merrill, struck a nerve. Many commenters blamed her and her husband for spending money on after-school enrichment instead of saving for college. With an income in the mid-five figures, however, there was never going to be much excess.

I wondered what the Merrills would say to their children about the lack of funds, and I wrote my own post with some suggestions. But there is a different tactical question that faces this family and many others like it now: What should they actually do once senior year arrives and there are no college savings?

Their numbers are almost certainly growing. In just a generation or two, we've gone from students working their way through college without too much trouble, to many parents still being able to write checks to cover tuition out of current income, to sticker prices being so high that two decades of savings may not be enough to cover two children from relatively affluent families.

The uncomfortable reality of paying for college is often compounded by a noxious combination of parental confusion, compressed time periods and teenage uncertainty. After all, it's hard to predict what sort of discounts you might get come springtime based on your financial need or your child's academic or athletic merit, plus it's nearly impossible to know how your child's needs might change between the ages of 17 and 22. Nevertheless, families stagger into senior year and try to make one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives.

THE DATA For families with little or nothing saved, the process has to begin with a crash course in how colleges make decisions about financial aid. First, you'll want to use the calculator on the College Board's website that estimates your expected family contribution, the number that the federal government will use in figuring out how much federal aid you are eligible for once you fill out the Fafsa (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form later in a child's senior year in high school. Colleges will also use this number, with additional tweaks in some cases, as a baseline for what you can pay each year, though it's no guarantee that they'll make up the difference with grants or work-study jobs and not a link to a bunch of loan applications.

After that, you can use the federal government's College Navigator site to figure out a school's average cost of attendance, which breaks out room and board and other expenses. That site also has the crucial ""net price"" information, broken down by family income, which shows what an average student actually pays after the subtraction of scholarships from the original number. Colleges maintain their own net price calculators as well, where you can input your financial data to get a rough sense of the amount of aid they might award you. The quality of these calculators can vary.

Want to get a sense of how much a school might give away in merit aid -- the money that is based on an applicant's record and not financial need? Lynn O'Shaughnessy, who writes and teaches courses through a site called The College Solution, suggests using a site called collegedata.com. She has a video on YouTube that explains exactly how to milk the merit data out of the site. Then follow up with each school for more on minimum qualifications.

You are probably not going to get rewarded for having saved nothing. Everyone seems to know a family in their area with a big house, fancy passport stamps and no savings with a child who nevertheless got an amazing financial aid package from a top school. Don't believe the stories. The details of financial aid are so complex that many families don't understand their own packages, or the rumormongers transmit the details incorrectly. Income tends to matter in financial aid more than assets and savings, especially at public universities.

THE COLLEGES Most families with no savings will be hoping that at least some colleges they apply to will offer large grants and ask them to borrow less money than others. But popular, highly ranked schools tend to have a lot of applicants. Even if you do get in, many of them may not offer outsize rewards or be flexible if you appeal for more money once you get in. Apply and cross your fingers, but don't count on generosity here unless the school is particularly well endowed.

Parents with no savings and higher incomes need to be more strategic, encouraging their children to apply to at least some colleges where they would be among the very best students. Those institutions may offer more grants in an effort to enhance the quality of their student body. ""I can't say it's an impossible scenario,"" said David Gelinas, the director of financial aid at Davidson College. ""But we would always want people to apply to schools where they know they would be comfortable and not in the hope that they will throw more cash at them.""

Now that Ms. Merrill's son is looking at his list of private Christian colleges, public universities near home and a few name-brand liberal arts colleges that have sent him solicitations, she's blanching at the possibility of pressing the send button over and over again and hoping that one of the financial aid forms turns into a lottery ticket. ""It may be better for him, but it seems like a system falling apart if that's what you have to do to get where you want to go,"" she said. ""I'm just not sure I'm willing to play that game.""

For those who are and aim to declare the highest-bidding college the winner come April, Kevin McKinley, a financial adviser in Eau Claire, Wis., offers a word of warning: Ask if the scholarships are guaranteed for all of the years of attendance. ""Good luck trying to pull a kid out of private school just because it became more expensive,"" he said.

THE DEBT The sad fact is, most families with no savings will be borrowing a fair bit of money to send their children to college. The best loans are the federal student loans, and most traditional-age students can take out $31,000 in loans during their time as undergraduates. If you get in trouble later, you can enroll in an income-based repayment plan to lower your payments.

These plans tend not to be available from private lenders who peddle what are known as private student loans. This week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a scathing report, calling the lenders out for making little progress on helping distressed borrowers. You should read every single word of it if you're considering these loans, since parents almost always have to co-sign for them and then suffer the consequences if young adults don't or can't make the payments. The nearly inevitable conclusion of reading the report is that you should do everything possible to avoid taking out loans like this.

That leaves parent borrowing, often in the form of federal Plus loans. It will be tempting to rack these up, come what may, to give a child a shot at attending a dream school. The cost, however, may be payments that last well into what are supposed to be your retirement years. Perhaps your children will help make the payments one day, but you won't be able to refinance the loans into their names. ""I talk to a lot of parents who call and want to refinance, and it's clear that they never read the terms and conditions,"" said Andy Josuweit, founder of Student Loan Hero, which helps people sort and consolidate student loan debt.

The steps above should help you avoid at least some of the confusion. As for the sadness and despair that can result from too much debt or picking the wrong college, that often happens when giddy families, acceptance letters in hand and nothing in the bank, make hasty decisions over just a few weeks in April. It is never easy to determine the prudent amount to spend and borrow, but you'll have a much better chance of making the right decision if you start considering the options now.

75,75,2014-11-05-MidtermElections.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody.  Have a seat.

Today, I had a chance to speak with John Boehner and congratulated Mitch McConnell on becoming the next Senate Majority Leader.  And I told them both that I look forward to finishing up this Congressâ business, and then working together for the next two years to advance Americaâs business.  And I very much appreciated Leader McConnellâs words last night about the prospect of working together to deliver for the American people. On Friday, I look forward to hosting the entire Republican and Democratic leadership at the White House to chart a new course forward.

Obviously, Republicans had a good night, and they deserve credit for running good campaigns.  Beyond that, Iâll leave it to all of you and the professional pundits to pick through yesterdayâs results.  What stands out to me, though, is that the American people sent a message, one that theyâve sent for several elections now.  They expect the people they elect to work as hard as they do.  They expect us to focus on their ambitions and not ours.  They want us to get the job done.

All of us, in both parties, have a responsibility to address that sentiment.  Still, as President, I have a unique responsibility to try and make this town work.  So, to everyone who voted, I want you to know that I hear you.  To the two-thirds of voters who chose not to participate in the process yesterday, I hear you, too.  All of us have to give more Americans a reason to feel like the ground is stable beneath their feet, that the future is secure, that thereâs a path for young people to succeed, and that folks here in Washington are concerned about them.  So I plan on spending every moment of the next two-plus years doing my job the best I can to keep this country safe and to make sure that more Americans share in its prosperity.

This country has made real progress since the crisis six years ago.  The fact is more Americans are working; unemployment has come down.  More Americans have health insurance.  Manufacturing has grown.  Our deficits have shrunk.  Our dependence on foreign oil is down, as are gas prices.  Our graduation rates are up.  Our businesses arenât just creating jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s, our economy is outpacing most of the world.  But weâve just got to keep at it until every American feels the gains of a growing economy where it matters most, and that's in their own lives.

Obviously, much of that will take action from Congress.  And Iâm eager to work with the new Congress to make the next two years as productive as possible.  I'm committed to making sure that I measure ideas not by whether they are from Democrats or Republicans, but whether they work for the American people.  And thatâs not to say that we wonât disagree over some issues that weâre passionate about.  We will.  Congress will pass some bills I cannot sign.  I'm pretty sure I'll take some actions that some in Congress will not like.  Thatâs natural.  That's how our democracy works.  But we can surely find ways to work together on issues where thereâs broad agreement among the American people.

So I look forward to Republicans putting forward their governing agenda.  I will offer my ideas on areas where I think we can move together to respond to peopleâs economic needs.

So, just take one example.  We all agree on the need to create more jobs that pay well.  Traditionally, both parties have been for creating jobs rebuilding our infrastructure -- our roads, bridges, ports, waterways.  I think we can hone in on a way to pay for it through tax reform that closes loopholes and makes it more attractive for companies to create jobs here in the United States.

We can also work together to grow our exports and open new markets for our manufacturers to sell more American-made goods to the rest of the world.  That's something Iâll be focused on when I travel to Asia next week.

We all share the same aspirations for our young people.  And I was encouraged that this year Republicans agreed to investments that expanded early childhood education.  I think we've got a chance to do more on that front.  Weâve got some common ideas to help more young people afford college and graduate without crippling debt so that they have the freedom to fill the good jobs of tomorrow and buy their first homes and start a family.

And in the five states where a minimum wage increase was on the ballot last night, voters went five for five to increase it. That will give about 325,000 Americans a raise in states where Republican candidates prevailed.  So that should give us new reason to get it done for everybody, with a national increase in the minimum wage.

So those are some areas where I think we've got some real opportunities to cooperate.  And I am very eager to hear Republican ideas for what they think we can do together over the next couple of years.  Of course, thereâs still business on the docket that needs attention this year.  And here are three places where I think we can work together over the next several weeks, before this Congress wraps up for the holidays.

First, Iâm submitting a request to Congress for funding to ensure that our doctors, scientists, and troops have the resources that they need to combat the spread of Ebola in Africa and to increase our preparedness for any future cases here at home.

Second, I'm going to begin engaging Congress over a new Authorization to Use Military Force against ISIL.  The world needs to know we are united behind this effort, and the men and women of our military deserve our clear and unified support.

Third, back in September, Congress passed short-term legislation to keep the government open and operating into December.  That gives Congress five weeks to pass a budget for the rest of the fiscal year.  And I hope that theyâll do it in the same bipartisan, drama-free way that they did earlier this year.  When our companies are steadily creating jobs -- which they are -- we donât want to inject any new uncertainty into the world economy and to the American economy.

The point is itâs time for us to take care of business.  There are things this country has to do that canât wait another two years or another four years.  There are plans this country has to put in place for our future.

And the truth is Iâm optimistic about our future.  I have good reason to be.  I meet Americans all across the country who are determined, and big-hearted, and ask what they can do, and never give up, and overcome obstacles.  And they inspire me every single day.  So the fact is I still believe in what I said when I was first elected six years ago last night.  For all the maps plastered across our TV screens today, and for all the cynics who say otherwise, I continue to believe we are simply more than just a collection of red and blue states.  We are the United States.

And whether it's immigration or climate change, or making sure our kids are going to the best possible schools, to making sure that our communities are creating jobs; whether it's stopping the spread of terror and disease, to opening up doors of opportunity to everybody whoâs willing to work hard and take responsibility -- the United States has big things to do.  We can and we will make progress if we do it together.  And I look forward to the work ahead.

So, with that, let me take some questions.  I think that our team has got my list.  And we're going to start with Julie Pace at Associated Press.
","Republicans took control of Congress in Tuesday's midterm elections, a result that transforms the political dynamic in Washington and gives the GOP new power over President Barack Obama's final two years in the White House.

Republicans won Senate seats from West Virginia to Colorado and beyond to assemble a majority of at least 52 seats, expanded their margin in the House -- possibly to levels not seen in decades -- and won governors' races even in the Democratic states of Illinois and Maryland.

The sweep left Democrats without a majority in either chamber for the first time since 2006.

""It's time to go in a new direction,"" said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) who is in line to become Majority Leader, after he defeated his Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, by a decisive margin. ""We can have real change in Washington, and that's just what I intend to deliver.""

A slow economic recovery and a series of jolting events, including an Ebola outbreak and the rise of Islamic State in the Middle East, left many voters anxious and looking for change.

Tuesday's balloting featured 14 competitive gubernatorial races. Republicans rolled up victories in most top-tier governors' races, with Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Rick Snyder of Michigan and Scott Walker of Wisconsin all notching wins. In traditionally liberal Illinois, Republican Bruce Rauner defeated Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn; and in Maryland, Republican Larry Hogan came from behind to beat Democrat Anthony Brown. In Pennsylvania, Democrat Tom Wolf defeated GOP Gov. Tom Corbett.

By the end of the fall campaign, Democrats were struggling in swing states that were touted as building blocks of the party's ascendancy, including Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire. Republicans' ability to compete in those states bodes well for their prospects in the 2016 presidential race and suggests a possible reshaping of the national political map.

Not since 1980 has the GOP beaten more than two incumbent Senators. On Tuesday, they knocked off at least three.

With the government squarely divided between a GOP Congress and a Democratic White House, new opportunities could open for compromise if both parties and the president decide to bend enough to make deals. That remains a big question in a capital stymied by four years of gridlock. Businesses are banking on seeing progress on such issues as an overhaul of the immigration system and corporate tax code.

In his victory speech, Mr. McConnell hit a conciliatory note. ""We do have an obligation to work together on the issues where we can agree,"" he said. ""Just because we have a two-party system doesn't mean we have to be in perpetual conflict.""

Officially conceding defeat, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) issued a statement congratulating Mr. McConnell.

A GOP-led Senate would have sway over approving Mr. Obama's appointments to cabinet posts, including his next attorney general, and vacant judicial appointments

Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats had hoped to win favor among voters with improvements in the U.S. economy.

But across the country, Democrats struggled against hostile political forces, including Mr. Obama's dwindling standing and a map of competitive elections that tilted heavily in Republicans' favor.

In the U.S. House, Republicans moved toward expanding their majority, with the only question being by how many seats. A gain of 12 seats would give the GOP 246 votes, it's largest share in House since 1946.

The GOP's strong position going into Election Day was a reversal of fortune from bruising losses in the 2012 election. And just a year ago, the party fell in polls after conservatives were blamed for a U.S. government shutdown.

Sen. Mark Pryor was the first Democratic casualty on Tuesday, defeated by GOP Rep. Tom Cotton in Arkansas. Republicans picked up their first Democratic open seat of the night when Rep. Shelley Moore Capito won in West Virginia, the first Senate win by her party since 1956. Wins in Iowa and North Carolina tipped the chamber into the Republican column.

One of the biggest surprises of the night was the unexpectedly close Senate race in Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Mark Warner was expected to easily win re-election. A recount there is possible.

Republicans framed the election as a referendum on Mr. Obama, whose second term has been plagued by acrimony at home and tumult abroad.

His low approval ratings weakened Democratic Senate candidates, who had tried to distance themselves from a president whose historic victory in 2008 had helped them win election.

Even before votes were tallied, the White House sought to deflect the view that the congressional elections were a referendum on the presidency. Vice President Joe Biden predicted Senate Democrats would keep control. On Tuesday, Mr. Obama offered what sounded like excuses for looming losses.

""This is possibly the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower,"" Mr. Obama said during a Tuesday afternoon interview with a public radio station in Connecticut.

The 2014 midterm campaigns were defined by voters' long-simmering frustration with the ability of elected officials in Washington to move the country forward. The economy was the top voter concern, with an overwhelming majority describing economic conditions as poor or ""not so good."" Health care was second on the list.

By better than a two-to-one margin, more voters polled said the next generation would have a worse life than today's. Two-thirds said the U.S. had gone off track -- more widespread negativity than in either the 2010 or 2012 elections. On Tuesday, many voters said they cast ballots more in opposition to one candidate than support for the other.

""It's like the worse of two evils,"" said Mike Ball, of Raleigh, N.C., who voted for Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan because her opponent, state House Speaker Thom Tillis, ""put a bad taste in my mouth."" Mr. Ball, a computer analyst, said he wasn't ""super happy with Hagan.""
","Resurgent Republicans took control of the Senate on Tuesday night, expanded their hold on the House, and defended some of the most closely contested governors' races, in a repudiation of President Obama that will reorder the political map in his final years in office.

Propelled by economic dissatisfaction and anger toward the president, Republicans grabbed Democratic Senate seats in North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, West Virginia, Arkansas, Montana and South Dakota to gain their first Senate majority since 2006. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a shrewd Republican tactician, cruised to re-election and stood poised to achieve a goal he has pursued for years -- Senate majority leader.

An election that started as trench warfare, state by state and district by district, crested into a sweeping Republican victory. Contests that were expected to be close were not, and races expected to go Democratic broke narrowly for the Republicans. The uneven character of the economic recovery added to a sense of anxiety, leaving voters in a punishing mood, particularly for Democrats in Southern states and the Mountain West, where political polarization deepened.

The biggest surprises of the night came in North Carolina, where the Republican, Thom Tillis, came from behind to beat Senator Kay Hagan, and in Virginia. There, Senator Mark Warner, a former Democratic governor of the state, was thought to be one of the safest incumbents in his party, and instead found himself clinging to the narrowest of leads against a former Republican Party chairman, Ed Gillespie.

Those contests were measures of how difficult the terrain was for Democrats in an election where Republicans put together their strategy as a referendum on the competence of government, embodied by Mr. Obama.

House seats where Democrats had fought off Republican encroachment for years were finally toppled. Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was easily re-elected in Wisconsin, a state that voted twice for Mr. Obama. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott, once considered endangered, finished the night on top. And states that had seemingly been trending Democratic, like Colorado and Iowa, fell into Republican hands.

With at least a nine-seat gain and most likely more, House Republicans will have close to 245 seats, the largest Republican majority since the Truman administration.

""Barack Obama has our country in a ditch, and many of his lieutenants running for the Senate were right there with him,"" said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. ""The punishment is going to be broad, and it's going to be pretty serious.""

The breadth of the Republican victories also reset the political landscape ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign. And it left Mr. Obama with a decision to make: Will he move toward Republicans in his final years in areas of common interest, such as tax reform and trade, or will he dig in and hope Republican overreach will give his party a lane for a comeback?

""Just because we have a two-party system doesn't mean we have to be in perpetual conflict,"" vowed Mr. McConnell, in a victory speech.

White House officials accepted the overture and said Mr. Obama had invited the bipartisan leadership of Congress to the White House on Friday.

For Republicans, the victories piled up, winning not only Senate Democratic seats they were expected to take -- Montana, West Virginia, South Dakota and Arkansas -- but also in states that were supposed to be close. Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican, crushed Senator Mark Udall in Colorado. In Georgia, the Democrat Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn, was widely expected to force David Perdue, a Republican businessman, into a runoff for the Senate seat of Saxby Chambliss, a retiring Republican. Instead, Mr. Perdue won more than half the vote to take the race outright.

Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, also fended off the independent challenger Greg Orman, who just weeks ago appeared headed to victory.

And for Democrats, it could get worse. Votes were still being tallied in Alaska, where Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, was trying to hold back the wave. Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana was able to force her strongest Republican foe, Representative Bill Cassidy, into a Dec. 6 runoff. But the combined vote of the top two Republicans in the race easily eclipsed hers.

""I think it's a message from the American people about their concern about the direction of the country, and the competency of the current administration,"" said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""Most people have voted to end the dysfunction and to get back to legislating on issues that will help them and their families, and I think that's something that both parties need to listen to.""

One bright spot for Democrats came in New Hampshire, where Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic incumbent, fended off Scott Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, according to projections by The Associated Press. In Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, a Democrat and political novice, easily defeated the Republican governor, Tom Corbett.

And in the panhandle of Florida, Gwen Graham, daughter of a former Democratic senator and governor, defeated Representative Steve Southerland, a Tea Party favorite.

But those high notes were swamped by the lows for the president's party. In Arkansas, Representative Tom Cotton, a freshman Republican and an Iraq War veteran, defeated Senator Mark Pryor, despite the efforts of former President Bill Clinton.

In Colorado, Mr. Udall tried to replicate the storied ground game that helped propel his Democratic colleague, Senator Michael Bennet, to an unexpected victory in 2010. He was not even close, and drew further criticism for running a campaign that some felt was too focused on abortion rights and contraception.

And in West Virginia, Representative Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, won the Senate seat long held by Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat, to become that state's first female senator and the first Republican elected to the Senate from West Virginia since 1956. In Iowa, Joni Ernst also made history by becoming the first woman to be elected in that state's congressional delegation.

Two years after handing Democrats broad victories, voters again seemed to be reaching for a way to end Washington inertia. Yet the results on Tuesday may serve only to reinforce it. Voters appeared unsure of just what they wanted, according to surveys. Among those who voted for a Democrat, only one out of eight expressed an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party. Republican voters were more conflicted; among those who voted Republican, one of four viewed the party unfavorably.

Mr. Obama is left with the prospect of finding a new path to work with Republicans, something for which he has shown little inclination, and Republicans must find a way to demonstrate they are more than the party of ""no.""

Even though a record $4 billion poured into the election -- from the campaigns, parties and outside groups for advertising and other candidate support -- the money did little to stir enthusiasm as the campaign set a more dubious mark for its low levels of voter interest.

For their part, Democrats were hindered by their inability to persuade members of the coalition that delivered the White House to Mr. Obama -- young voters, women and minorities -- to turn out at levels seen in presidential elections. Decisions like Mr. Obama's delay of executive action on behalf of illegal immigrants also angered crucial constituencies.

Even the president conceded the steep climb his allies faced.

""This is possibly the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower,"" Mr. Obama told a Connecticut public radio station on Tuesday. ""There are a lot of states that are being contested where they just tend to tilt Republican.""

Democratic midterm losses during the Obama presidency now rival those of both Richard M. Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1994 as the most destructive to his party's political standing in Congress in the post-World War II era. It was a stunning reversal for the president, who was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win a majority of the national vote.

""The top issue is not jobs and the economy; it's ending gridlock in Washington,"" said Mr. Portman. ""Second, there is a desire to hold the administration accountable for incompetence on issues like ISIS and Ebola. I don't think those goals are inconsistent.""

With the political climate and the electoral map playing to their decided advantage, Republicans were determined not to relive the elections of 2010 and 2012, when infighting between establishment Republicans and Tea Party insurgents damaged the party's brand and elevated candidates who could not win.

From the beginning, party officials decided to take sides when fierce primary challenges emerged. The party establishment crushed challengers to Mr. McConnell in Kentucky, and to Senators Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee.

The establishment also sent reinforcements to help Senator Thad Cochran eke out a runoff victory against a Tea Party firebrand in Mississippi; cleared the Republican field for Mr. Gardner in Colorado; and backed winning primary candidates in Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Alaska.

Democrats tried to distance themselves from the president's health care law and economic policies, despite signs that both may be working. In Colorado, Mr. Udall relied on the playbook that propelled his Colorado colleague and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman, Senator Michael Bennet, to victory in 2010, speaking almost exclusively about abortion rights and contraception. That cost him the endorsement of The Denver Post, which castigated him for an ""obnoxious, one-issue campaign.""

Lost was Mr. Udall's work in the Senate opposing Mr. Obama's policies on security surveillance and privacy.

In Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes, considered a strong challenger to Mr. McConnell, lost some support when she refused to say whether she voted for Mr. Obama, and ran a risk-averse campaign.

But mainly, Democrats were working off a map heavily tilted toward Republicans in states like West Virginia, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas and Alaska, in a year when disengaged, frustrated voters and Mr. Obama's low approval ratings were inevitably going to be a millstone.

76,76,2014-12-18-CubaRelations.txt,"Good afternoon.  Today, the United States of America is changing its relationship with the people of Cuba.
 
In the most significant changes in our policy in more than fifty years, we will end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries.  Through these changes, we intend to create more opportunities for the American and Cuban people, and begin a new chapter among the nations of the Americas.
 
Thereâs a complicated history between the United States and Cuba.  I was born in 1961 -- just over two years after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, and just a few months after the Bay of Pigs invasion, which tried to overthrow his regime. Over the next several decades, the relationship between our countries played out against the backdrop of the Cold War, and Americaâs steadfast opposition to communism.  We are separated by just over 90 miles. But year after year, an ideological and economic barrier hardened between our two countries.
 
Meanwhile, the Cuban exile community in the United States made enormous contributions to our country -- in politics and business, culture and sports.  Like immigrants before, Cubans helped remake America, even as they felt a painful yearning for the land and families they left behind.  All of this bound America and Cuba in a unique relationship, at once family and foe.
 
Proudly, the United States has supported democracy and human rights in Cuba through these five decades. We have done so primarily through policies that aimed to isolate the island, preventing the most basic travel and commerce that Americans can enjoy anyplace else.  And though this policy has been rooted in the best of intentions, no other nation joins us in imposing these sanctions, and it has had little effect beyond providing the Cuban government with a rationale for restrictions on its people.  Today, Cuba is still governed by the Castros and the Communist Party that came to power half a century ago.
 
Neither the American, nor Cuban people are well served by a rigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born.  Consider that for more than 35 years, weâve had relations with China -- a far larger country also governed by a Communist Party.  Nearly two decades ago, we reestablished relations with Vietnam, where we fought a war that claimed more Americans than any Cold War confrontation.
 
Thatâs why -- when I came into office -- I promised to re-examine our Cuba policy.  As a start, we lifted restrictions for Cuban Americans to travel and send remittances to their families in Cuba.  These changes, once controversial, now seem obvious. Cuban Americans have been reunited with their families, and are the best possible ambassadors for our values.  And through these exchanges, a younger generation of Cuban Americans has increasingly questioned an approach that does more to keep Cuba closed off from an interconnected world.
 
While I have been prepared to take additional steps for some time, a major obstacle stood in our way -- the wrongful imprisonment, in Cuba, of a U.S. citizen and USAID sub-contractor Alan Gross for five years.  Over many months, my administration has held discussions with the Cuban government about Alanâs case, and other aspects of our relationship.  His Holiness Pope Francis issued a personal appeal to me, and to Cubaâs President Raul Castro, urging us to resolve Alanâs case, and to address Cubaâs interest in the release of three Cuban agents who have been jailed in the United States for over 15 years.


 
Today, Alan returned home -- reunited with his family at long last.  Alan was released by the Cuban government on humanitarian grounds.  Separately, in exchange for the three Cuban agents, Cuba today released one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba, and who has been imprisoned for nearly two decades.  This man, whose sacrifice has been known to only a few, provided America with the information that allowed us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today, as well as other spies in the United States.  This man is now safely on our shores. 
 
Having recovered these two men who sacrificed for our country, Iâm now taking steps to place the interests of the people of both countries at the heart of our policy.
 
First, Iâve instructed Secretary Kerry to immediately begin discussions with Cuba to reestablish diplomatic relations that have been severed since January of 1961.  Going forward, the United States will reestablish an embassy in Havana, and high-ranking officials will visit Cuba.
 
Where we can advance shared interests, we will -- on issues like health, migration, counterterrorism, drug trafficking and disaster response.  Indeed, weâve seen the benefits of cooperation between our countries before.  It was a Cuban, Carlos Finlay, who discovered that mosquitoes carry yellow fever; his work helped Walter Reed fight it.  Cuba has sent hundreds of health care workers to Africa to fight Ebola, and I believe American and Cuban health care workers should work side by side to stop the spread of this deadly disease.
 
Now, where we disagree, we will raise those differences directly -- as we will continue to do on issues related to democracy and human rights in Cuba.  But I believe that we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement.  After all, these 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked.  Itâs time for a new approach.
 
Second, Iâve instructed Secretary Kerry to review Cubaâs designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.  This review will be guided by the facts and the law.  Terrorism has changed in the last several decades.  At a time when we are focused on threats from al Qaeda to ISIL, a nation that meets our conditions and renounces the use of terrorism should not face this sanction.
 
Third, we are taking steps to increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to and from Cuba.  This is fundamentally about freedom and openness, and also expresses my belief in the power of people-to-people engagement.  With the changes Iâm announcing today, it will be easier for Americans to travel to Cuba, and Americans will be able to use American credit and debit cards on the island.  Nobody represents Americaâs values better than the American people, and I believe this contact will ultimately do more to empower the Cuban people.
 
I also believe that more resources should be able to reach the Cuban people.  So weâre significantly increasing the amount of money that can be sent to Cuba, and removing limits on remittances that support humanitarian projects, the Cuban people, and the emerging Cuban private sector.
 
I believe that American businesses should not be put at a disadvantage, and that increased commerce is good for Americans and for Cubans.  So we will facilitate authorized transactions between the United States and Cuba.  U.S. financial institutions will be allowed to open accounts at Cuban financial institutions.  And it will be easier for U.S. exporters to sell goods in Cuba.
 
I believe in the free flow of information.  Unfortunately, our sanctions on Cuba have denied Cubans access to technology that has empowered individuals around the globe.  So Iâve authorized increased telecommunications connections between the United States and Cuba.  Businesses will be able to sell goods that enable Cubans to communicate with the United States and other countries. 
 
These are the steps that I can take as President to change this policy.  The embargo thatâs been imposed for decades is now codified in legislation.  As these changes unfold, I look forward to engaging Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo. 
 
Yesterday, I spoke with Raul Castro to finalize Alan Grossâs release and the exchange of prisoners, and to describe how we will move forward.  I made clear my strong belief that Cuban society is constrained by restrictions on its citizens.  In addition to the return of Alan Gross and the release of our intelligence agent, we welcome Cubaâs decision to release a substantial number of prisoners whose cases were directly raised with the Cuban government by my team.  We welcome Cubaâs decision to provide more access to the Internet for its citizens, and to continue increasing engagement with international institutions like the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross that promote universal values.
 
But Iâm under no illusion about the continued barriers to freedom that remain for ordinary Cubans.  The United States believes that no Cubans should face harassment or arrest or beatings simply because theyâre exercising a universal right to have their voices heard, and we will continue to support civil society there.  While Cuba has made reforms to gradually open up its economy, we continue to believe that Cuban workers should be free to form unions, just as their citizens should be free to participate in the political process.
 
Moreover, given Cubaâs history, I expect it will continue to pursue foreign policies that will at times be sharply at odds with American interests.  I do not expect the changes I am announcing today to bring about a transformation of Cuban society overnight.  But I am convinced that through a policy of engagement, we can more effectively stand up for our values and help the Cuban people help themselves as they move into the 21st century.
 
To those who oppose the steps Iâm announcing today, let me say that I respect your passion and share your commitment to liberty and democracy.  The question is how we uphold that commitment.  I do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result.  Moreover, it does not serve Americaâs interests, or the Cuban people, to try to push Cuba toward collapse.  Even if that worked -- and it hasnât for 50 years -- we know from hard-earned experience that countries are more likely to enjoy lasting transformation if their people are not subjected to chaos.  We are calling on Cuba to unleash the potential of 11 million Cubans by ending unnecessary restrictions on their political, social, and economic activities.  In that spirit, we should not allow U.S. sanctions to add to the burden of Cuban citizens that we seek to help.
 
To the Cuban people, America extends a hand of friendship.  Some of you have looked to us as a source of hope, and we will continue to shine a light of freedom.  Others have seen us as a former colonizer intent on controlling your future.  JosÃ© MartÃ­ once said, âLiberty is the right of every man to be honest.â  Today, I am being honest with you.  We can never erase the history between us, but we believe that you should be empowered to live with dignity and self-determination.  Cubans have a saying about daily life:  âNo es facilâ -- itâs not easy.  Today, the United States wants to be a partner in making the lives of ordinary Cubans a little bit easier, more free, more prosperous.
 
To those who have supported these measures, I thank you for being partners in our efforts.  In particular, I want to thank His Holiness Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is; the government of Canada, which hosted our discussions with the Cuban government; and a bipartisan group of congressmen who have worked tirelessly for Alan Grossâs release, and for a new approach to advancing our interests and values in Cuba.
 
Finally, our shift in policy towards Cuba comes at a moment of renewed leadership in the Americas.  This April, we are prepared to have Cuba join the other nations of the hemisphere at the Summit of the Americas.  But we will insist that civil society join us so that citizens, not just leaders, are shaping our future.  And I call on all of my fellow leaders to give meaning to the commitment to democracy and human rights at the heart of the Inter-American Charter.  Let us leave behind the legacy of both colonization and communism, the tyranny of drug cartels, dictators and sham elections.  A future of greater peace, security and democratic development is possible if we work together -- not to maintain power, not to secure vested interest, but instead to advance the dreams of our citizens.
 
My fellow Americans, the city of Miami is only 200 miles or so from Havana.  Countless thousands of Cubans have come to Miami -- on planes and makeshift rafts; some with little but the shirt on their back and hope in their hearts.  Today, Miami is often referred to as the capital of Latin America.  But it is also a profoundly American city -- a place that reminds us that ideals matter more than the color of our skin, or the circumstances of our birth; a demonstration of what the Cuban people can achieve, and the openness of the United States to our family to the South.  Todos somos Americanos.
 
Change is hard -- in our own lives, and in the lives of nations.  And change is even harder when we carry the heavy weight of history on our shoulders.  But today we are making these changes because it is the right thing to do.  Today, America chooses to cut loose the shackles of the past so as to reach for a better future -- for the Cuban people, for the American people, for our entire hemisphere, and for the world.
 
Thank you.  God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
","The U.S. and Cuba agreed to restore diplomatic ties after a half century of hostility, ending one of the world's last Cold War standoffs and launching a realignment of the politics of the Americas.

President Barack Obama and Raul Castro, in synchronized announcements Wednesday, said that their long-estranged countries would restart cooperation on a range of issues and reestablish an American embassy in Havana that closed in 1961 after the Cuban Revolution.

The leaders agreed to a series of landmark diplomatic steps after reaching a deal to free U.S. aid worker Alan Gross, who was imprisoned in Cuba for the past five years. The White House also agreed to return three Cuban agents jailed in the U.S. in exchange for Cuba's release of one unnamed American intelligence operative who had been held for nearly two decades.

The policy changes fall short of fully lifting the 54-year U.S. embargo against Cuba, which would require an act from Congress. But they forge significant economic ties between the two nations by allowing American financial institutions to open accounts with Cuban counterparts, easing restrictions on the export of U.S. agricultural and telecommunications gear to Cuba and permitting Americans to use credit and debit cards there. U.S. residents will be allowed to send up to $2,000 every three months to relatives on the island -- four times the current limit.

The new regulations will make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba under the 12 categories of travel now allowed, which currently range from family visits to humanitarian projects and educational and sports activities -- and bring home more than $400 worth of goods, including a limited amount of Cuban cigars.

The Obama administration has also begun the process of removing the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism.

The softening of U.S. relations with Cuba, a nation of 11 million just 90 miles off the coast of Florida, is the latest in a series of attempts by Mr. Obama to recalibrate American foreign policy as his time in office winds down. It secures a major legacy item for the president while setting up another pitched battle with lawmakers, including Republicans who next year will control both the House and Senate.

U.S. officials said they expected the two countries to continue to have strong differences, particularly on issues of democracy and human rights. But Washington and Havana can cooperate on issues such as migration, counterterrorism and battling Ebola, the officials said.

""Our emphasis on human rights will be just as strong and we believe more effective under this policy,"" a senior administration official said.

Mr. Obama said the policy changes mark the beginning of ""a new chapter"" for the Americas, and he urged Congress to bolster his executive actions by lifting the Cuba embargo.

""In the most significant changes in our policy in more than 50 years, we will end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries,"" Mr. Obama said from the White House.

""As these changes unfold, I look forward to engaging Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo,"" Mr. Obama said.

""Neither the American, nor Cuban people are well served by a rigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born,"" he added.

Mr. Castro, in his televised statement, said Cuba was open to dialogue with the U.S. on democracy and human rights, which U.S. officials said are still top concerns, but said Havana was seeking a total end to the U.S. economic embargo.

""This doesn't mean that the main issues have been resolved,"" Mr. Castro said.

The decision by Mr. Obama sets up another policy fight with lawmakers.

Critics such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), a Cuban-American who is expected to head a key subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pledged Congress wouldn't lift the embargo with Cuba.

Congress's power of the purse may be opponents' best chance to block President Obama's efforts. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), who is expected to head an appropriations subcommittee with oversight of foreign operations, tweeted Wednesday he would ""do all in my power to block the use of funds to open an embassy in Cuba. Normalizing relations with Cuba is a bad idea at a bad time.""

In the first phone call between the leaders of the U.S. and Cuba since the revolution, Messrs. Obama and Castro discussed the planned policy changes on Tuesday.

That was the culmination of some 18 months of secret negotiations between senior U.S. and Cuban officials that were aided by the Canadian government and Pope Francis at the Vatican.

Many Cuban dissidents also welcomed the moves. Miriam Celaya, an independent journalist and dissident, said the moves will make it easier for dissidents to press for rights, since the government can no longer claim they are tools of a hostile government.

""I think it's the Cuban government which has been cornered,"" she said in a telephone interview.

Since taking over the reins of power from his elder brother, Mr. Castro has been stymied in the pace of reforms by Fidel, who most analysts say is still an influential conservative force. But the elder Castro is in fragile health, and Cuba is in precarious economic straits.

Raul Castro has said he will step down in 2018, possibly clearing the way for Miguel Diaz-Canel, the first vice president, who appears to be his favored successor.

Mr. Obama said Secretary of State John Kerry would lead the effort to re-establish relations. Mr. Kerry said he looked forward to becoming ""the first secretary of state in 60 years to visit Cuba."" He also said he was sending an envoy to Havana next month to pick up the talks of formally re-establishing diplomatic relations.

Mr. Obama wouldn't turn down an invitation to visit Cuba, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.

The president's detente with Cuba, something he has pledged to pursue ever since his 2008 presidential campaign, could shake up the international order.

U.S. policy toward Cuba has been an increasing point of contention with other countries in the hemisphere. In Latin America, the administration said rapprochement with Cuba puts the U.S. in alignment with its closest regional allies, who have lobbied for years for a lifting of the economic embargo on Havana.

These officials also said it would counter the ability of regional leaders to cite U.S. foreign policy as the rationale for pursuing repressive policies and keeping their economies closed.

""This takes the United States out of the equation,"" said Peter Schechter, a director at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, and a Latin America expert.

Mr. Obama said he was ""convinced that through a policy of engagement, we can more effectively stand up for our values and help the Cuban people help themselves as they move into the 21st century.""

U.S. officials and Latin American experts said normalization with Cuba could significantly impact other regional countries traditionally hostile to the U.S., such as Venezuela.

Caracas is facing an economic crisis due to the recent plunge of oil prices. Analysts say the possibility of losing Venezuelan aid likely played a role in Cuba reaching agreement with the U.S. As a result of the deal, Venezuela could lose a major partner in its efforts to galvanize regional opposition to U.S. policies.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to be particularly wary of Washington's rapprochement with Havana.

Cuba has long been the Kremlin's closest ally in the Northern Hemisphere, and Mr. Putin isn't seen as willing to easily lose his preferential ties to the Caribbean country.

U.S. officials also hope renewed relations with Cuba will aid the White House's efforts to forge an agreement with Iran limiting its nuclear program by convincing Tehran that the U.S. is serious about a deal.

Despite some lawmakers' outcry, senior administration officials said they hoped the new policy would help build support for legislative action to further erode the embargo. ""We believe that the utility of these policy changes will become evident and will hopefully create greater momentum for legislative action going forward,"" an administration official said.

One unresolved issue is the deal's implication for American Major League Baseball. Cuba is a powerhouse in the league, which despite the embargo and Cuba's travel restrictions has welcomed more than 20 new Cuban players since 2010.
","President Obama on Wednesday ordered the restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba and the opening of an embassy in Havana for the first time in more than a half-century as he vowed to ""cut loose the shackles of the past"" and sweep aside one of the last vestiges of the Cold War.

The surprise announcement came at the end of 18 months of secret talks that produced a prisoner swap negotiated with the help of Pope Francis and concluded by a telephone call between Mr. Obama and President RaÃºl Castro. The historic deal broke an enduring stalemate between two countries divided by just 90 miles of water but oceans of mistrust and hostility dating from the days of Theodore Roosevelt's charge up San Juan Hill and the nuclear brinkmanship of the Cuban missile crisis.

""We will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries,"" Mr. Obama said in a nationally televised statement from the White House. The deal, he added, will ""begin a new chapter among the nations of the Americas"" and move beyond a ""rigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born.""

In doing so, Mr. Obama ventured into diplomatic territory where the last 10 presidents refused to go, and Republicans, along with a senior Democrat, quickly characterized the rapprochement with the Castro family as appeasement of the hemisphere's leading dictatorship. Republican lawmakers who will take control of the Senate as well as the House next month made clear they would resist lifting the 54-year-old trade embargo.

""This entire policy shift announced today is based on an illusion, on a lie, the lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people,"" said Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida and son of Cuban immigrants. ""All this is going to do is give the Castro regime, which controls every aspect of Cuban life, the opportunity to manipulate these changes to perpetuate itself in power.""

For good or ill, the move represented a dramatic turning point in relations with an island that for generations has captivated and vexed its giant northern neighbor. From the 18th century, when successive presidents coveted it, Cuba loomed large in the American imagination long before Fidel Castro stormed from the mountains and seized power in 1959.

Mr. Castro's alliance with the Soviet Union made Cuba a geopolitical flash point in a global struggle of ideology and power. President Dwight D. Eisenhower imposed the first trade embargo in 1960 and broke off diplomatic relations in January 1961, just weeks before leaving office and seven months before Mr. Obama was born. Under President John F. Kennedy, the failed Bay of Pigs operation aimed at toppling Mr. Castro in April 1961 and the 13-day showdown over Soviet missiles installed in Cuba the following year cemented its status as a ground zero in the Cold War.

But the relationship remained frozen in time long after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a thorn in the side of multiple presidents who waited for Mr. Castro's demise and experienced false hope when he passed power to his brother, RaÃºl. Even as the United States built relations with Communist nations like China and Vietnam, Cuba remained one of just a few nations, along with Iran and North Korea, that had no formal ties with Washington.

Mr. Obama has long expressed hope of transforming relations with Cuba and relaxed some travel restrictions in 2011. But further moves remained untenable as long as Cuba held Alan P. Gross, an American government contractor arrested in 2009 and sentenced to 15 years in a Cuban prison for trying to deliver satellite telephone equipment capable of cloaking connections to the Internet.

After winning re-election, Mr. Obama resolved to make Cuba a priority for his second term and authorized secret negotiations led by two aides, Benjamin J. Rhodes and Ricardo ZÃºÃ±iga, who conducted nine meetings with Cuban counterparts starting in June 2013, most of them in Canada, which has ties with Havana.

Pope Francis encouraged the talks with letters to Mr. Obama and Mr. Castro and had the Vatican host a meeting in October to finalize the terms of the deal. Mr. Obama spoke with Mr. Castro by telephone on Tuesday to seal the agreement in a call that lasted more than 45 minutes, the first direct substantive contact between the leaders of the two countries in more than 50 years.

On Wednesday morning, Mr. Gross walked out of a Cuban prison and boarded an American military plane that flew him to Washington, accompanied by his wife, Judy. While eating a corned beef sandwich on rye bread with mustard during the flight, Mr. Gross received a call from Mr. Obama. ""He's back where he belongs, in America with his family, home for Hanukkah,"" Mr. Obama said later.

For its part, the United States sent back three imprisoned Cuban spies who were caught in 1998 and had become a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre for the Havana government. They were swapped for Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a Cuban who had worked as an agent for American intelligence and had been in a Cuban prison for nearly 20 years, according to a senior American official. Mr. Gross was not technically part of the swap, officials said, but was released separately on ""humanitarian grounds,"" a distinction critics found unpersuasive.

The United States will ease restrictions on remittances, travel and banking, while Cuba will allow more Internet access and release 53 Cubans identified as political prisoners by the United States. Although the embargo will remain in place, the president called for an ""honest and serious debate about lifting"" it, which would require an act of Congress.

Mr. Castro spoke simultaneously on Cuban television, taking to the airwaves with no introduction and announcing that he had spoken by telephone with Mr. Obama on Tuesday.

""We have been able to make headway in the solution of some topics of mutual interest for both nations,"" he declared, emphasizing the release of the three Cubans. ""President Obama's decision deserves the respect and acknowledgment of our people.""

Only afterward did Mr. Castro mention the reopening of diplomatic relations. ""This in no way means that the heart of the matter has been resolved,"" he said. ""The economic, commercial and financial blockade, which causes enormous human and economic damages to our country, must cease."" But, he added, ""the progress made in our exchanges proves that it is possible to find solutions to many problems.""

Mr. Obama is gambling that restoring ties with Cuba may no longer be politically unthinkable with the generational shift among Cuban-Americans, where many younger children of exiles are open to change. Nearly six in 10 Americans support re-establishing relations with Cuba, according to a New York Times poll conducted in October. Mr. Obama's move had the support of the Catholic Church, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Human Rights Watch and major agricultural interests.

At a news conference in Washington, Mr. Gross said he supported Mr. Obama's move toward normalizing relations with Cuba, adding that his own ordeal and the injustice with which Cuban people had been treated were ""a consequence of two governments' mutually belligerent policies.""

""Five and a half decades of history show us that such belligerence inhibits better judgment,"" he said. ""Two wrongs never make a right. This is a game-changer, which I fully support.""

But leading Republicans, including Speaker John A. Boehner and the incoming Senate majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, did not. In addition to Mr. Rubio, two other Republican potential candidates for president joined in the criticism. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called it a ""very, very bad deal,"" while former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said it ""undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba.""

A leading Democrat agreed. ""It is a fallacy that Cuba will reform just because the American president believes that if he extends his hand in peace, that the Castro brothers suddenly will unclench their fists,"" said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the outgoing chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a Cuban-American.

While the United States has no embassy in Havana, there is a bare-bones facility called an interests section that can be upgraded, currently led by a diplomat, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who will become the chargÃ© d'affaires pending the nomination and confirmation of an ambassador.

Mr. Obama has instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to begin the process of removing Cuba from the list of states that sponsor terrorism, and the president announced that he would attend a regional Summit of the Americas next spring that Mr. Castro is also to attend. Mr. Obama will send an assistant secretary of state to Havana next month to talk about migration, and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker may lead a commercial mission.

Mr. Obama's decision will ease travel restrictions for family visits, public performances, and professional, educational and religious activities, among other things, but ordinary tourism will still be banned under the law. Mr. Obama will also allow greater banking ties, making it possible to use credit and debit cards in Cuba, and American travelers will be allowed to import up to $400 worth of goods from Cuba, including up to $100 in tobacco and alcohol products.

""These 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked,"" Mr. Obama said. ""It's time for a new approach.""

He added that he shared the commitment to freedom for Cuba. ""The question is how we uphold that commitment,"" he said. ""I do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result.""

77,77,2015-01-08-CharlieHebdo.txt,"I strongly condemn the horrific shooting at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris that has reportedly killed 12 people. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this terrorist attack and the people of France at this difficult time. France is America's oldest ally and has stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the fight against terrorists who threaten our shared security and the world. Time and again, the French people have stood up for the universal values that generations of our people have defended. France and the great city of Paris where this outrageous attack took place offer the world a timeless example that will endure well beyond the hateful vision of these killers. We are in touch with French officials, and I have directed my administration to provide any assistance needed to help bring these terrorists to justice.
","Masked gunmen stormed the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday, killing a dozen people and decimating a newsroom that long took pride in defying the outrage -- and death threats -- stirred by its caricatures lampooning Islam.

The brutal rampage shocked a nation that has been living in dread of reprisal attacks since joining the fight against Islamist insurgents in Africa and the Middle East. The attack -- by gunmen armed with AK-47 rifles -- triggered an outpouring of public anger at home and expressions of solidarity from around the world.

French authorities late Wednesday identified three suspects, all Frenchmen: Said Kouachi, 34 years old; his brother Cherif Kouachi, 32; and 18-year-old Hamid Mourad.

Police deployed a vast dragnet with hundreds of officers to conduct a manhunt, searching an apartment in the eastern French city of Reims.

Early on Thursday, officials said Mr. Mourad had turned himself into police at the eastern town of Charleville-Mezieres and was in custody. Police also released photos of the brothers and issued an appeal for information on them.

It is unclear whether the gunmen acted alone or were part of a broader organization. But they appeared to have planned the attack and to have been motivated by radical Islamist beliefs.

French television showed footage of two men wearing balaclavas leaving Charlie Hebdo's offices shouting in French: ""We have avenged Prophet Muhammad. We have killed Charlie Hebdo.""

The gunmen also shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" or ""God is great,"" according to a witness cited by Paris prosecutor Francois Molins.

The carnage began around 11 a.m. local time. At least two gunmen dressed in black and wearing ski masks first inadvertently stepped into the wrong building before they stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo in eastern Paris near Place de la Bastille.

After gunning down a receptionist, the men climbed to the second floor, where reporters and cartoonists were in the midst of their weekly editorial meeting, Mr. Molins, the Paris prosecutor, told reporters.

In a burst of gunfire, they killed eight staffers, one guest and a police officer serving as bodyguard to Stephane Charbonnier, the magazine's editor in chief, who had been threatened before, the prosecutor said.

Employees of a TV production company that has offices on the same floor called police upon hearing the shots.

The two men, possibly accompanied by a third person, got into a black car parked in front of the building and drove off, Mr. Molins said. In the next street, they ran into several police patrols, and exchanged gunfire.

One policeman was wounded and lay on the sidewalk. Two of the gunmen got out of the car and calmly moved toward the officer, according to video footage captured by neighbors and shown on French television.

""You wanted to kill us,"" one of the gunmen shouts. ""No, we're good, boss,"" the policeman says, showing his empty hands.

One of the gunmen comes near and shoots him at close range. The assailant flees with his accomplice; the officer, who authorities later identified as Ahmed Merabet, dies.

The group headed north but crashed into another car. A few blocks away they hit a sidewalk post and abandoned their damaged vehicle, then seized another one before vanishing northeast of the city.

At Charlie Hebdo, the newsroom had turned into a horror scene: ""There was blood all over the stairway,"" said Luc Hermann, whose TV production firm shares part of the second floor with the magazine.

When it was over, some of France's most prominent cartoonists were dead, including Jean Cabut, a graphic artist known by his pen name Cabu, Mr. Charbonnier, known as Charb, and Georges Wolinski, the police said.

""It is too much, it's unbearable, abominable, inhuman,"" cartoonist Maurice Sinet, who worked for more than 20 years at Charlie Hebdo, said by email. ""I have no words to describe how devastated and sad I am.""

President Francois Hollande rushed to the scene, calling the shooting a terror attack and ""an act of exceptional barbarity,"" while ordering tightened security around Paris.

Charlie Hebdo has often put France's secular dogma to the test, poking fun at everything that represented power and authority, including organized religion. But many Muslims viewed its cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, published on several occasions, as provocative or even blasphemous.

In 2011, its offices were struck by arson, hours before a special issue of the weekly -- dubbed ""Shariah Hebdo"" -- was published. After that, the weekly moved to a new location that was guarded by police.

The attack adds to already high terrorism concerns in Europe at a time when France and the U.K. are fighting alongside the U.S. against Islamic State insurgents in Iraq and Syria. France has also deployed forces in the Sahara in a bid to crush radical groups there.

The shootings could reverberate more broadly across Europe, where anti-immigration politicians -- including Marine Le Pen in France -- are gaining popularity among voters hit by mass unemployment and a sense of social unraveling.

The assault ranks as one of the deadliest attacks in Paris in decades, surpassing the death toll from a 1995 bombing at the Saint-Michel subway station that killed eight.

The attack came on a busy shopping day in Paris with the start of winter sales that typically attract large numbers of tourists.

Mr. Hollande said several terrorist attacks have been prevented in recent weeks. ""We knew we were under threat, like other countries in the world,"" he said. ""We are under threat because we are a country of freedom, and because we are a country of freedom we ward off threats and will punish aggressors.""

Last month, three violent incidents in three days across France left one person dead, dozens injured and French leaders calling on people to remain calm.

One is being investigated by antiterrorism prosecutors, and authorities said the other two cases appeared to involve mentally unstable individuals.

President Barack Obama was among world leaders to denounce what he called the ""cowardly, evil attacks.""

""The fact that this was an attack on journalists, an attack on our free press, also underscores the degree to which these terrorists fear freedom of speech,"" Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House.

Paris was far from under lockdown, however. Thousands of people poured into the Place de la Republique, close to the magazine's office, for an impromptu rally with handwritten signs such as ""I am Charlie"" or ""We are all Charlie.""
","The police organized an enormous manhunt across the Paris region on Wednesday for three suspects they said were involved in a brazen and methodical midday slaughter at a satirical newspaper that had lampooned Islam.

The terrorist attack by masked gunmen on the newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, left 12 people dead -- including the top editor, prominent cartoonists and police officers -- and was among the deadliest in postwar France. The killers escaped, traumatizing the city and sending shock waves through Europe and beyond.

Officials said late Wednesday that two of the suspects were brothers. They were identified as Said and ChÃ©rif Kouachi, 34 and 32. The third suspect is Hamyd Mourad, 18. News reports said the brothers, known to intelligence services, had been born in Paris, raising the prospect that homegrown Muslim extremists were responsible.

Early Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor said that Mr. Mourad had walked into a police station in Charleville-MÃ©ziÃ¨res, about 145 miles northeast of Paris, and surrendered.

""He introduced himself and was put in custody,"" said the spokeswoman, AgnÃ¨s Thibault-Lecuivre.

The assault threatened to deepen the distrust of France's large Muslim population, coming at a time when Islamic radicalism has become a central concern of security officials throughout Europe. In the space of a few minutes, the assault also crystallized the culture clash between religious extremism and the West's devotion to free expression. Spontaneous rallies expressing support for Charlie Hebdo sprung up later in the day in Paris, throughout Europe and in Union Square in New York.

Officials and witnesses said at least two gunmen had carried out the attack with assault weapons and military-style precision. President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France called it a display of extraordinary ""barbarism"" that was ""without a doubt"" an act of terrorism. He declared Thursday a national day of mourning.

He also raised the terror alert for the Ãle-de-France region, which includes Paris, to its highest level, saying several terrorist attacks had been thwarted in recent weeks as security officials here and elsewhere in Europe have grown increasingly wary of the return of young citizens from fighting in Syria and Iraq.

The French authorities put some schools on lockdown for the day; added security at houses of worship, news media offices and transportation centers; and conducted random searches on the Paris MÃ©tro.

The Paris prosecutor, FranÃ§ois Molins, said that according to witnesses, the attackers had screamed ""Allahu akbar!"" or ""God is great!"" during the attack, which the police characterized as a ""slaughter.""

Corinne Rey, a cartoonist known as Coco, who was at the newspaper office during the attack, told Le Monde that the attackers had spoken fluent French and said that they were part of Al Qaeda.

An amateur video of the assailants' subsequent gunfight with the police showed the men shouting: ""We have avenged the Prophet Muhammad. We have killed Charlie Hebdo!"" The video, the source of which could not be verified, also showed the gunmen killing a police officer as he lay wounded on a nearby street.

The victims at Charlie Hebdo included some of the country's most popular and iconoclastic cartoonists. One, the weekly's editorial director, StÃ©phane Charbonnier, had already been receiving light police protection after earlier threats, the police and Mr. Molins said. An officer assigned to guard Mr. Charbonnier and the newspaper's offices was among the victims.

As news of the assault spread, there was an outpouring of grief mixed with expressions of dismay and demonstrations of solidarity for free speech.

By the evening, not far from the site of the attack in east Paris, an estimated 35,000, young and old, gathered at Place de La RÃ©publique. Some chanted, ""Charlie! Charlie!"" or held signs reading, ""I am Charlie"" -- the message posted on the newspaper's website.

Vigils of hundreds and thousands formed in other cities around France and elsewhere.

Mr. Molins said that two men armed with AK-47 rifles and wearing black masks had forced their way into the weekly's offices, at 10 Rue Nicolas-Appert in the 11th Arrondissement, at about 11:30 a.m. They opened fire at people in the lobby before making their way to the newsroom on the second floor, interrupting a staff meeting and firing at the assembled journalists.

The attackers then fled outside, where they clashed three times with the police. They then drove off in a black CitroÃ«n and headed north on the right bank of Paris. During their escape, prosecutors said, they crashed into another car and injured its female driver before robbing another motorist and driving off in that person's vehicle. The police said that the black CitroÃ«n was found abandoned in the 19th Arrondissement.

The precision with which the assailants handled their weapons suggested that they had received military training, the police said. During the attack, which the police said lasted a matter of minutes, several journalists hid under their desks or on the roof, witnesses said.

One journalist, who was at a weekly office meeting during the attack and asked that her name not be used, texted a friend after the shooting: ""I'm alive. There is death all around me. Yes, I am there. The jihadists spared me.""

Treasured by many, hated by some and indiscriminate in its offensiveness, Charlie Hebdo has long reveled in provoking.

In 2011, the office of the weekly was badly damaged by a firebomb after it published a spoof issue ""guest edited"" by the Prophet Muhammad to salute the victory of an Islamist party in Tunisian elections. It had announced plans to publish a special issue renamed ""Charia Hebdo,"" a play on the word in French for Shariah law.

Police said the dead included four celebrated cartoonists at the weekly, including Mr. Charbonnier, known as Charb, Jean Cabut, Georges Wolinski and Bernard Verlhac.

Mr. Charbonnier stoked controversy and drew the ire of many in the Muslim community in 2006 when he republished satirical cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that had been published in a Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten. His last cartoon for Charlie Hebdo featured an armed man who appeared to be a Muslim fighter with a headline that read: ""Still no attacks in France. Wait! We have until the end of January to offer our wishes.""

Michael J. Morell, a former deputy director of the C.I.A. and now a consultant to CBS News, said it was unclear whether the attackers had acted on their own or been directed by organized groups. He called the motive of the attackers ""absolutely clear: trying to shut down a media organization that lampooned the Prophet Muhammad.""

""So, no doubt in my mind that this is terrorism,"" he said.

Mr. Morell added, ""What we have to figure out here is the perpetrators and whether they were self-radicalized or whether they were individuals who fought in Syria and Iraq and came back, or whether they were actually directed by ISIS or Al Qaeda.""

Dalil Boubakeur, the rector of the Grand Mosque in Paris, one of France's largest, expressed horror at the assault. ""We are shocked and surprised that something like this could happen in the center of Paris. But where are we?"" he was quoted as saying by Europe1, a radio broadcaster.

""We strongly condemn these kinds of acts, and we expect the authorities to take the most appropriate measures,"" he said, adding, ""This is a deafening declaration of war.""

The attack comes as thousands of Europeans have joined jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria, further fueling concerns about Islamic radicalism and terrorism being imported. Those worries have been especially acute in France, where fears have grown that militants are bent on retaliation for the government's support for the United States-led air campaign against jihadists with the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.

Last month, Prime Minister Manuel Valls ordered hundreds of additional military personnel onto the streets after a series of attacks across France raised alarms over Islamic terror.

In Dijon and Nantes, a total of 23 people were injured when men drove vehicles into crowds, with one of the drivers shouting an Islamic rallying cry. The authorities depicted both drivers as mentally unstable. The attacks came after violence attributed to ""lone-wolf"" attackers in London in 2013, in Canada in October and last month in Sydney, Australia.

In September, fighters in Algeria aligned with the Islamic State beheaded HervÃ© Gourdel, a 55-year-old mountaineering guide from Nice, and released a video documenting the murder. Mr. Gourdel had been kidnapped after the Islamic State called on its supporters to wage war against Europeans.

President Obama issued a statement condemning the killings. ""Time and again, the French people have stood up for the universal values that generations of our people have defended,"" he said.

""France, and the great city of Paris where this outrageous attack took place, offer the world a timeless example that will endure well beyond the hateful vision of these killers. We are in touch with French officials, and I have directed my administration to provide any assistance needed to help bring these terrorists to justice.""

78,78,2015-01-21-StateoftheUnion.txt,"

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:

We are 15 years into this new century.  Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world.  It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.

But tonight, we turn the page.  Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.  More of our kids are graduating than ever before.  More of our people are insured than ever before.  And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as weâve been in almost 30 years.

Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.  Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.  And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe.  We are humbled and grateful for your service.

America, for all that we have endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.

At this moment -- with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.  Itâs now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come.

Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?

Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing?  Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?

Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another?  Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?

In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.  And in the months ahead, Iâll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.  So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.

It begins with our economy.  Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.  She waited tables.  He worked construction.  Their first child, Jack, was on the way.  They were young and in love in America.  And it doesnât get much better than that.  âIf only we had known,â Rebekah wrote to me last spring, âwhat was about to happen to the housing and construction market.â 

As the crisis worsened, Benâs business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.  Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.  They sacrificed for each other.  And slowly, it paid off.  They bought their first home.  They had a second son, Henry.  Rebekah got a better job and then a raise.  Ben is back in construction -- and home for dinner every night.

âIt is amazing,â Rebekah wrote, âwhat you can bounce back from when you have toâ¦we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.â  We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.

America, Rebekah and Benâs story is our story.  They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped, and sacrificed and retooled.  You are the reason that I ran for this office.  You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation.  And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.

We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores.  And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.   

We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.  America is number one in wind power.  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump.   

We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.  And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record.  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.  More Americans finish college than ever before.   

We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.  Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.  And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.   

At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.  Instead, weâve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.  This is good news, people.

So the verdict is clear.  Middle-class economics works.  Expanding opportunity works.  And these policies will continue to work as long as politics donât get in the way.  We canât slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.  We canât put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when weâve got to fix a broken system.  And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it.  It will have earned my veto.   

Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.  Wages are finally starting to rise again.  We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employeesâ pay than at any time since 2007.  But hereâs the thing:  Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesnât screw things up; that government doesnât halt the progress weâre making.  We need to do more than just do no harm.  Tonight, together, letâs do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American.   

Because families like Rebekahâs still need our help.  She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but theyâve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.  Friday night pizza, thatâs a big splurge.  Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.  Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isnât asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.

And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.  We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.  We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet -- tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them.

Thatâs what middle-class economics is -- the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules.  We donât just want everyone to share in Americaâs success, we want everyone to contribute to our success. 

So what does middle-class economics require in our time? 

First, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.  That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement.  And my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. 

Hereâs one example.  During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority -- so this country provided universal childcare.  In todayâs economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. 

Itâs not a nice-to-have -- itâs a must-have.  So itâs time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or as a womenâs issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.  And thatâs why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America -- by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. 

Hereâs another example.  Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesnât guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.  Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave -- 43 million.  Think about that.  And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.  So Iâll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.  And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, letâs put it to a vote right here in Washington.  Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.  Itâs the right thing to do.  Itâs the right thing to do. 

Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.  Thatâs why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.  Itâs 2015.  Itâs time.  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime theyâve earned.  And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it.  If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. 

Now, these ideas wonât make everybody rich, wonât relieve every hardship.  Thatâs not the job of government.  To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarterâs earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their companyâs long-term interest.  We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. 

But you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage -- these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.  Thatâs a fact.  And thatâs what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do.

Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.  America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world.  We were ahead of the curve.  But other countries caught on.  And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game.  We need to do more.

By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education -- two in three.  And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.  Itâs not fair to them, and itâs sure not smart for our future.  Thatâs why Iâm sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college -- to zero.   

Keep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college.  Some are young and starting out.  Some are older and looking for a better job.  Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.  Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt.  Understand, youâve got to earn it.  Youâve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. 

Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.  I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.  Letâs stay ahead of the curve.  And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesnât derail anyoneâs dreams.   

Thanks to Vice President Bidenâs great work to update our job training system, weâre connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.  Tonight, Iâm also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships -- opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they donât have a higher education.

And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.  Already, weâve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.  Weâre slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need.  And weâre making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.  And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden -- thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job.  So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:  If you want somebody whoâs going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran. 

Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.  Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. 

Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.  Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.  But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didnât even exist 10 or 20 years ago -- jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla. 

So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.  But we do know we want them here in America.  We know that.  And thatâs why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.

Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure -- modern ports, and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet.  Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.  So letâs set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.  Letâs pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.  Letâs do it.  Letâs get it done.  Letâs get it done. 

Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.  Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.  But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the worldâs fastest-growing region.  That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.  Why would we let that happen?  We should write those rules.  We should level the playing field.  Thatâs why Iâm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that arenât just free, but are also fair.  Itâs the right thing to do. 

Look, Iâm the first one to admit that past trade deals havenât always lived up to the hype, and thatâs why weâve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.  But 95 percent of the worldâs customers live outside our borders.  We canât close ourselves off from those opportunities.  More than half of manufacturing executives have said theyâre actively looking to bring jobs back from China.  So letâs give them one more reason to get it done.

Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development.  I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine -- one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. 

In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable.  So tonight, Iâm launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes, and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.  We can do this. 

I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community -- and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.

I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs -- converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again.  Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay.  Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars.  And in two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space.  So good luck, Captain.  Make sure to Instagram it.  Weâre proud of you.   

Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know thereâs bipartisan support in this chamber.  Members of both parties have told me so.  Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments.  As Americans, we donât mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does, too.  But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.  Theyâve riddled it with giveaways that the super-rich donât need, while denying a break to middle-class families who do.  

This year, we have an opportunity to change that.  Letâs close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest here in America.  Letâs use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.  Letâs simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford.  And letâs close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth.  We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.  We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.  We can achieve it together. 

Helping hardworking families make ends meet.  Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy.  Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness.  This is where America needs to go.  I believe itâs where the American people want to go.  It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. 

Of course, if thereâs one thing this new century has taught us, itâs that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. 

My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America.  In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.  When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military -- then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world.  Thatâs what our enemies want us to do.

I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.  We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we donât let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.  Thatâs exactly what weâre doing right now.  And around the globe, it is making a difference.

First, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists -- from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.  We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies.   

At the same time, weâve learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years.  Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, weâve trained their security forces, who have now taken the lead, and weâve honored our troopsâ sacrifice by supporting that countryâs first democratic transition.  Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, weâre partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. 

In Iraq and Syria, American leadership -- including our military power -- is stopping ISILâs advance.  Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.  Weâre also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. 

Now, this effort will take time.  It will require focus.  But we will succeed.  And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.  We need that authority. 

Second, weâre demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.  Weâre upholding the principle that bigger nations canât bully the small -- by opposing Russian aggression, and supporting Ukraineâs democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.   

Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline states, Mr. Putinâs aggression it was suggested was a masterful display of strategy and strength.  That's what I heard from some folks.  Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters.  Thatâs how America leads -- not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. 

In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.  When what youâre doing doesnât work for 50 years, itâs time to try something new.  And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere.  It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba.  It stands up for democratic values, and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.  And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. 

As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of âsmall steps.â  These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba.  And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs.  Welcome home, Alan.  We're glad you're here. 

Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, weâve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.  Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies -- including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.  There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. 

But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails -- alienating America from its allies; making it harder to maintain sanctions; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again.  It doesnât make sense.  And that's why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.  The American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.

Third, weâre looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.  No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids.  So we're making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. 

And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our childrenâs information.  That should be a bipartisan effort. 

If we donât act, weâll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable.  If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.

In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, our health care workers are rolling back Ebola -- saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease.  I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.  But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.

In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules -- in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief.  And no challenge -- no challenge -- poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.   

2014 was the planetâs warmest year on record.  Now, one year doesnât make a trend, but this does:  14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.  

Iâve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying theyâre not scientists; that we donât have enough information to act.  Well, Iâm not a scientist, either.  But you know what, I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and at NOAA, and at our major universities.  And the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we donât act forcefully, weâll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe.  The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.  We should act like it.   

And thatâs why, over the past six years, weâve done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use it.  Thatâs why weâve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.  And thatâs why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts.  I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action.   

In Beijing, we made a historic announcement:  The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution.  And China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions.  And because the worldâs two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet weâve got.

And thereâs one last pillar of our leadership, and thatâs the example of our values. 

As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when weâre threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.  Itâs why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.  Itâs why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace.  Thatâs why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but because ultimately they will make us safer. 

As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice.  So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.  Since Iâve been President, weâve worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half.  Now it is time to finish the job.  And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.  It is not who we are.  Itâs time to close Gitmo. 

As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks.  So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not.  As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.  And next month, weâll issue a report on how weâre keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.

Looking to the future instead of the past.  Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely.  Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities.  Leading -- always -- with the example of our values.  Thatâs what makes us exceptional.  Thatâs what keeps us strong.  Thatâs why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards -- our own.

You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasnât a liberal America or a conservative America; a black America or a white America -- but a United States of America.  I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home -- a state of small towns, rich farmland, one of the worldâs great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.

Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasnât delivered on this vision.  How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever.  Itâs held up as proof not just of my own flaws -- of which there are many -- but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, naÃ¯ve, that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.

I know how tempting such cynicism may be.  But I still think the cynics are wrong.  I still believe that we are one people.  I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. 

I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best.  Iâve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California, and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, New London.  Iâve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown, in Boston, in West Texas, and West Virginia.  Iâve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.  Iâve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in 10 Americans call home. 

So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who every day live the idea that we are our brotherâs keeper and our sisterâs keeper.  And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. 

So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect Americaâs hopes.  Iâve served in Congress with many of you.  I know many of you well.  There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.  And many of you have told me that this isnât what you signed up for -- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.

Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns.  Imagine if we did something different.  Understand, a better politics isnât one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine.  A better politics is one where we appeal to each otherâs basic decency instead of our basest fears.  A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues and values, and principles and facts, rather than âgotchaâ moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with peopleâs daily lives.   

A politics -- a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America.

If weâre going to have arguments, letâs have arguments, but letâs make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.  We still may not agree on a womanâs right to choose, but surely we can agree itâs a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs.   

Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that itâs possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.  Iâve talked to Republicans and Democrats about that.  Thatâs something that we can share.

We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that itâs being denied to too many -- and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.   

We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York.  But surely we can understand a father who fears his son canât walk home without being harassed.  And surely we can understand the wife who wonât rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.  And surely we can agree that itâs a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform Americaâs criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us.   

Thatâs a better politics.  Thatâs how we start rebuilding trust.  Thatâs how we move this country forward.  Thatâs what the American people want.  And thatâs what they deserve.

I have no more campaigns to run.  My only agenda -- I know because I won both of them.  My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one Iâve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol -- to do what I believe is best for America.  If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand.  If you disagree with parts of it, I hope youâll at least work with me where you do agree.  And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.   

Because I want this chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth -- that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world.

I want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood, your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids.  I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that weâre a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen -- man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino, Asian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability.  Everybody matters.  I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true:  that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.   

I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past six years:  âItâs amazing what you can bounce back from when you have toâ¦we are a strong, tight-knit family whoâs made it through some very, very hard times.â

My fellow Americans, we, too, are a strong, tight-knit family.  We, too, have made it through some hard times.  Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.  We have laid a new foundation.  A brighter future is ours to write.  Letâs begin this new chapter together -- and letâs start the work right now.   

Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless this country we love.  Thank you. 

","President Barack Obama on Tuesday night declared an end to the U.S. economic crisis as he made the case to Americans, and a skeptical Congress, that now was the time to focus on resolving the most stubborn impediment to a full-fledged recovery: lagging progress among the middle class.

""The shadow of crisis has passed,"" Mr. Obama said in his annual State of the Union address, arguing that a revitalized economy should guide Washington leaders to confront what he called ""middle-class economics."" Laying out a broad vision for his last two years in office, Mr. Obama asked lawmakers of both parties to ""commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort.""

""At this moment -- with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth,"" he said.

But Mr. Obama's economic agenda, which hinges on raising taxes on high-income Americans to fund initiatives to benefit those at lower income levels, faces a deeply uncertain path in a Congress that for the first time in his presidency is fully controlled by Republicans.

GOP lawmakers, bolstered by their gains in November's midterm election, dismissed the president's pitch as a recycling of proposals never intended to secure bipartisan support.

""He has ignored the will of the people, instead choosing to offer up the same tired and failed policy proposals we've seen unsuccessfully implemented for the past six years,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.

Mr. Obama, addressing the nation at a moment of emerging economic optimism at home but also heightened anxiety over new threats overseas, called on Congress to show support for the American-led military operation he credited with blunting the advance of Islamic State militants by passing a resolution authorizing the mission.

He also asked lawmakers to pass legislation that would toughen cybersecurity measures to address a rising threat to American security.

But the overarching theme of Mr. Obama's speech was his notion of ""middle-class economics,"" which he described as ""the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot."" His plans include some $235 billion in new spending, which he proposes raising through an increase in top capital-gains tax rates and new taxes on many inheritances, among other measures.

The president's speech emphasized themes important to working parents, particularly women, traditionally a strong component of his party's political base. In addition to highlighting the story of a working mother who was seated with first lady Michelle Obama, the president outlined proposals that would expand child-care tax credits, create a new tax credit for families with two working spouses, and guarantee paid leave for parents with new children.

His economic agenda also relies on changes in housing and education policies. He proposed making community college free for millions of students and earlier this month announced the Federal Housing Administration would cut annual mortgage-insurance premiums to help make homeownership more affordable.

While Republicans and Democrats alike cite a stagnant middle class as the most vexing economic problem facing the nation, GOP lawmakers have long opposed Mr. Obama's call for tax increases on wealthier Americans. Still, the parties' shared interest in speaking more directly to economic anxiety and wage stagnation has the potential to push them to find common ground. Mr. Obama's plan also extends the discussion beyond corporate taxation to include individual taxes, as Republicans want.

New Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Mr. Obama's proposal to raise taxes on high-income Americans -- $320 billion over 10 years -- damped hopes for making progress on an overhaul of the tax code. But underscoring the prospects for deal-making, remote as they may be, Mr. McConnell didn't rule out an eventual compromise on taxes. He also cited trade pacts and cybersecurity legislation as potential areas of agreement with the president.

""The American people aren't demanding talking-point proposals designed to excite the base but not designed to pass"" in Congress, Mr. McConnell said. ""What they said they're hungry for is substance and accomplishment. They want Washington to get back to work and focus on a serious jobs and reform agenda.""

The coming months will tell how far Mr. Obama and GOP leaders might go in pushing their parties' core supporters to compromise for the sake of agreement on taxes and other matters. Mr. Obama has primarily shown interest in pushing his party only on one issue recently -- rules to allow easier passage of trade deals. Only a handful of Democrats have come forward to support the renewal of legislation for trade-promotion authority, known as fast track, which would ease the passage of a trade pact with Japan and 10 other Pacific nations, as well as a trade deal with the European Union.

While his party suffered significant setbacks in the November elections, the president arrived at the Capitol Tuesday night with some political momentum, with the economic outlook brightening and his job-approval ratings ticking upward. Some 46% of Americans approved of Mr. Obama's job performance in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released this week, up from 40% in September.

But despite economic growth and a drop in the unemployment rate, anxiety among middle-class Americans has persisted. Mr. Obama sees the issue as an unfinished piece of his legacy.

Democrats have welcomed the president's proposals for tackling income stagnation and other problems burdening the middle class. ""All the indicators that tell us that progress has been made in our economy -- and indeed it has -- it isn't reflected in the paychecks of America's working families,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Tuesday.

But even before the president spoke Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) made his skepticism clear in a video posted to Facebook in which he said, ""Tonight isn't about the president's legacy; it's about the peoples' priorities. Making government bigger isn't going to help the middle class.""

Mr. Obama on Tuesday also made the case for a host of foreign-policy objectives.

Since last year's State of the Union address, the U.S. has entered into a new war in Iraq and Syria against Islamic State, while Russia has ramped up its intervention in Ukraine and crises have emerged from the Middle East to Africa, from where the spread of Ebola reached the U.S.

On cybersecurity, the president argued, ""If we don't act, we'll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable.""

Mr. Obama asked Congress to hold off on passing additional economic sanctions on Iran until the U.S. and other world powers completed negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program. The deadline for the talks, which have twice been extended, is June.

The president also sharpened his pitch for closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and he argued that his decision to begin normalizing U.S. relations with that island nation was the right move and urged Congress to lift the embargo against Cuba.

Mr. Obama made a push for policies to address climate change, which have drawn a cool response from Republicans. He made clear he intends to block any congressional effort to roll back his executive changes to the immigration system, which offered safe harbor from deportation to millions of illegal immigrants.

He signaled he is inclined to reject the much-debated Keystone XL pipeline unless it is in the context of a broader effort to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. ""Let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,"" Mr. Obama said.


","President Obama claimed credit on Tuesday for an improving economy and defiantly told his Republican adversaries in Congress to ""turn the page"" by supporting an expensive domestic agenda aimed at improving the fortunes of the middle class.

Released from the political constraints of a sagging economy, overseas wars and elections, Mr. Obama declared in his sixth State of the Union address that ""the shadow of crisis has passed,"" and he vowed to use his final two years in office fighting for programs that had taken a back seat.

He called on Congress to make community college free for most students, enhance tax credits for education and child care, and impose new taxes and fees on high-income earners and large financial institutions.

""We have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth,"" Mr. Obama said in an hourlong address to a joint session of Congress seen by an estimated 30 million people. ""Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?""

Confident and at times cocky, the president used the pageantry of the prime-time speech for a defense of an activist federal government. He vowed to continue a foreign policy that combines ""military power with strong diplomacy,"" and he called on Congress to lift the trade embargo on Cuba and pass legislation authorizing the fight against the Islamic State.

He said approval of a resolution granting him that power -- something he has long argued he does not need to carry out the five-month-old campaign -- would send an important signal. ""Tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission,"" Mr. Obama said. ""We need that authority.""

""This effort will take time,"" he said of the battle to defeat the Islamic State, the Sunni militant group that is also known as ISIS or ISIL. ""It will require focus. But we will succeed.""

Mr. Obama met a skeptical but respectful Congress hours after vowing to veto Republican legislation that would restrict abortion and speed the approval of natural gas pipelines, the latest in a series of veto threats that reflect his eagerness to confront conservative ideology.

The president made no mention of the major losses that his party endured in congressional elections last fall, choosing to ignore the assertion by Republicans that voters had rejected his vision. In the speech, he promised that any attempt to roll back his health care law, an overhaul of regulations on Wall Street or his executive actions on immigration would also face vetoes.

Mr. Obama implied that the Republican economic agenda lacked an ambition equal to his own. At one point, he mocked the party's unshakable determination to force approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry 830,000 barrels of petroleum per day from Canada to the Gulf Coast. ""Let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,"" he chided.

Speaker John A. Boehner, behind the president, and a sea of Republican lawmakers facing him in the House chamber sat impassively as Democrats stood to applaud Mr. Obama's recitation of the brightening domestic picture during his presidency. The improvements include job growth, falling deficits and the slowing of the growth of health care costs.

""This is good news, people,"" Mr. Obama interjected at one such moment, looking out at the motionless Republicans.

The president sought to cement an economic legacy that seemed improbable early in his first term, when the country was in near-economic collapse. The speech aimed to live beyond his presidency by helping to starkly define the differences between Democrats and Republicans ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

""The verdict is clear,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way.""

Mr. Obama did highlight some potential areas of collaboration with Republicans. He called on Congress to approve a business tax overhaul, the granting of authority to strike trade deals, and a major initiative to repair crumbling roads and bridges.

But the president vowed to push forward with policies that have generated Republican opposition. He called for aggressive action to fight climate change and said he would not back down on changes to the nation's immigration system. He repeated his support for new regulations on Internet providers and for overriding state laws that limit competition for high-speed service.

In the official Republican response, Senator Joni Ernst, the freshman Republican from Iowa, said, ""Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mind-set that led to failed policies like Obamacare.""

Hitting back at his political opponents and critics, Mr. Obama dismissed as ""cynics"" those who rejected the lofty vision he campaigned on, even as he said he recognized the criticism of his decade-old claim that there is not a ""black America or a white America, but a United States of America."" He urged members of both parties to reach for a better politics, ""one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter.""

He called on his adversaries to ""appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears,"" and he said he longed for a political reality free of ""gotcha moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies."" He said a better politics would allow Republicans and Democrats to come together on reforming the criminal justice system in the wake of killings by police officers in Ferguson, Mo., and on Staten Island.

Mr. Obama's plans -- which would offer free community college for millions of students, paid leave for workers and more generous government assistance for education, child care and retirement savings for the middle class -- are to be financed in large part by $320 billion in tax increases over the next decade on higher income earners as well as a fee on large financial institutions.

The tax plan would raise the top capital gains tax rate to 28 percent, from 23.8 percent. It would also remove what amounts to a tax break for wealthy people who can afford to hold on to their investments until death. Mr. Obama also said he wanted to assess a new fee on the largest financial institutions -- those with assets of $50 billion or more -- based on the amount of risk they took on.

Those proposals would pay for the community college initiative, which would cost $60 billion over a decade, as well as an array of new tax credits intended for the middle class. They include a new $500 credit for families with two working spouses; a subsidy of up to $2,500 annually to pay for college; and the tripling, up to $3,000, of an existing tax break to pay for college.

""It's time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or as a women's issue,"" Mr. Obama said, ""and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.""

Mr. Obama said that the approach of walling off the United States from Cuba had been ineffective, and that it was time to try a new strategy. Seated in the first lady's box overlooking the House chamber, Alan P. Gross, the American prisoner freed in December as part of the new dÃ©tente, repeatedly mouthed ""thank you"" when Mr. Obama recognized him.

The president argued that the United States had an opportunity to strike a deal with Iran to prevent its development of a nuclear weapon, and he made it clear that he opposed legislation -- backed by some Democrats and Republicans -- to impose new sanctions before those talks had played out.

""We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power with coalition building, when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents,"" Mr. Obama said.

And after several high-profile cyberattacks, including one against Sony Pictures that his administration blamed on North Korea, Mr. Obama called for legislation to bolster protections against such computer-enabled assaults.

""No foreign nation, no hacker should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids,"" the president said. ""If we don't act, we'll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.""

79,79,2015-02-14-CybersecuritySummit.txt," Hello Stanford! Thank you so much! Thank you! Thank you so much. Than you, everybody. Have a seat. Have a seat.

""Yes we can.""

First of all, let me thank President Hennessy for not just the introduction but for your outstanding leadership at one of the great universities of the world.  Iâve got to admit, like, I kind of want to go here.  I was trying to figure out why it is that a really nice place like this is wasted on young people -- who donât fully appreciate what you got.  Itâs really nice.  And everybody here is so friendly and smart, and itâs beautiful.  And whatâs there not to like?

I want to thank you and everyone at Stanford for hosting this summit, especially Amy Zegart, George Triantis, and someone who served as a great advisor to me at the White House and as an outstanding ambassador to Russia before coming back to The Farm -- Mike McFaul.

It is great to be here at Leland Stanford Junior University.  And Iâm pleased to be joined by members of my team who bleed Cardinal red.  Weâre infiltrated with Stanford people.  Weâve got Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker.   And, letâs face it, I like Stanford grads.  I noticed Steve Chu was around here, who helped lead our Energy Department for a while.  And heâs now hanging out.  Iâm also pleased to be joined by other members of my Cabinet -- our Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson is here, and our Small Business Administrator, Maria Contreras-Sweet.  And I want to acknowledge my tireless Homeland Security Advisor who helped, and continues to shape, our cybersecurity efforts -- Lisa Monaco.  Thank you, Lisa.  

So Iâd always heard about this campus, and everybody is riding bikes, and people hopping into fountains -- and the current holder of The Axe.  This is the place that made ânerdâ cool.  I was thinking about wearing some black-rimmed glasses, some tape in the middle, but I guess thatâs not what you do anymore.  Ambassador McFaul told me if I came to Stanford, youâd âtalk nerdy to me.â

But Iâm not just here to enjoy myself.  As we gather here today, America is seeing incredible progress that we can all be proud of.  We just had the best year of job growth since the 1990s.  Over the past 59 months, our businesses have created nearly 12 million new jobs, which is the longest streak of private sector job growth on record.  And in a hopeful sign for middle-class families, wages are beginning to rise again.

And, meanwhile, weâre doing more to prepare our young people for a competitive world.  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.  More Americans are finishing college than ever before.  Here at Stanford and across the country, weâve got the best universities, weâve got the best scientists, the best researchers in the world.  Weâve got the most dynamic economy in the world.  And no place represents that better than this region.  So make no mistake, more than any other nation on Earth, the United States is positioned to lead in the 21st century. 

And so much of our economic competitiveness is tied to what brings me here today, and that is Americaâs leadership in the digital economy.  Itâs our ability -- almost unique across the planet -- our ability to innovate and to learn, and to discover, and to create, and build, and do business online, and stretch the boundaries of whatâs possible.  Thatâs what drives us.  And so when we had to decide where to have this summit, the decision was easy, because so much of our Information Age began right here, at Stanford.   

It was here where two students, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, met and then, in a garage not far from here, started a company that eventually built one of the first personal computers, weighing in at 40 pounds.  It was from here, in 1968, where a researcher, Douglas Englebart, astonished an audience with two computers, connected âonline,â and hypertext you could click on with something called a âmouse.â 

A year later, a computer here received the first message from another computer 350 miles away -- the beginnings of what would become the Internet.  And, by the way, itâs no secret that many of these innovations built on government-funded research is one of the reasons that if we want to maintain our economic leadership in the world, America has to keep investing in basic research in science and technology.  It's absolutely critical.

So here at Stanford, pioneers developed the protocols and architecture of the Internet, DSL, the first webpage in America, innovations for cloud computing.  Student projects here became Yahoo and Google.  Those were pretty good student projects.  Your graduates have gone on to help create and build thousands of companies that have shaped our digital society -- from Cisco to Sun Microsystems, YouTube to Instagram, StubHub, Bonobos.  According to one study, if all the companies traced back to Stanford graduates formed their own nation, youâd be one the largest economies in the world and have a pretty good football team as well.

And today, with your cutting-edge research programs and your new cyber initiatives, youâre helping us navigate some of the most complicated cyber challenges that we face as a nation.  And thatâs why weâre here.  I want to thank all of you who have joined us today -- members of Congress, representatives from the private sector, government, academia, privacy and consumer groups, and especially the students who are here.  Just as weâre all connected like never before, we have to work together like never before, both to seize opportunities but also meet the challenges of this Information Age. 

And itâs one of the great paradoxes of our time that the very technologies that empower us to do great good can also be used to undermine us and inflict great harm.  The same information technologies that help make our military the most advanced in the world are targeted by hackers from China and Russia who go after our defense contractors and systems that are built for our troops.  The same social media we use in government to advocate for democracy and human rights around the world can also be used by terrorists to spread hateful ideologies.  So these cyber threats are a challenge to our national security. 

Much of our critical infrastructure -- our financial systems, our power grid, health systems -- run on networks connected to the Internet, which is hugely empowering but also dangerous, and creates new points of vulnerability that we didnât have before.  Foreign governments and criminals are probing these systems every single day.  We only have to think of real-life examples -- an air traffic control system going down and disrupting flights, or blackouts that plunge cities into darkness -- to imagine what a set of systematic cyber attacks might do.  So this is also a matter of public safety.
 
As a nation, we do more business online than ever before -- trillions of dollars a year.  And high-tech industries, like those across the Valley, support millions of American jobs.  All this gives us an enormous competitive advantage in the global economy.  And for that very reason, American companies are being targeted, their trade secrets stolen, intellectual property ripped off.  The North Korean cyber attack on Sony Pictures destroyed data and disabled thousands of computers, and exposed the personal information of Sony employees.  And these attacks are hurting American companies and costing American jobs.  So this is also a threat to Americaâs economic security.

As consumers, we do more online than ever before.  We manage our bank accounts.  We shop.  We pay our bills.  We handle our medical records.  And as a country, one of our greatest resources are the young people who are here today --digitally fearless and unencumbered by convention, and uninterested in old debates.  And theyâre remaking the world every day.  But it also means that this problem of how we secure this digital world is only going to increase. 

I want more Americans succeeding in our digital world.  I want young people like you to unleash the next waves of innovation, and launch the next startups, and give Americans the tools to create new jobs and new businesses, and to expand connectivity in places that we currently can't imagine, to help open up new world and new experiences and empower individuals in ways that would seem unimaginable 10, 15, 20 years ago. 

And thatâs why weâre working to connect 99 percent of Americaâs students to high-speed Internet -- because when it comes to educating our children, we canât afford any digital divides.  Itâs why weâre helping more communities get across to the next generation of broadband faster, with cheaper Internet, so that students and entrepreneurs and small businesses across America, not just in pockets of America, have the same opportunities to learn and compete as you do here in the Valley.  Itâs why Iâve come out so strongly and publicly for net neutrality, for an open and free Internet -- because we have to preserve one of the greatest engines for creativity and innovation in human history.

So our connectivity brings extraordinary benefits to our daily lives, but it also brings risks.  And when companies get hacked, Americansâ personal information, including their financial information, gets stolen.  Identity theft can ruin your credit rating and turn your life upside down.  In recent breaches, more than 100 million Americans had their personal data compromised, including, in some cases, credit card information.  We want our children to go online and explore the world, but we also want them to be safe and not have their privacy violated.  So this is a direct threat to the economic security of American families, not just the economy overall, and to the wellbeing of our children, which means weâve got to put in place mechanisms to protect them.

So shortly after I took office, before I had gray hair -- I said that these cyber threats were one of the most serious economic national security challenges that we face as a nation, and I made confronting them a priority.  And given the complexity of these threats, I believe we have to be guided by some basic principles.  So let me share those with you today.

First, this has to be a shared mission.  So much of our computer networks and critical infrastructure are in the private sector, which means government cannot do this alone.  But the fact is that the private sector canât do it alone either, because itâs government that often has the latest information on new threats.  Thereâs only one way to defend America from these cyber threats, and that is through government and industry working together, sharing appropriate information as true partners.  

Second, we have to focus on our unique strengths.  Government has many capabilities, but itâs not appropriate or even possible for government to secure the computer networks of private businesses.  Many of the companies who are here today are cutting-edge, but the private sector doesnât always have the capabilities needed during a cyber attack, the situational awareness, or the ability to warn other companies in real time, or the capacity to coordinate a response across companies and sectors.  So weâre going to have to be smart and efficient and focus on what each sector does best, and then do it together.

Third, weâre going to have to constantly evolve.  The first computer viruses hit personal computers in the early 1980s, and essentially, weâve been in a cyber arms race ever since.  We design new defenses, and then hackers and criminals design new ways to penetrate them.  Whether itâs phishing or botnets, spyware or malware, and now ransomware, these attacks are getting more and more sophisticated every day.  So weâve got to be just as fast and flexible and nimble in constantly evolving our defenses.  

And fourth, and most importantly, in all our work we have to make sure we are protecting the privacy and civil liberty of the American people.  And we grapple with these issues in government.  Weâve pursued important reforms to make sure we are respecting peoplesâ privacy as well as ensuring our national security.  And the private sector wrestles with this as well.  When consumers share their personal information with companies, they deserve to know that itâs going to be protected.  When government and industry share information about cyber threats, weâve got to do so in a way that safeguards your personal information.  When people go online, we shouldnât have to forfeit the basic privacy weâre entitled to as Americans. 

In recent years, weâve worked to put these principles into practice.  And as part of our comprehensive strategy, weâve boosted our defenses in government, weâre sharing more information with the private sector to help those companies defend themselves, weâre working with industry to use what we call a Cybersecurity Framework to prevent, respond to, and recover from attacks when they happen.

And, by the way, I recently went to the National Cybersecurity Communications Integration Center, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, where representatives from government and the private sector monitor cyber threats 24/7.  And so defending against cyber threats, just like terrorism or other threats, is one more reason that we are calling on Congress, not to engage in politics -- this is not a Republican or Democratic issue -- but work to make sure that our security is safeguarded and that we fully fund the Department of Homeland Security, because it has great responsibilities in this area.

So weâre making progress, and Iâve recently announced new actions to keep up this momentum.  Weâve called for a single national standard so Americans know within 30 days if your information has been stolen.  This month, weâll be proposing legislation that we call a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to give Americans some baseline protections, like the right to decide what personal data companies collect from you, and the right to know how companies are using that information.  Weâve proposed the Student Digital Privacy Act, which is modeled on the landmark law here in California -- because todayâs amazing educational technologies should be used to teach our students and not collect data for marketing to students.

And weâve also taken new steps to strengthen our cybersecurity -- proposing new legislation to promote greater information sharing between government and the private sector, including liability protections for companies that share information about cyber threats.  Today, Iâm once again calling on Congress to come together and get this done.

And this week, we announced the creation of our new Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center.  Just like we do with terrorist threats, weâre going to have a single entity thatâs analyzing and integrating and quickly sharing intelligence about cyber threats across government so we can act on all those threats even faster.
 
And today, weâre taking an additional step -- which is why thereâs a desk here.  You were wondering, I'm sure.  Iâm signing a new executive order to promote even more information sharing about cyber threats, both within the private sector and between government and the private sector.  And it will encourage more companies and industries to set up organizations -- hubs -- so you can share information with each other.  It will call for a common set of standards, including protections for privacy and civil liberties, so that government can share threat information with these hubs more easily.  And it can help make it easier for companies to get the classified cybersecurity threat information that they need to protect their companies.

I want to acknowledge, by the way, that the companies who are represented here are stepping up as well.  The Cyber Threat Alliance, which includes companies like Palo Alto Networks and Symantec, are going to work with us to share more information under this new executive order.  Youâve got companies from Apple to Intel, from Bank of America to PG&E, who are going to use the Cybersecurity Framework to strengthen their own defenses.  As part of our BuySecure Initiative, Visa and MasterCard and American Express and others are going to make their transactions more secure.  Nationstar is joining companies that are giving their companies [customers] another weapon to battle identity theft, and that's free access to their credit scores. 
And more companies are moving to new, stronger technologies to authenticate user identities, like biometrics -- because itâs just too easy for hackers to figure out usernames and passwords, like âpassword.â  Or â12345 -- 7.â   Those are some of my previous passwords.  I've changed them since then.

So this summit is an example of what we need more of -- all of us working together to do what none of us can achieve alone.  And it is difficult.  Some of the challenges Iâve described today have defied solutions for years.  And I want to say very clearly that, as somebody who is a former constitutional law teacher, and somebody who deeply values his privacy and his familyâs privacy -- although I chose the wrong job for that -- but will be a private citizen again, and cares deeply about this -- I have to tell you that grappling with how government protects the American people from adverse events while, at the same time, making sure that government itself is not abusing its capabilities is hard. 

The cyber world is sort of the wild, wild West.  And to some degree, we're asked to be the sheriff.  When something like Sony happens, people want to know what can government do about this.  If information is being shared by terrorists in the cyber world and an attack happens, people want to know are there ways of stopping that from happening.  By necessity, that means government has its own significant capabilities in the cyber world.  But then people, rightly, ask, well, what safeguards do we have against government intruding on our own privacy?  And it's hard, and it constantly evolves because the technology so often outstrips whatever rules and structures and standards have been put in place, which means that government has to be constantly self-critical and we have to be able to have an open debate about it.   

But weâre all here today because we know that we're going to have to break through some of these barriers that are holding us back if we are going to continue to thrive in this remarkable new world.  We all know what we need to do.  We have to build stronger defenses and disrupt more attacks.  We have to make cyberspace safer.  We have to improve cooperation across the board.  And, by the way, this is not just here in America, but internationally -- which also, by the way, makes things complicated because a lot of countries don't necessarily share our investment -- or our commitment to openness, and we have to try to navigate that.

But this should not be an ideological issue.  And thatâs one thing I want to emphasize:  This is not a Democratic issue, or a Republican issue.  This is not a liberal or conservative issue.  Everybody is online, and everybody is vulnerable.  The business leaders here want their privacy and their children protected, just like the consumer and privacy advocates here want America to keep leading the world in technology and be safe from attacks.  So Iâm hopeful that through this forum and the work that we do subsequently, that we're able to generate ideas and best practices, and that the work of this summit can help guide our planning and execution for years to come. 

After all, we are just getting started.  Think about it.  Tim Berners-Lee, from his lab in Switzerland, invented the World Wide Web in 1989, which was only 26 years ago.  The great epochs in human history -- the Bronze Age, Iron Age, Agricultural Revolution, Industrial Revolution -- they spanned centuries.  Weâre only 26 years into this Internet Age.  Weâve only scratched the surface.  And as I guess they say at Google, âThe future is awesome.â  We havenât even begun to imagine the discoveries and innovations that are going to be unleashed in the decades to come.  But we know how weâll get there. 

Reflecting on his work in the 1960s on ARPANET, the precursor of the Internet, the late Paul Baran said this:  âThe process of technological developments is like building a cathedral.  Over the course of several hundred years, new people come along and each lays down a block on top of the old foundations, each saying, âI built the cathedral.â  And then comes along an historian who asks, âWell, who built the cathedral?ââ  And Baran said, âIf youâre not careful, you can con yourself into believing that you did the most important part.  But the reality is that each contribution has to follow on to previous work.  Everything is tied to everything else.â

Everything is tied to everything else.  The innovations that first appeared on this campus all those decades ago -- that first mouse, that first message -- helped lay a foundation.  And in the decades since, on campuses like this, in companies like those that are represented here, new people have come along, each laying down a block, one on top of the other.  And when future historians ask who built this Information Age, it wonât be any one of us who did the most important part alone.  The answer will be, âWe all did, as Americans.â

And Iâm absolutely confident that if we keep at this, if we keep working together in a spirit of collaboration, like all those innovators before us, our work will endure, like a great cathedral, for centuries to come.  And that cathedral will not just be about technology, it will be about the values that weâve embedded in the architecture of this system.  It will be about privacy, and it will be about community.  And it will be about connection.  What a magnificent cathedral that all of you have helped to build.  We want to be a part of that, and we look forward to working with you in the future.

Thank you for your partnership.  With that, Iâm going to sign this executive order.

Thank you.
","For a moment here Friday, it was the chief executive of Apple Inc. vs. the president of the United States.

Speaking just before Barack Obama at a conference on computer security, the iPhone maker's Tim Cook gave perhaps one of the most impassioned defenses of digital privacy from a corporate executive -- in this case the CEO of the world's most valuable company.

It was a pointed welcome for Mr. Obama, and a reminder that technology giants remain distrustful of government efforts to collect their users' data.

""If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money,"" Mr. Cook said. ""We risk our way of life.""

Mr. Cook's remarks reflect the serious challenge Washington faces as it grapples with another problem of the digital era: cybersecurity. The government is trying to push private firms to share more data about the computer threats they face.

On Friday, Mr. Obama signed an executive order meant to make it easier for companies to do so -- such as quicker security clearances for some executives.

""This has to be a shared mission,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Government cannot do this alone. The fact is, the private sector can't do it alone either.""

On its face, protecting companies from hackers would seem to have nothing to do with spying by the National Security Agency, which has become a bit of a curse word in Silicon Valley following the leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. But the U.S. intelligence community is in the sometimes awkward position of helping defend America's most critical computer networks while also using hackers' tools to spy on others, including -- as the NSA revelations showed -- Americans.

As a result, for some executives, working with the government on blocking hackers is the same as working with the agencies that try to keep tabs on their customers and users.

Mr. Obama nodded toward that issue, but didn't back down from his defense of three-letter agencies.

""People rightly ask what safeguards we have against government intruding"" on the privacy of citizens, Mr. Obama said. ""It's hard.""

Apple's Mr. Cook has been in a tangle with Washington since his company in September unveiled new encryption tools that in some cases make it very difficult for law enforcement to collect evidence from iPhones. In a short speech, he alluded to such absolute privacy protections that leave people free to ""practice their religion, express their opinion or love who they choose."" (The Apple CEO recently announced that he is gay.)

The privacy concerns at times overshadowed a primary goal of the summit, which was meant to prod the government and business leaders to share more information with each other about potential hacks.

During two panels of executives in the morning, multiple CEOs implored the government to share more information about threats or classified intelligence that could prevent a future breach.

""The government needs to aggressively share with the private sector in an appropriate manner the indicators of an attack,"" said American Express Co. CEO Kenneth Chenault.

Anthony Earley Jr., CEO of utility company PG&E Corp., said: ""This work cannot be adversarial. We have enough adversaries out there.""

But the issue of the NSA loomed large at Stanford University, the host of the conference.

Attendees went so far as to set up locked wireless networks with mysterious -- though presumably untruthful -- names, such as ""FBI Surveillance Van"" and ""NSA Surveillance Van.""
","Declaring that the Internet has become the ""Wild Wild West"" with consumers and industries as top targets, President Obama on Friday called for a new era of cooperation between the government and the private sector to defeat a range of fast-evolving online threats.

Mr. Obama signed an executive order urging companies to join information-sharing hubs to exchange data on online threats -- and, in some cases, to receive classified information from the government. But the order stopped short of exempting the companies from liability if the data they collected and shared led to legal action.

Only legislation, which Mr. Obama has tried and failed to get through Congress for three years, can exempt the companies from such liability. Many companies outside the financial industry have been reluctant to share data without such a law in place.

Mr. Obama deliberately chose Stanford University as the site of the first summit meeting on online security and consumer protection, saying that it was where much of the Internet was born and is also where the innovations to secure it must be developed.

""The very technologies that can empower us to do great good can also be used to undermine us and do great harm,"" Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama also made clear that his six years of presidency had given him new appreciation of how the government will be called upon to protect citizens against the most severe attacks, and once again accused North Korea of hacking into Sony Pictures. ""The cyberworld is the Wild Wild West -- to some degree we're asked to be the sheriff,"" he said. ""When something like Sony happens, people want to know what the government can do about this.""

Mr. Obama arrived in the heart of Silicon Valley at a time of great tension with companies here, including Apple and Google, both represented at the event. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was seated to Mr. Obama's left Friday afternoon at a closed-door lunch meeting with senior executives, only months after coming into direct conflict with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and intelligence agencies over the full encryption of its mobile devices.

Mr. Obama's intelligence and law enforcement aides would like to preserve access to all digital communication with a court order. The companies say that would create a breach that China and Russia, among others, would exploit.

Mr. Cook, who was invited to the meeting to discuss Apple's new payment system, Apple Pay, used the occasion to urge government and technology leaders to do everything they can to protect users' rights to privacy and security.

""People have entrusted us with their most personal and precious information,"" Mr. Cook said. ""We owe them nothing less than the best protections that we can possibly provide.""

Failing to do so, Mr. Cook said, would ""risk our way of life.""

The private sector has largely been reluctant to share information about threats with the government, arguing that it would create onerous regulations and potentially compromise proprietary and customer data.

Joseph M. Demarest Jr., assistant director of the F.B.I.'s cyberdivision, said in an interview that given the sophistication of the hackers American companies are up against, information-sharing had proved critical to tracing attacks back to hackers and ridding them from systems.

""We're fighting Ph.D.s on the other side of the world,"" Mr. Demarest said. ""Not only the F.B.I., but our colleagues from the intelligence community, can enable and assist not only with attribution but with kicking actors out and keeping them out.""

After the Sony attacks late last year, Mr. Demarest said the F.B.I.'s presence at Sony's headquarters was crucial in helping the government trace the attacks back to North Korea.

""Companies are realizing there is a benefit to keeping us involved,"" he said.

But businesses reeling from the fallout of the revelations about online surveillance from the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden worry about the impression such sharing would create among customers. Foreign governments are worried that such arrangements will compromise their data.

Privacy activists say the approach is misguided. ""Key to security is to minimize data collection and adopt robust security measures,"" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ""If they can't protect it, they shouldn't collect it.""

But few of those tensions were on display on Friday, as Mr. Obama, government officials and a carefully curated list of executives from the technology, banking, energy and health care sectors took the stage to speak for the need for greater public-private partnership in combating online threats.

""This work cannot be adversarial; we have enough adversaries out there,"" Anthony Earley Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Pacific Gas & Electric, said on stage Friday.

Many companies point out that they already share information with others in their industries through industry-specific instruments, notably the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a group that shares threats with members of the banking industry.

And companies have been particularly reluctant, after the Snowden revelations, to do anything to aggravate concerns abroad that they are sharing data on foreigners with intelligence agencies.

To assuage those concerns, Bernard Tyson, the chairman of Kaiser Permanente, tried to distinguish the kinds of data his corporation would share with the government.

""I am not talking about sharing the actual content that I am here to protect,"" Mr. Tyson said. ""It is sharing what I am learning about people trying to get at that content. It's important for me to say that because that is the sensitivity I hear every day.""

Not mentioned at the event was the issue that has most roiled companies in Silicon Valley. Disclosures by Mr. Snowden showed that intelligence agencies were surreptitiously siphoning off customer data from companies like Google and Yahoo as it flowed internally between their data centers.

That information created an atmosphere of distrust that executives say will make information-sharing much more difficult.

""The tricky thing with information-sharing is that it is about trust,"" Eric Grosse, Google's vice president of security, said in an interview earlier this week. ""Information-sharing becomes pretty hard to do once trust is lost.""

80,80,2015-03-11-FinancialAid.txt,"Letâs give it up for Buzz and the Georgia Tech Band for getting us fired up.  Also give it up for Governor Nathan Deal, who is here.  Congressmen Hank Johnson and David Scott.  Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.  And the President of this great institution, Georgia Tech, Bud Peterson.  Thatâs good.  Youâve got a high approval rating.  You do.  Absolutely. 

We also have a special guest with us -- this is a proud Georgia Tech alum, who just happens also to be the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Sandy Winnefeld is here.  Whereâs Sandy?  There he is.  Before he was the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he was a Navy fighter pilot, which is cooler.  Now he just goes to meetings.  Whatâs up with that?  I told him heâs got to get back on a plane. 

It is great to be at one of the finest technical institutes in the world.   One of the finest in the world.  I mean, youâve got to be if the Ramblinâ Wreck is still running after all these years.  Thatâs a Georgia Tech reference that some of you may not know.  I also know that Georgia Tech is terrific because weâve actually worked with you on several fronts -â from promoting advanced manufacturing to unlocking the mysteries of the brain to helping more students become entrepreneurs.

And the reason I wanted to come here today is because I believe that higher education, as you believe, is one of the best investments that anybody can make in their future.  And itâs also one of the best investments you can make in our countryâs future.  So Iâm here to say thank you and to tell you Iâm proud of you, because I know that itâs not always easy to do what youâre doing.  It takes perseverance.  A lot of late nights in the library and the lab, and youâre wrapping your minds around complex formulas and concepts that, frankly, I donât understand.  But I know theyâre complex.  And some of you are holding jobs down at the same time, which makes it even harder. 

But as frustrating as it may be, and Tiffany expressed some frustrations on occasion, it is worth it.  Higher education has never been more important.  And the message I want to deliver today, not just to you but to the entire country, is the entire nation has to treat it as a priority.

Right now, our economy is growing steadily.  It's creating new jobs.  Youâre going to be going into a job market thatâs much better than the one that existed when I came into office six years ago.  After the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, over the past five years, our businesses have now created 12 million new jobs.  Unemployment continues to come down, and obviously thatâs good news for those of you who are graduating soon.  Yes, thatâs right, you want a job.  Your parents also want you to have a job.  They donât want you on the couch.

But I didnât run for President just to get us back to where we were -â I ran for President to get us to where we need to go.  And where we need to go is a growing middle class with rising incomes and opportunities for everybody whoâs willing to work hard.  An America where no matter who you are, what you look like, where you came from, how you started, who you love, what faith youâre a part of, you can make it in this country if you try.  Thatâs what America is all about.

And today, a college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class and beyond.  Itâs the key to getting a good job that pays a good income.  And it offers a measure of security, because a college degree tells employers that you donât just have one set of skills; that youâve got the continuous capacity to learn new skills, which is going to be particularly important for your generation because the economy is going to churn and change in ways that none of us can even anticipate.

Before we came out here, I was talking to a group, including Sandy Winnefeld, and your Mayor Kasim Reed, Tyler Perry buddies -- he wasnât in Madea, he was Tyler.  And we were talking about how rapidly the technology is transforming everything we understand, everything we know --everything from drones, to artificial intelligence, to driver-less cars.  And we donât yet know how all that is going to shape the nation that you inherit, but we know it's going to shape it dramatically.  And in order for you to be able to be successful, youâre going to have to adapt, continuously.  The days where you work at one place for 30, 40 years, those days are over.

And so the skillsets you are getting now are going to keep you in that job market.  Youâre going to have multiple jobs before youâre 30.  Some of you will have multiple careers.  And we live in a 21st-century economy, where your most valuable asset is your imagination, your knowledge, your ability to analyze tough problems.  And thatâs not just true for individual Americans, itâs true for our whole country.

The ability to compete in the global economy depends on us having the worldâs most skilled, best-educated workforce.  And by the way, let me just add, itâs also going to be critical for us to maintain our democracy in a complex, diverse society.

Understandably, when I come to college campuses, thereâs a lot of just bread and butter, nuts and bolts, how does this translate into jobs, careers.  But part of what has made America the exceptional nation that it is, is our diversity and our ability to draw from every corner of the world -- all the talent, all the ideas -- and create this amazing stew.  And the more complex this society, the tougher that becomes.

And so to have all of you possess the ability to listen and to learn from people who arenât like you -- thatâs also what youâre learning here, and thatâs going to make you more effective to every employer out there.  But itâs also -- itâs going to make you better citizens, and itâs going to make our democracy function better. 

But back to the jobs thing.  Jobs and businesses will go wherever the best workers are.  And I donât want them to have to look any further than the United States of America.  I want businesses investing here.  I want Americans getting those new jobs.  Thatâs how weâre going to lead the world in this century just like we did in the 20th century.

So hereâs the challenge:  Higher education has never been more important, but itâs also never been more expensive.  The average undergrad who borrows money to pay for college graduates with about $28,000 in student loan debt.  Thatâs just the average; some students end up with a lot more than that -- you know who you are.  Iâm not telling you anything you donât know. 

And let me say that itâs been established time and time again that Georgia Tech is one of the best bargains around.  You are getting a great education for a great value.  Which is one of the reasons Iâm here; obviously, I wouldnât go to a place that was a bad bargain and really expensive and no value.  That would not make sense.

But even here at Georgia Tech, even with the great value it is, itâs expensive.  And Iâm here to tell you, Iâm with you.  I believe that America is not a place where higher education is a privilege that is reserved for the few.  America needs to be a place where higher education has to be available for every single person whoâs willing to strive for it -- whoâs willing to work for it.

And Iâve said this before:  I take this personally.  My grandfather had a chance to go to college because this country decided that when veterans returned home from World War II, they should be able to go to college.  And this government stepped up.

My mother was able to raise two kids by herself, in part because she got grants that helped pay for her education.  And I am only standing here -â and Michelle is only where she is today â- because of scholarships and student loans and work study.  We did not come from families of means.  We didn't come from families of means, but we knew that if we worked hard, there was help out there to make sure we got a great education.  Thatâs what this country gave to us.

And thatâs why this has been such a priority for me.  I take it personally because when I look out at all of you, I see myself.  And I remember the fact that it took me 10 years to pay off all our student loans.  We were paying more for our student loans than our mortgage, even after Malia and Sasha were born.  We were supposed to be saving for their college education; we were still paying off ours.

And that's why weâve acted again and again to make college more affordable.  Five years ago this month, we enacted the largest reforms to the student loan program in history.  We cut out the big banks that were taking taxpayer dollars and serving as middlemen in the student loan game, and we said, well, letâs just give the money directly to the students like you.

So as a result of that change, we saved billions of dollars.  We were to expand tax credits and Pell grants, and put college within reach for millions more middle-class and low-income students across the country.  Then we fought to keep interest rates on student rates -- interest rates on student loans low and capped how high those rates can rise.  And as a result, the typical undergrad is saving about $1,500.  We also acted to let millions of graduates cap their loan payments at 10 percent of their incomes, so they donât have to choose between paying the rent and paying back their debt.

And by the way, everybody here, if you don't already know about the Income-Based Repayment Program, you need to learn about it because itâs still under-utilized.  But it gives you an opportunity to make sure that if you make a career choice that doesn't make tons of money, you're still able to do the responsible thing and pay back your loans at a pace that also allows you to build a family and buy a home and live your lives.

And graduates who go into lower-paying fields like social work or teaching, they're not going to pay a price for following their dreams because they're going to have even better options in terms of how they repay their loans.  So that's what we did on the student loan side. 

Meanwhile, weâre working to hold down the cost of a college education.  So weâre partnering with schools like Georgia Tech on innovative ways to increase value -â like your online masterâs program in computer science -- which costs just a fraction of the price of an in-classroom program. 
And I sent Congress a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college to zero.  Because not everybody may be prepared right away to start a four-year university.  But also, in some cases, even if they could, they may choose to get two years of college free, and then be able to transfer the credits for their four-year education.  We want to make community college, at minimum, just as free and universal as high school is today.  That should be our new baseline.  We want to get out ahead of the curve in terms of where we need to go.

Earlier today, I took a new action to make it easier for students to pay for college and pay off their loans.  Weâre creating a way for you to ask questions about your loans, file a complaint, cut through the bureaucracy, get a faster response.  Thatâs not just from the government, thatâs also from the contractors who sometimes service your loans.  Weâre going to require that the businesses that service your loans provide clear information about how much you owe, what your options are for repaying it, and if youâre falling behind, help you get back in good standing with reasonable fees on a reasonable timeline.  And if youâre paying stuff off, you should be paying off the high-interest loans first, not the low-interest ones.  Weâre going to take a hard look at whether we need new laws to strengthen protections for all borrowers, wherever you get your loans from.

So weâre trying to tackle this problem from every angle.  Thereâs no silver bullet.  But weâre trying to make sure that across the board, more and more young people can afford to go to college, and then afterwards, arenât so burdened with debt that you canât do anything else.  We want to make this experience more affordable because youâre not just investing in yourselves, youâre investing in your nation.

But hereâs the thing:  Weâve got more to do, all of us -- universities, students, parents, financial institutions and, yes, the government, to make sure that youâre not saddled with debt before you even get started in life.  Thatâs something thatâs in all of our interests. 

Now, my friends, the Republicans in Congress, are planning to unveil their budget soon.  Iâm hoping they have something to offer that will help hardworking young people.  So far, the education bill that they put forward a couple weeks ago is not a good template, itâs not a good start.  Iâm hoping it will improve because right now, the way itâs structured, it would let states and cities shuffle education dollars into things like sports stadiums or tax cuts for the wealthy instead of schools.  And it would allow states to make even deeper cuts into school districts that need the most support, send even more money to the most well-off school districts.  Weâd invest less per child by the end of the decade than we do now.  So itâs the wrong approach.  Weâve got to be working to make sure every child gets a quality education, every student can afford college.

And so weâre going to be reaching out to them, trying to get them to see this is a good investment in our economy, itâs a good investment in our national security.  The way that you keep America safe, one of the best, most important ways is to make sure weâve got a strong economy with a strong workforce.  And all of us have a role to play in making that happen. 

So in order to spur more of a conversation to get more folks engaged, weâre going to try something new to help do this.  Itâs not a fancy new program.  Itâs not -- it doesnât have a complicated acronym.  It doesnât involve new spending or bureaucracy.  Itâs just a simple organizing principle that I want all of us to sign onto, a declaration of values â- what Iâm calling a Student Aid Bill of Rights. 

And it says every student deserves access to a quality, affordable education.  Every student should be able to access the resources to pay for college.  Every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan.  Every borrower has the right to quality customer service, reliable information, and fair treatment, even if they struggle to repay their loans. 

Itâs a simple set of principles that if everybody signed onto -- Republicans, Democrats, state legislators, university presidents, members of Congress -- it can focus our attention, all these different things that weâre doing, into one simple, basic idea, which is, make sure that when youâre doing the right thing, that your society has got your back and is looking out for you.

So based on this principle, weâre going to make sure universities are using technology to help students learn at lower costs.  Weâre going to make sure that loan servicers can find better ways to help borrowers keep up with monthly payments that they can afford.  We as a country can do more to invest in Pell grants and community college to make sure quality education is affordable for everybody. 

So weâre going to just keep on moving on every front.  And we want everybody who agrees with these principles to sit down and work with us, and figure out how they can make these student rights real.  And youâve got a part to play as well. 

We had the great honor of being at Selma this past weekend for the 50th anniversary of the March from Selma.  And one of the main points I think that all of us made was change doesnât happen by itself; it happens because people get organized and mobilized and focused, and they push, and sometimes they disrupt and they make folks uncomfortable, and they ask questions about why is it this way instead of that way. 

And I want us to think about access to higher education and affordability of higher education in that same way.  I want us to all organize together -- not on a partisan basis, itâs not organizing around an election, itâs organizing around a simple idea that everybody should be able to get behind. 

And youâre going to have to play the part.  Because what we also made the point of this past weekend is young people typically lead the pack with new ideas, with new initiatives, with new focus, with a new vision.

So if you agree with the basic values that I outlined, if you believe in a Student Aid Bill of Rights that will help more Americans pay for a quality education, then sign your name to this declaration. 

You can go to a website, because you guys like tech stuff. You go to: WhiteHouse.gov/CollegeOpportunity -- WhiteHouse.gov/CollegeOpportunity.  Tell your families and classmates and professors to do it.  Iâm going to ask members of Congress, and lenders, and as many business leaders as I can find to sign up.

Weâre going to mobilize a coalition around this country to get this process moving, because there are a lot of good ideas right now but theyâre stalled, or theyâre happening piecemeal, or theyâre happening in one university, or theyâre happening in one state, and they have to happen everywhere.  And weâve got to mobilize the entire nation to make that happen.  And it's going to start with students themselves, because if you arenât asking for something different, if you arenât asking for help, if youâre not getting mobilized, then folks arenât going to help you, and then youâll just be complaining -- especially once you graduate and you start having to write those checks.

So donât stop engaging in this issue, even after you graduate, because youâll be still impacted by it.  And in the meantime, youâve got to study hard, and work hard, and have fun.  Make some new discoveries.  Inspire us.  Lead us.  Be the Americans that we need you to be. 

Every American should have the right to go as far as their talents and hard work will take them.  That is what college is all about.  That is what America is all about.  And you embody that basic notion.  You are that talent.  You are an embodiment of what we hope for:  A country that says that everybody, rich, poor, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, gay, straight, man, woman, with disabilities, without -- no matter who you are or where you come from, not only can you succeed but you can help everybody else succeed.  Thatâs the promise that helped us become the greatest nation in the world.  Thatâs the promise that I need you working for. 

Thank you, everybody.  God bless you.  Thank you, Georgia.
","The White House is weighing steps to make it easier for Americans to expunge certain student loans through bankruptcy, opening the door for student debt made by private lenders to be treated on par with credit-card debt and mortgages.

Federal law prohibits student loans, from private lenders and from the U.S. government, from being wiped out in bankruptcy, except in rare circumstances. Other forms of consumer credit such as mortgages, credit-card balances and auto loans face looser requirements for being discharged in bankruptcy.

President Barack Obama on Tuesday directed administration officials to study whether to expand bankruptcy options for ""all student loan borrowers."" An administration official said the bankruptcy review would likely focus on whether to expand bankruptcy options for borrowers with student loans made by private lenders -- such as SLM Corp.'s Sallie Mae and Wells Fargo & Co. -- that aren't backed by the government.

Private loans make up about 10% of all student loans, with the remaining 90% made by the federal government.

Any bankruptcy-law changes would have to be approved by the Republican-controlled Congress, which has broadly opposed the president's agenda.

Expanding bankruptcy options for some student debt would come as the government also is expanding programs that lower students' monthly payments and ultimately forgives some debt. The lending industry has argued that loosening the student-loan rules would drive up borrowing costs for everyone.

Total student debt has more than doubled since 2007, and nearly a quarter of borrowers out of school now are behind on payments, Federal Reserve data show. And while the average burden among recent college grads is just under $30,000, a small but growing share owe substantially more than that.

""We're trying to make sure that across the board, more and more young people can afford to go to college, and then afterward, aren't so burdened with debt that you can't do anything else,"" Mr. Obama said Tuesday at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.

The lending industry's main trade group, the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement that less than 3% of Americans with private student loans are in ""financial distress.""

""We are working to provide flexible repayment options to keep them from finding themselves in bankruptcy at all,"" the group said.

Mr. Obama's effort is part of a White House initiative that also includes setting up a system for borrowers to register complaints about the companies that collect student-loan payments on behalf of the government.

Fewer than 1,000 people try to get rid of their student loans every year using bankruptcy in a process that is both expensive and uncertain.


","President Obama on Tuesday signed what he called a ""Student Aid Bill of Rights"" that he said would help students deal with the growing burden of college loans.

With the memorandum, Mr. Obama directed federal agencies to take steps to make it easier for college students to finance their education, pay back their loans and avoid being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lenders.

""We can and should do much more to give students affordable ways to meet their responsibilities and repay their loans,"" Mr. Obama wrote in the executive order. ""Now is the time for stronger protections.""

In an appearance at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Mr. Obama told a crowd of almost 10,000 students that the United States needs to make sure that they are not burdened by tens of thousands of dollars in debt after they leave college.

""Higher education has never been more important, but it's also never been more expensive,"" Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama said the new bill of rights was ""not a fancy new program.""

""It doesn't have a complicated acronym. It doesn't involve new spending,"" he said. But he added that as a declaration of values, it can help guide policy makers to make college more affordable.

The order directs the secretary of education to develop a ""state of the art complaint and feedback system"" that would allow students to easily file grievances about the federal financial aid process.

Mr. Obama's directive would also require federal agencies involved in the distribution of student aid to enhance consumer protections and information disclosure during the financial aid process. And it would create a new task force to monitor student loan performance and trends in borrowing.

Mr. Obama urged members of Congress to invest more money in making college affordable.

""We're going to be reaching out to them, trying to get them to see that this is a good investment,"" Mr. Obama said.

In Washington, aides to House Speaker John A. Boehner praised the president for focusing on the rising costs of college, but criticized Mr. Obama for initially proposing -- then backing off -- a plan to tax 529 college savings plans.

""All that would do is push more families into the borrowing system,"" Mr. Boehner said in a statement emailed to reporters. ""And while 'enhancing' the borrowing experience is all well and good, our goal should be helping parents and students avoid it as best they can.""

The House last week passed a plan to allow college students to use money from their 529 plans to purchase computers and other technology.

While he is in Atlanta, Mr. Obama is scheduled to attend a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser. Aides said he is also participating in an interview with Vice News. White House officials said they expect the interview to be published early next week.

In a post on the Vice News website, Shane Smith, the chief executive, said that he would interview the president about issues of concern to young people.

81,81,2015-04-03-IranNuclearAgreement.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody.  Today, the United States -- together with our allies and partners -- has reached a historic understanding with Iran, which, if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. 

As President and Commander-in-Chief, I have no greater responsibility than the security of the American people.  And I am convinced that if this framework leads to a final, comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies, and our world safer.

This has been a long time coming.  The Islamic Republic of Iran has been advancing its nuclear program for decades.  By the time I took office, Iran was operating thousands of centrifuges, which can produce the materials for a nuclear bomb -- and Iran was concealing a covert nuclear facility.  I made clear that we were prepared to resolve this issue diplomatically, but only if Iran came to the table in a serious way.  When that did not happen, we rallied the world to impose the toughest sanctions in history -- sanctions which had a profound impact on the Iranian economy.

Now, sanctions alone could not stop Iranâs nuclear program. But they did help bring Iran to the negotiating table.  Because of our diplomatic efforts, the world stood with us and we were joined at the negotiating table by the worldâs major powers -- the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, as well as the European Union.

Over a year ago, we took the first step towards todayâs framework with a deal to stop the progress of Iranâs nuclear program and roll it back in key areas.  And recall that at the time, skeptics argued that Iran would cheat, and that we could not verify their compliance and the interim agreement would fail. Instead, it has succeeded exactly as intended.  Iran has met all of its obligations.  It eliminated its stockpile of dangerous nuclear material.  Inspections of Iranâs program increased.  And we continued negotiations to see if we could achieve a more comprehensive deal.

Today, after many months of tough, principled diplomacy, we have achieved the framework for that deal.  And it is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives.  This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.  Iran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history.  So this deal is not based on trust, itâs based on unprecedented verification. 

Many key details will be finalized over the next three months, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed.  But here are the basic outlines of the deal that we are working to finalize.

First, Iran will not be able to pursue a bomb using plutonium, because it will not develop weapons-grade plutonium.  The core of its reactor at Arak will be dismantled and replaced. The spent fuel from that facility will be shipped out of Iran for the life of the reactor.  Iran will not build a new heavy-water reactor.  And Iran will not reprocess fuel from its existing reactors -- ever.

Second, this deal shuts down Iranâs path to a bomb using enriched uranium. Iran has agreed that its installed centrifuges will be reduced by two-thirds.  Iran will no longer enrich uranium at its Fordow facility.  Iran will not enrich uranium with its advanced centrifuges for at least the next 10 years.  The vast majority of Iranâs stockpile of enriched uranium will be neutralized.

Today, estimates indicate that Iran is only two or three months away from potentially acquiring the raw materials that could be used for a single nuclear bomb.  Under this deal, Iran has agreed that it will not stockpile the materials needed to build a weapon.  Even if it violated the deal, for the next decade at least, Iran would be a minimum of a year away from acquiring enough material for a bomb.  And the strict limitations on Iranâs stockpile will last for 15 years.

Third, this deal provides the best possible defense against Iranâs ability to pursue a nuclear weapon covertly -- that is, in secret.  International inspectors will have unprecedented access not only to Iranian nuclear facilities, but to the entire supply chain that supports Iranâs nuclear program -- from uranium mills that provide the raw materials, to the centrifuge production and storage facilities that support the program.  If Iran cheats, the world will know it.  If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it.  Iranâs past efforts to weaponize its program will be addressed.  With this deal, Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world.

So this will be a long-term deal that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb.  There will be strict limits on Iranâs program for a decade.  Additional restrictions on building new facilities or stockpiling materials will last for 15 years.  The unprecedented transparency measures will last for 20 years or more.  Indeed, some will be permanent.  And as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran will never be permitted to develop a nuclear weapon.

In return for Iranâs actions, the international community has agreed to provide Iran with relief from certain sanctions -- our own sanctions, and international sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council.  This relief will be phased as Iran takes steps to adhere to the deal.  If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place.  Meanwhile, other American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, will continue to be fully enforced.

Now, let me reemphasize, our work is not yet done.  The deal has not been signed.  Between now and the end of June, the negotiators will continue to work through the details of how this framework will be fully implemented, and those details matter.  If there is backsliding on the part of the Iranians, if the verification and inspection mechanisms donât meet the specifications of our nuclear and security experts, there will be no deal.  But if we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully.

Given the importance of this issue, I have instructed my negotiators to fully brief Congress and the American people on the substance of the deal, and I welcome a robust debate in the weeks and months to come.  I am confident that we can show that this deal is good for the security of the United States, for our allies, and for the world.

For the fact is, we only have three options for addressing Iranâs nuclear program.  First, we can reach a robust and verifiable deal -- like this one -- and peacefully prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

The second option is we can bomb Iranâs nuclear facilities, thereby starting another war in the Middle East, and setting back Iranâs program by a few years -- in other words, setting it back by a fraction of the time that this deal will set it back.  Meanwhile weâd ensure that Iran would race ahead to try and build a bomb.

Third, we could pull out of negotiations, try to get other countries to go along and continue sanctions that are currently in place or add additional ones, and hope for the best -- knowing that every time we have done so, Iran has not capitulated but instead has advanced its program, and that in very short order, the breakout timeline would be eliminated and a nuclear arms race in the region could be triggered because of that uncertainty.  In other words, the third option leads us very quickly back to a decision about whether or not to take military action, because weâd have no idea what was going on inside of Iran.

Iran is not going to simply dismantle its program because we demand it to do so.  Thatâs not how the world works, and thatâs not what history shows us.  Iran has shown no willingness to eliminate those aspects of their program that they maintain are for peaceful purposes, even in the face of unprecedented sanctions.  Should negotiations collapse because we, the United States, rejected what the majority of the world considers a fair deal, what our scientists and nuclear experts suggest would give us confidence that they are not developing a nuclear weapon, itâs doubtful that we can even keep our current international sanctions in place. 

So when you hear the inevitable critics of the deal sound off, ask them a simple question:  Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the worldâs major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East?  Is it worse than doing what weâve done for almost two decades, with Iran moving forward with its nuclear program and without robust inspections?  I think the answer will be clear.

Remember, I have always insisted that I will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and I will.  But I also know that a diplomatic solution is the best way to get this done, and offers a more comprehensive -- and lasting -- solution.  It is our best option, by far.  And while it is always a possibility that Iran may try to cheat on the deal in the future, this framework of inspections and transparency makes it far more likely that weâll know about it if they try to cheat -- and I, or future Presidents, will have preserved all of the options that are currently available to deal with it.

To the Iranian people, I want to reaffirm what Iâve said since the beginning of my presidency.  We are willing to engage you on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect.  This deal offers the prospect of relief from sanctions that were imposed because of Iranâs violation of international law.  Since Iranâs Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons, this framework gives Iran the opportunity to verify that its program is, in fact, peaceful.  It demonstrates that if Iran complies with its international obligations, then it can fully rejoin the community of nations, thereby fulfilling the extraordinary talent and aspirations of the Iranian people.  That would be good for Iran, and it would be good for the world.

Of course, this deal alone -- even if fully implemented -- will not end the deep divisions and mistrust between our two countries.  We have a difficult history between us, and our concerns will remain with respect to Iranian behavior so long as Iran continues its sponsorship of terrorism, its support for proxies who destabilize the Middle East, its threats against Americaâs friends and allies -- like Israel.  So make no mistake: We will remain vigilant in countering those actions and standing with our allies. 

Itâs no secret that the Israeli Prime Minister and I don't agree about whether the United States should move forward with a peaceful resolution to the Iranian issue.  If, in fact, Prime Minister Netanyahu is looking for the most effective way to ensure Iran doesnât get a nuclear weapon, this is the best option.  And I believe our nuclear experts can confirm that.

More importantly, I will be speaking with the Prime Minister today to make clear that there will be no daylight, there is no daylight, when it comes to our support for Israelâs security and our concerns about Iranâs destabilizing policies and threats toward Israel.  Thatâs why I've directed my national security team to consult closely with the new Israeli government in the coming weeks and months about how we can further strengthen our long-term security cooperation with Israel, and make clear our unshakeable commitment to Israelâs defense.

Today, I also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia to reaffirm our commitment to the security of our partners in the Gulf.  And Iâm inviting the leaders of the six countries who make up the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain -- to meet me at Camp David this spring to discuss how we can further strengthen our security cooperation, while resolving the multiple conflicts that have caused so much hardship and instability throughout the Middle East. 

Finally, itâs worth remembering that Congress has, on a bipartisan basis, played a critical role in our current Iran policy, helping to shape the sanctions regime that applied so much pressure on Iran and ultimately forced them to the table.  In the coming days and weeks, my administration will engage Congress once again about how we can play -- how it can play a constructive oversight role.  Iâll begin that effort by speaking to the leaders of the House and Senate today. 

In those conversations, I will underscore that the issues at stake here are bigger than politics.  These are matters of war and peace, and they should be evaluated based on the facts and what is ultimately best for the American people and for our national security.  For this is not simply a deal between my administration and Iran.  This is a deal between Iran, the United States of America, and the major powers in the world -- including some of our closest allies.  If Congress kills this deal -- not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative -- then itâs the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy.  International unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen.

The American people understand this, which is why solid majorities support a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.  They understand instinctively the words of President Kennedy, who faced down the far greater threat of communism, and said:  âLet us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.â1  The American people remember that at the height of the Cold War, Presidents like Nixon and Reagan struck historic arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, a far more dangerous adversary -- despite the fact that that adversary not only threatened to destroy our country and our way of life, but had the means to do so.  Those agreements were not perfect.  They did not end all threats.  But they made our world safer.  A good deal with Iran will do the same.

Today, Iâd like to express my thanks to our international partners for their steadfastness and their cooperation.  I was able to speak earlier today with our close allies, Prime Minister Cameron and President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, to reaffirm that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder in this effort. 

And most of all, on behalf of our nation, I want to express my thanks to our tireless -- and I mean tireless -- Secretary of State John Kerry and our entire negotiating team.  They have worked so hard to make this progress.  They represent the best tradition of American diplomacy.  Their work -- our work -- is not yet done and success is not guaranteed.  But we have an historic opportunity to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in Iran, and to do so peacefully, with the international community firmly behind us.  We should seize that chance.

Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.
","Iran and six world powers agreed to a path that would block Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, but key points left unresolved in the marathon negotiations and fierce regional and U.S. political opposition suggested major hurdles remain to reaching a final deal.

Officials laid out on Thursday what amounted to goals for a deal by the end of June that would place constraints and controls on Iran's nuclear work for up to 25 years, with severe limits for the first decade.

But it was still unclear how two of the major sticking points in the final days of negotiations would be resolved. One unanswered question was when exactly sanctions would be eased, and the other was how quickly Iran would be able to scale up its nuclear activities after the first decade.

President Barack Obama hailed it as a ""historic understanding"" between two estranged nations. ""I am convinced that if this framework leads to a final, comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies, and our world safer,"" he said from the White House. ""This has been a long time coming.""

Congressional Republicans quickly attacked the framework, suggesting a drawn-out political fight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a deal based on the framework would ""threaten the survival"" of his country.

When the understanding was finally announced two days beyond a March 31 deadline, it contained a surprising amount of detail, given expectations that it would be a more vague political statement.

American officials said the emerging deal, if implemented, would keep Iran at least a year from amassing enough nuclear fuel to develop a nuclear weapon. That is in line with a key Western demand. Iran's so-called breakout time is currently two to three months.

In exchange, the Islamic Republic will be freed from crippling Western sanctions that have cut its oil exports in half over the past two years.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif stressed his country was still committed to developing an industrial-scale nuclear program for peaceful purposes. But he made clear the deal wasn't guaranteed to lead to diplomatic rapprochement between Tehran and Washington, who have been in conflict for nearly 40 years.

""We have serious differences with the United States,"" Mr. Zarif said. ""What I hope is that through courageous implementation of this . . . some of this distrust can be remedied.""

Many of America's closest Mideast allies, particularly Israel and Saudi Arabia, have warned Washington against concluding a deal with Tehran. Arab countries, in particular, worry the U.S. is seeking to forge a closer relationship with Shiite Iran to confront radical Sunni groups, such as Islamic State and al Qaeda.

The agreement announced in Lausanne is expected to have broad impact on the Middle East. Mr. Obama began the negotiations with Tehran in secret, fueling anger in Arab capitals and charges the White House had been operating behind their back. In recent months -- after the talks have gathered pace -- the U.S. war against Islamic State militants has at times placed it on the same side as Iran, particularly in Iraq.

The emerging deal with Iran is also sparking fears that it could fuel an arms race in the region. Officials and royals in Saudi Arabia have said in recent weeks that the kingdom will match any of the nuclear technologies Iran maintains as part of the agreement. Saudi officials have also told U.S. administrations that they could seek to cooperate with Pakistan -- a nuclear weapons state -- to counter Iran.

The Senate is expected to vote April 14 on legislation that would give lawmakers final approval of a deal. The White House has threatened to veto that bill, as well as another that would apply additional sanctions if negotiators don't reach a deal by the end of June.

The U.S. said all U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions against Iran would be lifted once Iran carries out all key steps in the agreement, something that would have to be verified by the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog.

Removal of sanctions could provide a big economic boost for Iran's stagnant economy, Western diplomats have said, allowing a broad range of energy, trade and financial ties to the rest of the world to be re-established.

A wide range of economic and financial sanctions approved by the U.N Security Council would be suspended once Iran implements important elements of the deal. Under the framework, six Security Council resolutions against Iran over its nuclear program would be scrapped.

But a new resolution would be passed which would maintain severe restrictions on sales of material that could be used in Iran's nuclear program. It would also place unspecified limitations on exports of arms to Iran and on materials that can be used in its ballistic missile program.

According to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, European Union and U.S. nuclear-related sanctions on Iran would start to be lifted within four to 12 months of a final deal, but only depending upon how quickly Iran moved to implement its key pledges under the deal.

Under Thursday's agreement, the EU would suspend its economic, energy and banking sanctions which include an oil embargo on Iran. The U.S. would roll back a range of sanctions that penalize U.S. domestic and foreign companies for establishing economic and financial ties with Iran, including with its central bank.

U.S. sanctions tied to terrorism, human rights and its ballistic missiles program, however, would remain in effect. The U.S. wouldn't terminate those sanctions, a move requiring congressional oversight, for ""much of the duration"" of the agreement.

U.S. officials provided a number of important details for the constraints that Iran's nuclear program would face. Iran would see the number of installed centrifuges -- machines used to enrich uranium -- cut from around 19,000 at present to 6,104, of which only 5,060 would be able to operate for the first decade. All of those machines would be older, first-generation centrifuges.

Low-enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear energy while uranium enriched to higher levels can be used to fuel nuclear weapons. Iran has agreed not to enrich uranium to a level above 3.67% for 15 years, significantly lower than the 90% purity needed for weapons grade material. That limitation was stronger than expected.

Enrichment of uranium would only take place at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility. There would be some centrifuges at the heavily fortified, underground nuclear facility of Fordow. Iran would be unable to enrich uranium there and would stock no fissile material at the site.

Iran has also agreed to cap its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to 300 kilograms from the current roughly 10,000 kilograms. It would be limited at that level for 15 years, although it is unclear whether Tehran would ship the material out of the country.

Mr. Obama said he invited the leaders of the countries that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain -- to meet this spring at Camp David, the sprawling presidential retreat in Maryland.

He said he planned to speak with congressional leaders and had spoken with Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday.
","Iran and the United States, along with five other world powers, announced on Thursday a surprisingly specific and comprehensive understanding on limiting Tehran's nuclear program for the next 15 years, though they left several specific issues to a final agreement in June.

After two years of negotiations, capped by eight tumultuous days and nights of talks that appeared on the brink of breakdown several times, Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, announced the plan, which, if carried out, would keep Iran's nuclear facilities open under strict production limits, and which holds the potential of reordering America's relationship with a country that has been an avowed adversary for 35 years.

Mr. Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, a nuclear scientist who played a crucial role in the last stages of the negotiations, said the pact satisfied their primary goal of ensuring that Iran, if it decided to, could not race for a nuclear weapon in less than a year, although those constraints against ""breakout"" would be in effect only for the first decade of the accord.

President Obama, for whom remaking the American relationship with Iran has been a central objective since his 2008 campaign, stepped into the Rose Garden moments later to celebrate what he called ""a historic understanding with Iran."" He warned Republicans in Congress that if they tried to impose new sanctions to undermine the effort, the United States would be blamed for a diplomatic failure.

He insisted that the deal ""cuts off every pathway"" for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and establishes the most intrusive inspection system in history. ""If Iran cheats,"" he said, ""the world will know it.""

Under the accord, Iran agreed to cut the number of operating centrifuges it has by two-thirds, to 5,060, all of them first-generation, and to cut its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium from around 10,000 kilograms to 300 for 15 years. An American description of the deal also referred to inspections ""anywhere in the country"" that could ""investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility."" But in a briefing, American officials talked about setting up a mechanism to resolve disputes that has not been explained in any detail.

In a move not seen since before the Iranian revolution in 1979, and to the surprise of many in both countries, Iranian government broadcasters aired Mr. Obama's comments live. In parts of Tehran, people cheered and honked car horns as they began to contemplate a life without sanctions on oil and financial transactions, though the issue of when the sanctions are to be removed looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30.

If that hurdle and the problem of ridding Iran of its huge nuclear fuel stockpile can be fully resolved in the next three months, the preliminary accord will still need to be sold to Iran's neighbors. The prospect of a deal has inflamed Israel and the Gulf states, alarmed by Iranian muscle-flexing in the Middle East, most recently in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

There is so much concern that Mr. Obama, in a phone call today to King Salman of Saudi Arabia, invited Arab leaders to Camp David this spring to discuss Iran and the turmoil in the region. Analysts have long been worried that Saudi Arabia and other Arab states might mount their own nuclear programs if they decide that Iran is being allowed to retain too much of its nuclear infrastructure.

In a telephone call from Air Force One on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Obama told Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that while the deal was not final, it ""represents significant progress towards a lasting, comprehensive solution that cuts off all of Iran's pathways to a bomb and verifiably ensures the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program going forward,"" according to an account of the conversation from the White House.

Mr. Netanyahu, a strong critic of the deal, was apparently not mollified, and released a statement saying, ""A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.""

Mr. Zarif, for his part, was careful to play down the notion that anything agreed to here would remake the relationship. Any hint of a broader rapprochement is an enormously sensitive issue among hard-liners in the Iranian military and clerical leaders who have made opposition to the United States the centerpiece of their political narratives.

""Iran-U.S. relations have nothing to do with this,"" Mr. Zarif said emphatically at a university here, where the agreement was announced. ""This was an attempt to resolve the nuclear issue."" While saying he hoped the two countries would find a way to melt away their distrust as the agreement was carried out, he hastened to add, ""We have serious differences with the United States.""

Now, attention will shift to Mr. Obama and Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, who was elected on a platform of ending sanctions. They share a common task: selling the agreement at home to constituencies deeply suspicious of both the deal and the prospect of signing any accord with an avowed enemy. The White House has promised a lobbying campaign by the president unlike any seen since he pushed through health care legislation.

Mr. Zarif and other Iranian officials may have an even harder political argument to win. They will have to overcome objections in the military and scientific establishments, especially because the accord will force them to cut the number of centrifuges enriching uranium by half, put thousands of others in storage and convert two other facilities into research sites that would have virtually no fissile material -- the makings of an atom bomb. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for civilian uses only.

Mr. Zarif seemed to sense the scope of the challenge in how he framed the agreement. He focused on the fact that Iran would not have to dismantle any facilities -- something Washington had initially demanded, especially after helping expose one such secret facility, called Fordo, in Mr. Obama's first year in office. When, late on Thursday, the White House began distributing a description of what amounted to Iranian concessions, an obviously angry Mr. Zarif challenged the American accounting in several posts on Twitter.

""There is no need to spin using 'fact sheets' so early on,"" he wrote in one, only an hour or so after.

In another, he suggested that sanctions would have to be lifted far earlier than one might think listening to Mr. Kerry, saying that, in essence, all the economic sanctions would be lifted once a final agreement was signed.

That could be another issue for the two sides, in that Washington has insisted that the sanctions be removed in a step-by-step manner as Iran fulfills its obligations under the agreement.

At another point, Mr. Zarif cautioned that no one had signed anything in Lausanne, and ""nobody has obligations now."" That would come after a final agreement.

Another problem for Mr. Zarif is that the deal he has agreed to is far more restrictive than one he outlined last July in an interview with The New York Times. At that time, he envisioned essentially keeping Iran's stockpiles and its sprawling nuclear facilities at the levels they are running under a temporary agreement struck 18 months ago. What he agreed to in Lausanne, at least according to those fact sheets, would drastically cut Iran's capability for 10 years and then allow it to build up gradually for the next five.

After that, Iran would be free to produce as much uranium as it wishes -- even building the 190,000 centrifuges that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei talked about last summer. That is bound to be a major concern for Congress, the Israelis and the Arab states, because it amounts to a bet that after 15 years, Iran will be a far more cooperative international player, perhaps under different management.

The 5,060 centrifuges is a far higher figure than the administration originally envisioned, when it argued that Iran could possess only a few hundred. But in the final negotiations, Mr. Moniz and his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, the M.I.T.-educated head of Iran's atomic energy agency, agreed that Iran would drastically cut its stockpile of nuclear fuel, from about eight tons to a little over 600 pounds. The giant underground enrichment site at Fordo, which Israeli and some American officials fear is impervious to bombing, would be partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Eventually, foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb.

But perhaps the most important compromise came in a lengthy battle over whether Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges, which are far more efficient than current models. The Iranians won the right to research, but not to use more modern machines for production for the next 10 years.

At Arak, which officials feared could produce plutonium, another pathway to a bomb, Iran agreed to redesign a heavy-water reactor in a way that would keep it from producing weapons-usable fuel.

Those conditions impressed two of the most skeptical experts on the negotiations: Gary Samore and Olli Heinonen of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and members of a group called United Against Nuclear Iran.

Mr. Samore, who was Mr. Obama's top adviser on weapons of mass destruction in his first term as president, said in an email that the deal was a ""very satisfactory resolution of Fordo and Arak issues for the 15-year term"" of the accord. He had more questions about operations at Natanz and said there was ""much detail to be negotiated, but I think it's enough to be called a political framework.""

Mr. Heinonen, the former chief inspector of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said, ""It appears to be a fairly comprehensive deal with most important parameters."" But he cautioned that ""Iran maintains enrichment capacity which will be beyond its near-term needs.""

82,82,2015-05-09-PacificTrade.txt,"Hello, Oregon!  Well, who arranged this day?   Every time I come to Oregon this is what it looks like.  Yeah!  It never rains in Oregon, does it?

All right.  Well, listen, it is wonderful to see all of you.  First of all, please give Mark another round of applause for his hospitality.  And thanks to everyone at Nike for hosting us today, here in âFederer Platz.â  You know, the White House is cool.  Weâve got a basketball court -- actually, it's a tennis court that we repainted some lines -- when I came into office.  So it's a combination basketball-tennis court.  There is a putting green that President Eisenhower put in.  Can you imagine, by the way, if I had put in a putting green?  Things have changed.   

But youâve got all that and the 18th tee box from Pebble Beach.  Come on.  Iâm sure some of my staff is running around right now in the Michael Jordan and Mia Hamm buildings -- they want to be lab rats for your new gear. 

But it is wonderful to be here.  Please give it up for two people who fight every single day for Oregon workers -- your Representatives in Congress -- they do a great job -- Earl Blumenauer and Suzanne Bonamici.  They are both here.  Give them a big round of applause.  Yay!  And there are two people who couldn't make it here today, but theyâre doing a great job and you should give them a round of applause as well, and that's Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Kurt Schrader.   

So it is great to be at the world headquarters of such an iconic company -- a company that helps athletes succeed from the individual to the world stage.  And as youâve heard, Iâve come to Oregon to talk a little bit about trade -- which initially may have had some people thinking, what, is Mariota going someplace that we didnât know about?  Heâs going to be great. Heâs an outstanding young man.  Heâs going to be terrific -- and from Hawaii, by the way.  Local boy. 

But this is important, and I want to tell you why I think trade deals and our willingness to go out there and compete on the global stage is so important.

Before I came out here, I had a chance to meet with some  small business owners from across Oregon, whose workers make everything from bikes to tea to stationery to wine.  And they know how important this is to them.  Sometimes when we talk about trade, we think of Nike, or we think of Boeing, or we think of G.E. -- we think about these big multinational companies.  But those small business leaders came here today because they understood that these markets outside the United States will help them grow, and will help them hire more folks -- just as all the suppliers to Nike or Boeing or G.E. or any of these other companies understand this is going to be critical to their growth and their ability to create new jobs.

In fact, thatâs why Ron Wyden is not here -- because heâs in Washington, D.C. as we speak quarterbacking this effort on behalf of Oregonâs small business owners and workers.

Now, small businesses are the backbone of our economy.  Eventually, like Nike, they grow sometimes into really, really big companies.  They employ millions of people; 98 percent of exporters are small businesses.  Theyâre the ones who make Made in Oregon and Made in the USA mean something.  And they represent something essential about this country -- the notion that if youâve got a good idea and youâre willing to work at it, you can turn that idea into a business, you can growth that business, and eventually, who knows what might happen.  You can give other people a chance to earn a living even as you do well.  Thatâs Americaâs promise.  And itâs up to us to keep that promise alive.

Now, that promise was threatened for almost everybody just about seven years ago, when the economy nearly collapsed, and millions of Americans lost their jobs and their homes and their life savings.  But thanks to the hard work of the American people and entrepreneurs like the ones who are here today -- and some pretty good policies from my Administration -- weâre in a different place today.  We're in a different place today.

This morning, we learned that our economy created 223,000 new jobs last month.  The unemployment rate ticked down again to 5.4 percent -- which is the lowest itâs been in almost seven years.  Thatâs 3 million new jobs over the past 12 months -- nearly the fastest pace in over a decade.  And all told, over the past 62 months in a row, Americaâs businesses have created 12.3 million new jobs.

I should add, by the way, 62 months ago is when I signed the Affordable Care Act.  So, obviously, it hasnât done too bad in terms of employment in this country.  I just thought Iâd mention that.  Since there were a lot of predictions of doom and gloom, I would just suggest those who were making those predictions go back and check the statistics.  Just saying.

So small businesses deserve a lot of credit for that.  In fact, over the past several years, small businesses have created nearly two out of every three new American jobs.  And the question is, how do we build on that success?  Weâve got to be relentless in our efforts to support small businesses who are creating jobs and helping to grow the economy.

And thatâs been the purpose behind many of the policies Iâve fought for as President.  Iâve cut taxes for small businesses more than a dozen times.  Iâve pushed for investments in infrastructure and faster Internet.  Itâs why weâve made health care more accessible, affordable, portable -- to give people the freedom to change jobs or launch that startup without worrying about losing their health insurance.

And passing trade agreements is part of that agenda if those trade agreements are the right kinds of trade agreements; if they make sure that theyâre growing our businesses, and helping American workers by selling goods Made in America across the rest of the world.

And Iâve been talking a lot about this lately, because I view smart trade agreements as a vital piece of middle-class economics.  Not a contradiction to middle-class economics, itâs a part and parcel of it.

I believe that our country does best when everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules.  And that means making sure everybody has got a good education.  It means making sure that women are getting paid the same as men for doing the same work.  It means making sure that folks have to have sick leave and family leave and that they can balance work and family in a fair way.  It means, working to increase the minimum wage all across this country -- because folks who have some of the toughest jobs oftentimes get the lowest pay.

Thatâs all part of middle-class economics, but, you know what, so is trade.  We strive to make sure our own economy lives up to high standards, but in a lot of parts of the world, the rules are unfair.  The playing field is uneven.  That puts American businesses and American workers at a disadvantage.  So the question is, what should we do about it?

Some folks think we should just withdraw and not even try to engage in trade with these countries.  I disagree.  We have to make sure America writes the rules of the global economy.  And we should do it today, while our economy is in the position of global strength.  Because if we donât write the rules for trade around the world -- guess what -- China will.  And theyâll write those rules in a way that gives Chinese workers and Chinese businesses the upper hand, and locks American-made goods out.

Thatâs the choice we face.  We're not going to be able to isolate ourselves from world markets.  We got to be in there and compete.  And the question is, are we going to make sure that the rules are fair so that our businesses and our workers are on a level playing field.  Because when they are, we win every time.  When the rules are fair, we win every time.

So this is why Iâm such a strong supporter of new trade agreements.  They're going to help our workers compete and our businesses compete.  This is not a left issue or a right issue, or a business or a labor issue.  It is about fairness and equity and access.  And like other issues that weâve waged slow, steady fights on over the last seven years, this is also a question of the past versus the future.

So the Trans-Pacific Partnership that weâre working on, itâs the biggest trade deal that we're working on right now -- has to do with the Asia Pacific region.  And it reflects our values in ways that, frankly, some previous trade agreements did not.  Itâs the highest-standard, most progressive trade deal in history.  Itâs got strong, enforceable provisions for workers, preventing things like child labor.  Itâs got strong, enforceable provisions on the environment, helping us to do things that havenât been done before, to prevent wildlife trafficking, or deforestation, or dealing with our oceans.   And these are enforceable in the agreement.

And Nike operates in the Pacific region, so they understand the competitive pressures they're under.  Nike has factories all around the world.  And letâs face it, Mark I think doesn't mind me saying it that some of these countries, they don't have the standards for wages and labor conditions that we have here.

So when you look at a country like Vietnam, under this agreement, Vietnam would actually, for the first time, have to raise its labor standards.  It would have to set a minimum wage. It would have to pass safe workplace laws to protect its workers. It would even have to protect workersâ freedom to form unions -- for the very first time.  That would make a difference.  That helps to level the playing field -- and it would be good for the workers in Vietnam, even as it helps make sure that theyâre not undercutting competition here in the United States.

So thatâs progress.  It doesnât mean that suddenly working conditions in Vietnam will be like they are here at Nike.  Or here in Portland right away.  But it moves us in the right direction.

And if Vietnam, or any of the other countries in this trade agreement donât meet these requirements, theyâll face meaningful consequences.  If youâre a country that wants in to this agreement, you have to meet higher standards.  If you donât, youâre out.  If you break the rules, there are actual repercussions.  And thatâs good for American businesses and American workers, because we already meet higher standards than most of the rest of the world, and that helps level the playing field.

And this deal would strengthen our hand overseas by giving us the tools to open other markets to our goods and services and make sure they play by the fair rules we help write.  The truth is, we have one of the most open markets in the world.  Folks are already selling stuff here.  We got to be able to sell there.  That requires us to enter into trade agreements to open up their markets.

I hear Oregon wine is actually pretty good.  Somebody told me that the pinot noir in Oregon is top-notch, right?  Iâve got some winemakers right here.  Well, I want to make sure Japanese wine consumers have the opportunity to partake -- in our excellent Oregon wine.

We got some Oregon beef producers and ranchers around here.   Beef is really expensive in Japan.  Letâs make sure they try some Oregon steaks.  Itâs good stuff.

And thatâs one of the best things that can happen for our businesses and our workers -- opening up markets that have previously been closed, particularly markets where theyâre already selling stuff here.  Thereâs a lack of reciprocity.  Itâs not a fair deal right now.  We want to make it fair.

Now, I want to acknowledge -- because this looks like a very well-read and informed crowd -- that there have been a bunch of critics about trade deals generally and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  And whatâs interesting is typically theyâre my friends, coming from my party, and theyâre my fellow travelers on minimum wage and on job training and on clean energy.  On every progressive issue, theyâre right there with me. And then on this one, theyâre like whooping on me.

But I tell you what.  Iâve run my last election, and the only reason I do something is because I think itâs good for American workers and the American people and the American economy.  I donât have any other rationale for doing what I do than I think itâs the best thing for the American people.  And on this issue, on trade, I actually think some of my dearest friends are wrong.  Theyâre just wrong.  And hereâs why.

First of all, they say that this trade agreement will cost American jobs.  And theyâre really basing this on some past experience, looking at what happened in the â90s, over the last 20 years, as there was a lot of outsourcing going on.  And you know what, past trade agreements, itâs true, didnât always reflect our values or didnât always do enough to protect American workers.  But thatâs why weâre designing a different kind of trade deal.

And the truth is that companies that only care about low wages, theyâve already moved.  They donât need new trade deals to move.  Theyâve already outsourced.  Theyâve already located in search of low wages.

What this trade agreement would do is open the doors to the higher-skill, higher-wage jobs of the future -- jobs that we excel at.  It would make sure our manufacturers who are operating at the higher end of the value chain are able to access these growing markets.  And the fact is, over the past few years, our manufacturers have been steadily creating jobs for the first time since the 1990s -- under my Administration.  After more than a decade away from the top spot, business leaders around the world have declared the United States is the worldâs number one place to invest for a third year in a row.  Third year in a row.

So the point is, outsourcing is already giving way to insourcing.  Companies are starting to move back here to do more advanced manufacturing, and this is a trend we expect to continue.  This trade deal would help that.

Just this morning, as Mark may have mentioned, Nike announced that, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it will make new investments in advanced manufacturing -- not overseas, but right here in the United States.  And far more Nike products would be made in the U.S.A.  And that means thousands of new jobs in manufacturing and engineering and design at Nike facilities across the country, and potentially tens of thousands of new jobs along Nikeâs supply chain here at home.  Thatâs what trade can do.

Look, Iâve spent six and a half years trying to rescue this economy -- six and a half years of trying to revitalize American manufacturing, including rescuing an American auto industry that was on its back and is now fully recovered.  So I would not risk any of that if I thought the trade deals were going to undermine it.  The reason Iâm for this is because I think it will enhance it and advance it.  So thatâs point number one.

Point number two -- when you ask folks specifically, what do you oppose about this trade deal, they just say âNAFTA.â  NAFTA was passed 20 years ago.  That was a different agreement.  And in fact, this agreement fixes some of what was wrong with NAFTA by making labor and environmental provisions actually enforceable.  I was just getting out of law school when NAFTA got passed.

Number three -- youâve got some critics saying that any deal would be rushed through; itâs a secret deal, people donât know whatâs in it.  This is not true.  Any agreement that we finalize with the other 11 countries will have to be posted online for at least 60 days before I even sign it.  Then it would go to Congress -- and you know theyâre not going to do anything fast.  So there will be months of review.  Every T crossed, every I dotted.  Everybody is going to be able to see exactly whatâs in it.

Thereâs nothing fast-track about this.  This is a very deliberate track -- which will be fully subject to scrutiny.  And Iâm confident when people read the agreement for themselves, theyâll see that this is the most progressive trade deal in history.

Number four -- critics warn that parts of this deal would undermine American regulation -- food safety, worker safety, even financial regulations.  Theyâre making this stuff up.  This is just not true.  No trade agreement is going to force us to change our laws.  This agreement would make sure our companies arenât discriminated against in other countries.

We already treat companies from other countries fairly here. But our companies donât always get treated fairly there.  So sometimes they need to have some way to settle disputes where itâs not subject to the whims of some government bureaucrat in that country.  Thatâs important.  We want our businesses to succeed in selling over there because that's how our workers will get more jobs here in the United States.

And then finally, some critics talk about currency manipulation.  Now, this has been a problem in the past.  Some countries, they try to lower their currency so that it makes their goods cheaper, makes our more expensive.  There was a time when China was pretty egregious about this.  When I came into office, I started pounding on them.  Every time I meet with them, Iâd be talking about currency.  And we pushed back hard, and China moved.  In real terms, their currency has appreciated about 30 percent since I came into office.  And we're going to keep on going after it.  But thatâs not an argument against this trade agreement.  If we give up the chance to help our businesses sell their stuff in the worldâs fastest-growing markets, that doesn't do anything to stop currency manipulation.

So the fact is, some folks are just opposed to trade deals out of principle, a reflexive principle.  And what I tell them is, you know what, if you're opposed to these smart, progressive trade deals, then that means you must be satisfied with the status quo.  And the status quo hasnât been working for our workers.  It hasnât been working for our businesses.  And there are people here who will tell you why.

Iâm going to just give you a couple of examples of small businesses who I had a chance to meet with today.  Egg Press is a Portland-based greeting card company.  Really nice. They sell their cards in Australia, which is a member of this Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.  Their CEO, Tess Darrow -- whereâs Tess?  Raise your hand.  I saw her.  There she is.  So Tess says that if they could more easily reach customers in Japan, as well, theyâd sell half the volume that they do here in America.  Thatâs a lot.

Right now, the logistics of exporting to Japan are too complicated.  Products end up being held up for months at the border.  This agreement would help solve some of those problems so Tess can sell more greeting cards in Japan -- presumably in Japanese.  Is there going to be -- there will be a translation process, I assume.  Yes, absolutely.  Iâm teasing.

So the trade deal would help eliminate barriers, and simplify customs, and hold countries accountable for getting products delivered swiftly.  The more Tess sells, the more she can grow, the more she can hire here in Oregon, here in the United States.

Oregon Fruit Products -- makes canned fruits, berries, other products -- depends on exports for 20 percent of its annual sales.  Right now, it exports to four members of this partnership that we're putting together:  Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Canada.  Unfortunately, selling in these countries right now can mean dealing with unfair rules designed to prevent our products from being offered in their markets.  Under this agreement, that would change.  Exporting becomes simpler, more consistent.  That means more people around the world eating Oregon berries all year long.  Berry tasty.

Sokol Blosser Winery -- we got a lot of drinkers here.  Itâs a winery, family-run in Dayton, Oregon.  One of its top export markets is Japan.  Right now, there are high tariffs on American wine in that country.  Under this trade partnership, those tariffs would be eliminated, and wineries across America could see their sales grow overseas.  The brother  --and-sister team that runs this vineyard -- wave, guys -- they say, âIf we can make it easier to do business with countries that are already our trading partners, countries that are allies, thatâs a good thing.â

Theyâre right.  This deal would be a good thing.  So letâs âjust do it.â  It took a while for you to catch that, didnât it?  I thought that was pretty obvious.

So, listen, I know a lot of folks who are skeptical about trade.  Past trade deals didnât always live up to the hype.  Labor and environmental protections werenât always strong enough. I saw for years, in Chicago and towns across Illinois, manufacturing collapsing, jobs drying up.  Outsourcing is real.  Folks didnât just make that up.  Some of our manufacturing base shifted over the last 25 years, and it wasnât good for manufacturing and it wasnât good for those communities, and it wasnât good for workers.  Thatâs the truth.  It had benefits -- other jobs were created, we got cheaper goods.  But there was real displacement and real pain.  And so, for many Americans, this is not an abstraction; this is real.

But weâve got to learn the right lessons from that.  The lesson is not that we pull up the drawbridge and build a moat around ourselves.  The lesson is, is that weâve got to make sure that the trade deals that we do shape are ones that allow us to compete fairly.

So when I took office, I decided we could rethink the way we do trade in a way that actually works for working Americans.  I didnât think this was the right thing to do just for companies.  If I didnât think this was the right thing to do for working families, I would not be fighting for it.  If any agreement undercuts working families, I wonât sign it.  I ran for office to expand opportunity for everybody -- the all-American idea that no matter who you are, or where you come from, or how you started out, or who you love, in America you can make it if you try.

So, yes, we should be mindful of the past, but we canât ignore the realities of the new economy.  We canât stand on the beaches and stop the global economy at our shores.  Weâve got to harness it on our terms.  This century is built for us.  Itâs about innovation.  Itâs about dynamism and flexibility and entrepreneurship, and information and knowledge and science and research.  Thatâs us.  So we canât be afraid of it; weâve got to seize it.  Weâve got to give every single American who wakes up, sends their kids to school, rolls up their sleeves, punches in every day the chance to do what they do best:  dream up, innovate, build, sell the best products and ideas in the world to every corner of the world.

Because, Nike, we do not just have the best athletes in the world.  We also have the best workers in the world.   We also have the best businesses in the world.  And when the playing field is level, nobody beats the United States of America.  Nobody beats the United States of America.

Just do it, everybody.  Thank you.  God bless you.

Thank you, Oregon.  Thank you.

God bless America.
","President Barack Obama used a visit to Nike Inc. Friday to defend his proposed Pacific trade agreement, but his choice of venue -- the headquarters of a huge importer -- touched off criticism from labor groups and Democratic lawmakers opposed to the deal.

Critics see Nike as a leading example of an American-based global giant built around low-wage labor in places such as Vietnam, one of the 12 countries negotiating the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.

Mr. Obama, in relaxed remarks at the company's Oregon headquarters, said binding environmental and labor rules in the deal will improve conditions in Vietnam and also avoid incentivizing further outsourcing from the U.S. He said increased trade is important in a world shaped by globalization, while avoiding new deals in the Pacific risks ceding further economic power to China, which isn't a part of the talks. ""We can't stand on the beaches and stop the global economy at our shores,"" Mr. Obama said.

Nike Inc. Chief Executive Mark Parker praised the trade agreement, which could boost the company's financials by lowering U.S. tariffs on athletic shoes made in Vietnam. The company said the trade deal could help it create thousands more jobs in the U.S. over the next decade.

But before the TPP goes live, Congress first needs to pass ""fast track"" legislation that will expedite a final up-or-down vote on the pact. Mr. Obama's trip offered political support to West Coast Democrats friendly to his trade policy. On Friday he acknowledged Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden for helping craft and support fast track, as well as Rep. Earl Blumenauer, one of just two House Democrats to vote for the bill in committee.

He omitted mention of Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Peter DeFazio, who oppose the legislation. ""The savings from tariffs from Nike and other firms would more likely go to profits than they would accrue to the lowering of prices for consumers,"" said Rep. DeFazio.

Labor unions discounted the job promises. ""We have heard similar promises from companies before, and very few have panned out,"" said Eric Hauser, communications director for the AFL-CIO, the labor federation. Other members of the U.S. footwear manufacturing industry were skeptical about Nike's statement that it could create up to 10,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in the U.S. over the next decade if the TPP is enacted.

""Whatever job gains Nike is promising, even assuming that they occur, is questionable considering the losses that would result at existing U.S. manufacturers because of the drop on tariffs,"" said Marc Fleischaker, trade counsel to the Rubber And Plastic Footwear Manufacturers Association.

Nike sells other products including apparel that could see tariff reductions under the TPP.

Boston-based New Balance, a Nike competitor, currently employs about 1,400 manufacturing employees at five factories in New England. Spokesman Matthew LeBretton acknowledged there are concerns among U.S. footwear manufacturers about how a trade pact might affect the industry, but cautioned that it is premature to discuss exactly how without knowing final terms of the legislation.

""We've had productive discussions with the Obama administration regarding TPP, and we're hopeful that the final agreement will reflect those discussions and will allow us to continue to thrive as a domestic producer,"" Mr. LeBretton said.

Business groups and many economists back the Pacific agreement, pointing toward the potential for economic growth. Mr. Blumenauer said he was ""pleased"" about Mr. Obama's trip. ""These are complex and controversial issues,"" he said.

Nike spokesman Reggie Borges said it's ""too early to say specifically where investments would be within the U.S.""
","President Obama on Friday lashed out at critics within his own party as he accused fellow Democrats of deliberately distorting the potential impact of the sweeping new trade agreement he is negotiating with Asia and standing in the way of a modern competitive economy.

With the cutting tone he usually reserves for his Republican adversaries, Mr. Obama said liberals who are fighting the new trade accord, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, were ""just wrong"" and, in terms of some of their claims, ""making this stuff up."" If they oppose the deal, he said, they ""must be satisfied with the status quo"" and want to ""pull up the drawbridge and build a moat around ourselves.""

""There have been a bunch of critics about trade deals generally and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" he told an estimated 2,100 workers at the Nike headquarters here. ""And what's interesting is typically they're my friends coming from my party. And they're my fellow travelers on minimum wage and on job training and on clean energy and on every progressive issue, they're right there with me. And then on this, they're like whupping on me.""

But Mr. Obama said that he had no political motive for supporting freer trade with Asia. ""I've run my last election,"" he said. ""And the only reason I do something is because I think it's good for American workers and the American people and the American economy."" And so, ""on this issue, on trade, I actually think some of my dearest friends are wrong. They're just wrong.""

The president's speech here on the sprawling campus of the sports apparel company represented his most expansive defense of his trade agenda since asking Congress to grant him negotiating power often called fast-track authority. His forceful words underscored the crossfire among Democrats over trade and the enormous challenge he faces in rallying his party behind one of the most significant initiatives left in his presidency.

The presidential trip here to trade-friendly Oregon was part of an unusually concerted White House drive to press Democrats to fall in line. Mr. Obama hoped to capitalize on an announcement by Nike that the company and its partners would create up to 10,000 new jobs in the United States if the Pacific trade pact was approved. He later flew to Watertown, S.D., to give the commencement address at a technical institute to highlight his proposal for free community college to train workers for the modern economy.

But the president has yet to convince many allies, and his sharp criticism seemed aimed partly at Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat leading the fight against the trade deal, although he did not cite her by name. His remarks may only further provoke Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the minority leader who was already said to be so annoyed by Mr. Obama's language lately that he was motivated to make a more robust effort to block trade negotiating authority.

Other Democrats on Friday bristled at the notion that they were wrong or distorting facts. ""It may be a freebie, a throwaway line that denigrates members of Congress,"" Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview. ""Well, presidents can do that. But the bulk of the information buttresses everything that we have been saying and that's the ground on which we stand.""

Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York, said experience with North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, and subsequent trade deals bolstered their concerns. ""I don't know why he would say that,"" she said. ""We'll all forgive him, of course. But it's absolutely inaccurate. We know exactly what we're talking about. My concern is that he does not understand what's in it.""

She needled the president for becoming such a full-throated advocate of trade after having sided with its critics during his first run for the presidency. ""This is the same Barack Obama who ran in 2008 wanting to renegotiate Nafta that was so bad?"" Ms. Slaughter asked. ""Is this the same guy?""

The clash underscored the president's remove from his own party on this issue and echoed similar difficulties other presidents have had with allies late in their terms. In May 2007, at the same point in his presidency down to the month, George W. Bush gave a speech that was strikingly similar in its tone and frustration in which he condemned fellow Republicans opposing his efforts to overhaul the immigration system. In the end, Mr. Bush's alliance with the opposition Democrats collapsed.

Mr. Bush was significantly weaker with Republicans than Mr. Obama is with Democrats, according to polls, but the similarity suggests the cycle of history in which presidents at this stage are more willing to challenge their party orthodoxy even as their party feels freer to abandon them on points of ideology, principle and political calculation. Even Hillary Rodham Clinton, who as secretary of state was part of the administration when trade negotiations began, is now hedging support as she runs for the presidency.

Nike was a risky choice for Mr. Obama to make his case for trade. For years, the multibillion-dollar company has been cited as a case study by opponents of trade liberalization for its reliance on low-wage workers in Asia. But Mr. Obama hoped that the company's announcement would help him argue that a new trade agreement could foster more manufacturing jobs at home, rather than shipping more jobs overseas.

""Free trade opens doors. It removes barriers. It creates jobs. It lets us invest more in the things that matter -- that's innovation, that's creativity and people,"" Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, told the crowd before Mr. Obama's speech.

Nike employs about 26,000 people in America, but its contract factories overseas employ about one million people, roughly a third of them in Vietnam. The firm said tariff relief would allow the company to speed development of advanced manufacturing methods and a domestic supply chain. In addition to 10,000 new manufacturing and engineering jobs, the company predicted that the trade pact would create up to 40,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and service companies over 10 years.

Mr. Obama acknowledged that Nafta and other trade deals ""didn't always live up to the hype,"" but he promised greater labor and environmental protections in the new Pacific accord and said it would fix some of the problems of older agreements, in effect fulfilling that 2008 campaign promise Ms. Slaughter recalled.

""When you ask folks specifically, 'What do you oppose about this trade deal?' they just say, 'Nafta,' "" Mr. Obama said. ""Nafta was passed 20 years ago. That was a different agreement. And in fact this agreement fixes some of what was wrong with Nafta by making labor and environmental provisions actually enforceable. I was just getting out of law school when Nafta got passed.""

Mr. Obama insisted that ""this is the most progressive trade deal in history"" and he scorned critics who say it would undermine American laws and regulations on food safety, worker rights and even financial regulations, an implicit pushback against Ms. Warren. ""They're making this stuff up,"" he said. ""This is just not true. No trade agreement's going to force us to change our laws.""

""The fact is,"" he added, ""some folks are just opposed to trade deals out of principle, a reflexive principle. And what I tell them is, 'You know what? If you're opposed to these smart, progressive trade deals, then that means you must be satisfied with the status quo.' ""

83,83,2015-06-18-CharlestonShooting.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody.  This morning, I spoke with, and Vice President Biden spoke with, Mayor Joe Riley and other leaders of Charleston to express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders that took place last night.

Michelle and I know several members of Emanuel AME Church.  We knew their pastor, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who, along with eight others, gathered in prayer and fellowship and was murdered last night.  And to say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families, and their community doesnât say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel.  

Any death of this sort is a tragedy.  Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy.  There is something particularly heartbreaking about the death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship.  

Mother Emanuel is, in fact, more than a church.  This is a place of worship that was founded by African Americans seeking liberty.  This is a church that was burned to the ground because its worships -- worshipers worked to end slavery.  When there were laws banning all-black church gatherings, they conducted services in secret.  When there was a nonviolent movement to bring our country closer in line with our highest ideals, some of our brightest leaders spoke and led marches from this churchâs steps.  This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America.

The FBI is now on the scene with local police, and more of the Bureauâs best are on the way to join them.  The Attorney General has announced plans for the FBI to open a hate crime investigation.  We understand that the suspect is in custody.  And Iâll let the best of law enforcement do its work to make sure that justice is served.

Until the investigation is complete, Iâm necessarily constrained in terms of talking about the details of the case.  But I donât need to be constrained about the emotions that tragedies like this raise.  Iâve had to make statements like this too many times.  Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times.  We donât have all the facts, but we do know that, once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun.  Now is the time for mourning and for healing.  

But letâs be clear:  At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.  It doesnât happen in other places with this kind of frequency.  And it is in our power to do something about it.  I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now.  But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it.  And at some point itâs going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it, and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively.

The fact that this took place in a black church obviously also raises questions about a dark part of our history.  This is not the first time that black churches have been attacked.  And we know that hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals.

The good news is I am confident that the outpouring of unity and strength and fellowship and love across Charleston today, from all races, from all faiths, from all places of worship indicates the degree to which those old vestiges of hatred can be overcome.  That, certainly, was Dr. Kingâs hope just over 50 years ago, after four little girls were killed in a bombing in a black church in Birmingham, Alabama.  

He said they lived meaningful lives, and they died nobly.  âThey say to each of us,â Dr. King said:

    ...black and white alike, that we must substitute courage for caution.  They say to us that we must be concerned not merely with [about] who murdered them, but about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderers.  Their death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American Dream.1

    And if one will hold on, he will discover that God walks with him, and that God is able to lift you from the fatigue of despair to the buoyancy of hope, and transform dark and desolate valleys into sunlit paths of inner peace.2

Reverend Pinckney and his congregation understood that spirit.  Their Christian faith compelled them to reach out not just to members of their congregation, or to members of their own communities, but to all in need.  They opened their doors to strangers who might enter a church in search of healing or redemption.  

Mother Emanuel church and its congregation have risen before -- from flames, from an earthquake, from other dark times -- to give hope to generations of Charlestonians.  And with our prayers and our love, and the buoyancy of hope, it will rise again now as a place of peace.

Thank you.
","About a month ago, Dylann Roof's family became concerned. The once-quiet, bright boy from a middle-class family had been drifting and began to tell relatives he was involved in racist groups.

""He turned into a loner in the last couple of years and no one knew why,"" said a woman reached at the house of his former stepmother.

On Wednesday night, police said, the 21-year-old Mr. Roof entered an African-American church here that dates to the time of slavery, sat quietly through an hour or so of Bible study, then pulled out a pistol and methodically killed nine people.

Thursday morning, after a massive manhunt, police in Shelby, N.C., some 240 miles to the northwest, apprehended Mr. Roof after a traffic stop. Authorities had received a tip from a motorist who reported seeing a person in a nearby car who resembled a man in surveillance video from the shooting scene that had been posted online. The car carried a Confederate-flag novelty license plate.

Among those gunned down inside Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the nation's most historic black houses of worship, was its leader, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a long-serving South Carolina state senator and civil rights leader.

The other victims, who ranged in age from 26 to 87, included three other religious leaders at the church. One was a high school track coach, another was an up-and-coming minister and the third was a 74-year-old pastor.

Mr. Roof told his horrified victims that African-Americans were ""raping our women"" and purposely left one person alive to share his motivations, according to a person familiar with the investigation.

President Barack Obama said Thursday that ""this is not the first time that black churches have been attacked. And we know that hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals.""

The violence came at a time of heightened racial sensitivity after the shootings of African-American suspects in disputed incidents by police -- including one a few miles away in neighboring North Charleston, where a cellphone video in April captured an officer shooting to death an unarmed man, Walter Scott, in the back as he was running away.

Local authorities called the church shooting a hate crime, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation launched its own investigation, which could ultimately lead to federal prosecution.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that while the Justice Department was investigating the case as a hate crime, it was too soon to say whether state or federal authorities would prosecute Mr. Roof on such charges.

Mr. Pinckney, 41, was a married father of two daughters who began serving in the South Carolina Legislature in 1997. He had recently played a key role in helping pass legislation to provide body cameras for all South Carolina police officers in the aftermath of the Walter Scott shooting, lawmakers said.

Bakari Sellers, a former Democratic state representative and friend of Mr. Pinckney, said Mr. Pinckney's family has been informed by authorities that Mr. Roof had been given a pistol for his 21st birthday, and that he was driving a car with a Confederate flag vanity plate.

Mr. Roof repeated ninth grade in Lexington, S.C., and left school in February 2010, a spokeswoman for Lexington County School District One said. A month later, Mr. Roof enrolled as a ninth-grade student at Dreher High School in Columbia, S.C., according to Richland County School District One. He attended through May of 2010 but didn't return, a district official said.

The woman who said Mr. Roof had begun to express racist views described him as a bright child who stopped applying himself at school. The woman said Mr. Roof's ex-stepmother is her daughter.

Mr. Roof's last known address was in Eastover, S.C., a rural community about 15 miles southeast of Columbia, the state capital. The property has two houses, and people at both declined to comment.

Mr. Roof had lived off and on with his father, Ben Roof, in Columbia, a family friend said. He described the father as a hardworking, friendly, churchgoing man who had recently expressed concerns about his son's lack of direction.

The friend described the suspect as a lanky young man who was a loner who rarely smiled. ""You could see that he was troubled,"" he said.

The elder Mr. Roof has a racially diverse set of friends, and wouldn't have taught his son racial intolerance, the friend said. ""There are African-Americans over at that home all the time,"" the friend said.

The elder Mr. Roof couldn't be reached for comment.

The woman reached at Dylann Roof's ex-stepmother's house added that the young man ""just fell off the grid somehow.""

Mr. Roof was acting suspiciously in the months before the shooting, according to a police report. On Feb. 28, he was arrested for drug possession at a Columbia mall, where the report said he was wearing all black and rattling employees at two stores with unusual questions about staffing and operating hours.

In the incident report, the arresting officer said Mr. Roof was nervous and said his parents were pressuring him to get a job, though he acknowledged he hadn't asked for an application from the stores.

Mr. Roof was released two days later from the Lexington County Detention Center on a $5,000 personal recognizance bond, said Maj. John Allard, a spokesman for the county sheriff.

Mr. Roof was banned from the mall for a year but was arrested in its parking lot on April 26, when he was charged with trespassing, another police report said. His car was turned over to his mother, and he was placed on a new three-year ban, the police record said.

Mr. Roof's grandfather, Columbia lawyer C. Joseph Roof, declined to speak at length about his grandson, but said, ""I can tell you that I love him.""

A photo of Mr. Roof on what appears to be his Facebook page shows him wearing patches representing South Africa's apartheid-era government and the former white-ruled country Rhodesia.

In both police reports Mr. Roof gave his middle name as Storm, which is popular among white supremacists and could derive from stormfront.org, a website frequented by so-called white racialists, according to a person familiar with such groups.
","The mass murder of nine people who gathered Wednesday night for Bible study at a landmark black church has shaken a city whose history from slavery to the Civil War to the present is inseparable from the nation's anguished struggle with race.

Fourteen hours after the massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, in which the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the church pastor and a prominent state senator, was among the dead, the police in Shelby, N.C., acting on a tip from a motorist, on Thursday arrested Dylann Storm Roof, a 21-year-old white man with an unsettled personal life and a recent history of anti-black views.

The killings, with victims ranging in age from 26 to 87, left people stunned and grieving. Witnesses said Mr. Roof sat with church members for an hour and then started venting against African-Americans and opened fire on the group.

At Morris Brown A.M.E. Church here, blacks, whites, Christians and Jews gathered to proclaim that a racist gunman would not divide a community already tested by the fatal police shooting in April of an unarmed African-American, Walter Scott.

""We cannot make sense of what has happened, but we can come together,"" declared the Rev. George Felder Jr., pastor of New Hope A.M.E. Church.

Gov. Nikki R. Haley fought back tears, her voice trembling and cracking, at a news conference here. ""We woke up today, and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken,"" she said. ""Parents are having to explain to their kids how they can go to church and feel safe, and that is not something we ever thought we'd deal with.""

President Obama, once again having to confront the nation's divisions, saw systemic issues of guns, violence and race in the tragedy in Charleston.

""We don't have all the facts, but we do know that, once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun,"" he said at the White House.

And quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. after four black girls were killed in the bombing of a black church in Birmingham, Ala., 52 years ago, he said the lessons of this tragedy must extend beyond one city and one church. He cited Dr. King's words that their deaths were a demand to ""substitute courage for caution,"" and urging people to ask not just who did the killing but ""about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderers.""

Even amid calls here for calm and compassion, at least three bomb threats were made Thursday that forced the evacuation of buildings around Charleston, including churches where prayer vigils were being held for the shooting victims. And while the racially mixed crowds inside those churches linked arms and appealed for harmony, the tone among some black people gathered on the city's streets was not so conciliatory.

Jareem Brady, 42, said the shooting was only an extension of what black people face daily. ""We're not worth the air they don't want us to breathe,"" he said of Charleston's white citizens.

The church holds a special place in the history of Charleston and particularly of its African-American population. It has the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, according to the National Park Service, and its website calls it the oldest A.M.E. church in the South. The church's current Gothic Revival building was completed in 1891, but the congregation dates to before 1820.

Of those killed, the most prominent was the church's leader, Mr. Pinckney, 41.

""He was very gentle,"" Mayor Joseph P. Riley said. ""He spoke thoughtfully and deliberately. He had a big job, because that's a big, important church.""

Mr. Pinckney was holding a Bible study session with a small group on Wednesday when, surveillance video shows, the suspect arrived after 8 p.m. -- a slight, blond man with a bowl haircut and a gray sweatshirt. He sat down with the others for a while and listened, then began to disagree with others as they spoke about Scripture, said Kristen Washington, who heard the harrowing story from her family members who were at the meeting and survived.

Witnesses to the killings said the gunman asked for the pastor when he entered the church, and sat next to Mr. Pinckney during the Bible study.

They said that almost an hour after he arrived, the gunman suddenly stood and pulled a gun, and Ms. Washington's cousin Tywanza Sanders, 26, known as the peacemaker of the family, tried to calmly talk the man out of violence.

""You don't have to do this,"" he told the gunman, Ms. Washington recounted.

The gunman replied, ""Yes. You are raping our women and taking over the country.""

The gunman took aim at the oldest person present, Susie Jackson, 87, Mr. Sanders's aunt, Ms. Washington said. Mr. Sanders told the man to point the gun at him instead, she said, but the man said, ""It doesn't matter. I'm going to shoot all of you.""

Mr. Sanders dived in front of his aunt and the first shot struck him, Ms. Washington said, and then the gunman began shooting others. She said Mr. Sanders's mother, Felicia, and his niece, lay motionless on the floor, playing dead, and were not shot.

The gunman looked at one woman and told her ""that she was going to live so that she can tell the story of what happened,"" said City Councilman William Dudley Gregorie, a friend of the woman and a trustee of the church.

""She is still in shock, the carnage was just unbelievable is my understanding,"" he said. ""One of the younger kids in the church literally had to play dead, and it's my understanding that my friend might have also laid down on top of him to protect him as well.""

The gunman left six women and three men dead or dying, including a library manager, a former county administrator, a speech therapist who also worked for the church, and two ministers. Greg Mullen, the Charleston police chief, called it a hate crime, and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said the Justice Department was investigating that possibility.

In a photo on his Facebook page, a glowering Mr. Roof wears symbols of two former white supremacist governments -- the flags of apartheid-era South Africa, and of Rhodesia, the nation that became Zimbabwe. Other photos, posted by a Facebook friend of his and widely circulated online, show Mr. Roof leaning against a car with a license plate that reads, Confederate States of America.

The tragedy had a particular resonance in a city that offers perhaps the sharpest contrast in the South between its cosmopolitan, tolerant present and its antebellum past, when Charleston was the capital of the slave trade. It was in Charleston that a state convention adopted the ""ordinance of secession"" in December 1860, putting South Carolina on a path to become the first state to leave the Union, and the first shots of the Civil War were fired four months later at Fort Sumter.

The shooting reignited demands that the South Carolina Legislature end its practice of flying the Confederate battle flag on the grounds of the state Capitol in Columbia.

But if the church shooting prompted comparisons to the 1963 bombing of a black church in Birmingham by white supremacists that killed four girls, it also illustrated how much has changed. The earlier bombing took place as black people struggled to secure basic civil rights, at a time when many were barred from voting, much less holding office. Alabama's governor at the time, George C. Wallace, was the public face of white resistance, and no one was charged with the crime until 12 years later.

The shooting Wednesday took the life of a black state legislator, an arrest was made in hours, and some of the most emotional expressions of mourning came from Ms. Haley, whose parents are from India and who is the state's first female governor and the first not of European descent.

Local, state and federal law enforcement officials started a manhunt for the suspect, distributing pictures of him entering the church, and asking people to be on the lookout for him or his 2000 Hyundai sedan. By midmorning Thursday, he had been identified as Mr. Roof, described as 5-foot-9 and weighing 120 pounds.

The police said it was a tip from a commuter that led to the arrest.

Deborah Dills was traveling along Highway 74 on Thursday morning from her home in Gastonia, N.C., to her part-time job at a florist in Kings Mountain, N.C., when she spotted a dark Hyundai Elantra with South Carolina plates. The car -- and its driver, Ms. Dills, 51, soon thought -- matched the descriptions in the police alert she had heard on the morning news.

""I thought oh no, Debbie, you're just paranoid, you've had this on your mind so strong. This is not happening here. What would he be doing here?"" Ms. Dills said in an interview.

Unsure of what to do, she called Todd Frady, the owner of the florist shop.

""She got kind of nervous and pulled off,"" Mr. Frady said. He insisted she follow the car, while he called the Kings Mountain police.

Ms. Dills rushed back onto the highway, lined with stores and fast-food restaurants in a chain of suburbs west of Charlotte, in pursuit of the Hyundai. Finally at a stoplight near a Walmart in Shelby, N.C., she pulled up behind the car and read its license plate number to Mr. Frady, who relayed it to the police.

""That's it,"" he told her. ""That's him.""

A short time later, at 10:43 a.m., the police in Shelby, 250 miles north of Charleston, pulled over the Hyundai and arrested Mr. Roof. He waived extradition and was flown to South Carolina on Thursday evening and, amid extraordinary security, walked into the jail in Charleston County at 7:25 p.m.

As Mr. Roof, who was wearing a striped jail jumpsuit, entered the jail through a secured entrance, a police dog barked, cameras clicked and one woman muttered, ""The bastard's here.""

Nearby, a 15-year-old boy from North Charleston held a handwritten sign: ""Your evil doing did not break our community! You made us stronger!""

The boy, Hikaym Rivers, said that he doubted Mr. Roof saw his message -- and he questioned whether the suspect would have cared if he noticed the sign -- but he said it was important to make a public statement one night after the shooting in Charleston.

""We're supporting our community, and we're taking a stand that no one can just take this away from us,"" he said. ""It's our peace of mind.""

Jail officials said that Mr. Roof would make a court appearance on Friday afternoon.

In Charleston, nicknamed the Holy City for its large number of churches, many houses of worship held prayer vigils, for the dead and for survivors, that drew people from different communities, races and denominations together.

At Morris Brown A.M.E. Church, just a few blocks from Emanuel, the mood of a packed house alternated between grief, hope and resilience. Calls of ""enough is enough"" echoed as the Rev. John Richard Bryant called for an end to gun violence.

""You look like a quilt, you look like patches,"" Mr. Bryant said. ""You all fit somewhere.""

Hundreds of people packed the pews of the white-columned Second Presbyterian Church on Thursday evening in a vigil to remember the victims of the shooting. Pastors read Scripture, the congregation sang and the Rev. Sidney Davis delivered a rousing sermon, his voice cracking at times. After reading a passage from the Bible, he said, ""Last night, Satan came again. Satan came to say white and black cannot raise God.""

Later, he told the racially mixed congregation that the bullets were not simply penetrating the people who died in the church. ""It was all of us dying last night,"" he said.

84,84,2015-07-07-ISILPolicy.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody.  I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday weekend -- especially our men and women in uniform.  This Fourth of July we were honored to once again welcome some of our incredible troops and their families to share Fourth of July and fireworks at the White House.  It was another chance for us, on behalf of the American people, to express our gratitude for their extraordinary service around the world every day.

And that includes the work that brings me here today -- our mission to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group ISIL.  This is a cause, a coalition, thatâs united countries across the globe -- some 60 nations, including Arab partners.  Our comprehensive strategy against ISIL is harnessing all elements of American power, across our government -- military, intelligence, diplomatic, economic, development and perhaps most importantly, the power of our values.

Last month, I ordered additional actions in support of our strategy.  I just met with my national security team as part of our regular effort to assess our efforts -- whatâs working and what we can do better.  Secretary Carter, Chairman Dempsey, I want to thank you and your team for welcoming us and for your leadership, including General Austin whoâs leading the military campaign.  And I want to summarize briefly where we stand.

I want to start by repeating what Iâve said since the beginning.  This will not be quick.  This is a long-term campaign.  ISIL is opportunistic and it is nimble.  In many places in Syria and Iraq, including urban areas, itâs dug in among innocent civilian populations.  It will take time to root them out -- and doing so must be the job of local forces on the ground, with training and air support from our coalition.

As with any military effort, there will be periods of progress, but there are also going to be some setbacks -- as weâve seen with ISILâs gains in Ramadi in Iraq and central and southern Syria.  But today, itâs also important for us to recognize the progress that's been made.

Our coalition has now hit ISIL with more than 5,000 airstrikes.  Weâve taken out thousands of fighting positions, tanks, vehicles, bomb factories, and training camps.  Weâve eliminated thousands of fighters, including senior ISIL commanders.  And over the past year, weâve seen that when we have an effective partner on the ground, ISIL can be pushed back.

In Iraq, ISIL lost at the Mosul Dam.  ISIL lost at Mount Sinjar.  ISIL has lost repeatedly across Kirkuk Province.  ISIL lost at Tikrit.  Altogether, ISIL has lost more than a quarter of the populated areas that it had seized in Iraq.  In Syria, ISIL lost at Kobani.  Itâs recently endured losses across northern Syria, including the key city of Tal Abyad, denying ISIL a vital supply route to Raqqa, its base of operations in Syria.

So these are reminders that ISILâs strategic weaknesses are real.  ISIL is surrounded by countries and communities committed to its destruction.  It has no air force; our coalition owns the skies.  ISIL is backed by no nation.  It relies on fear, sometimes executing its own disillusioned fighters.  Its unrestrained brutality often alienates those under its rule, creating new enemies.  In short, ISILâs recent losses in both Syria and Iraq prove that ISIL can and will be defeated.

Indeed, weâre intensifying our efforts against ISILâs base in Syria.  Our airstrikes will continue to target the oil and gas facilities that fund so much of their operations.  Weâre going after the ISIL leadership and infrastructure in Syria -- the heart of ISIL that pumps funds and propaganda to people around the world.  Partnering with other countries -- sharing more information, strengthening laws and border security -- allows us to work to stem the flow of foreign fighters to Syria as well as Iraq, and to stem, obviously, the flow of those fighters back into our own countries.  This continues to be a challenge, and, working together, all our nations are going to need to do more, but we're starting to see some progress.

Weâll continue cracking down on ISILâs illicit finance around the world.  By the way, if Congress really wants to help in this effort, they can confirm Mr. Adam Szubin, our nominee for Treasury Under Secretary to lead this effort.  This is a vital position to our counterterrorism efforts.  Nobody suggests Mr. Szubin is not qualified.  Heâs highly qualified.  Unfortunately, his nomination has been languishing up on the Hill, and we need the Senate to confirm him as soon as possible.

Meanwhile, we continue to ramp up our training and support of local forces that are fighting ISIL on the ground.  As Iâve said before, this aspect of our strategy was moving too slowly.  But the fall of Ramadi has galvanized the Iraqi government.  So, with the additional steps I ordered last month, weâre speeding up training of ISIL [Iraqi] forces, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar Province.

More Sunni volunteers are coming forward.  Some are already being trained, and they can be a new force against ISIL.  We continue to accelerate the delivery of critical equipment, including anti-tank weapons, to Iraqi security forces, including the Peshmerga and tribal fighters.  And I made it clear to my team that we will do more to train and equip the moderate opposition in Syria.

Now, all this said, our strategy recognizes that no amount of military force will end the terror that is ISIL unless itâs matched by a broader effort -- political and economic -- that addresses the underlying conditions that have allowed ISIL to gain traction.  They have filled a void, and we have to make sure that as we push them out that void is filled.  So, as Iraqi cities and towns are liberated from ISIL, weâre working with Iraq and the United Nations to help communities rebuild the security, services and governance that they need.  We continue to support the efforts of Prime Minister Abadi to forge an inclusive and effective Iraqi government that unites all the people of Iraq -- Shia, Sunnis, Kurds and all minority communities.

In Syria, the only way that the civil war will end -- and in a way so that the Syrian people can unite against ISIL -- is an inclusive political transition to a new government, without Bashar Assad -- a government that serves all Syrians.  I discussed this with our Gulf Cooperation Council partners at Camp David and during my recent call with President Putin.  I made it clear the United States will continue to work for such a transition.

And a glimmer of good news is I think an increasing recognition on the part of all the players in the region that given the extraordinary threat that ISIL poses it is important for us to work together, as opposed to at cross-purposes, to make sure that an inclusive Syrian government exists.

While the focus of our discussions today was on Iraq and Syria, ISIL and its ideology also obviously pose a grave threat beyond the region.  In recent weeks weâve seen deadly attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and Egyptâs Sinai Peninsula.  We see a growing ISIL presence in Libya and attempts to establish footholds across North Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Southeast Asia. Weâve seen attacks in Ottawa, Sydney, France and Copenhagen.

So Iâve called on the international community to unite against this scourge of violent extremism.  In this fight, the United States continues to lead.  When necessary to prevent attacks against our nation, weâll take direct action against terrorists.  Weâll continue to also partner with nations from Afghanistan to Nigeria to build up their security forces.  Weâre going to work day and night with allies and partners to disrupt terrorist networks and thwart attacks, and to smother nascent ISIL cells that may be trying to develop in other parts of the world.

This also includes remaining vigilant in protecting against attacks here in the homeland.  Now, I think it's important for us to recognize the threat of violent extremism is not restricted to any one community.  Here in the United States, weâve seen all kinds of homegrown terrorism.  And tragically, recent history reminds us how even a single individual motivated by a hateful ideology with access to dangerous weapons can inflict horrendous harm on Americans.  So our efforts to counter violent extremism must not target any one community because of their faith or background, including patriotic Muslim Americans who are our partners in keeping our country safe.

That said, we also have to acknowledge that ISIL has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world, including here in the United States.  And they are targeting Muslim communities around the world.  Numerous individuals have been arrested across the country for plotting attacks or attempting to join ISIL in Syria and Iraq.  Two men apparently inspired by ISIL opened fire in Garland, Texas.  And because of our success over the years in improving our homeland security, weâve made it harder for terrorists to carry out large-scale attacks like 9/11 here at home.

But the threat of lone wolves or small cells of terrorists is complex -- it's harder to detect and harder to prevent.  Itâs one of the most difficult challenges that we face.  And preventing these kinds of attacks on American soil is going to require sustained effort.

So I just want to repeat, the good news is that because of extraordinary efforts from law enforcement as well as our military intelligence, we are doing a better job at preventing any large-scale attacks on the homeland.  On the other hand, the small, individual lone wolf attacks or small cells become harder to detect and they become more sophisticated, using new technologies.  And that means that we're going to have to pick up our game to prevent these attacks.

It's also true why, ultimately, in order for us to defeat terrorist groups like ISIL and al Qaeda it's going to also require us to discredit their ideology -- the twisted thinking that draws vulnerable people into their ranks.  As Iâve said before -- and I know our military leaders agree -- this broader challenge of countering violent extremism is not simply a military effort.  Ideologies are not defeated with guns; theyâre defeated by better ideas -- a more attractive and more compelling vision.

So the United States will continue to do our part, by working with partners to counter ISILâs hateful propaganda, especially online.  Weâll constantly reaffirm through words and deeds that we will never be at war with Islam.  Weâre fighting terrorists who distort Islam and whose victims are mostly Muslims.  But around the world, weâre also going to insist on partnering with Muslim communities as they seek security, prosperity and the dignity that they deserve.  And we're going to expect those communities to step up in terms of pushing back as hard as they can, in conjunction with other people of goodwill, against these hateful ideologies in order to discredit them more effectively, particularly when it comes to what we're teaching young people.

And this larger battle for hearts and minds is going to be a generational struggle.  It's ultimately not going to be won or lost by the United States alone.  It will be decided by the countries and the communities that terrorists like ISIL target.  Itâs going to be up to Muslim communities, including scholars and clerics, to keep rejecting warped interpretations of Islam, and to protect their sons and daughters from recruitment.  It will be up to all people -- leaders and citizens -- to reject the sectarianism that so often fuels the resentments and conflicts upon which terrorists are currently thriving.  It will be up to governments to address the political and economic grievances that terrorists exploit.

Nations that empower citizens to decide their own destiny, that uphold human rights for all their people, that invest in education and create opportunities for their young people -- those can be powerful antidotes to extremist ideologies.  Those are the countries that will find a true partner in the United States.

In closing, let me note that this Fourth of July we celebrated 239 years of American independence.  Across more than two centuries, weâve faced much bigger, much more formidable challenges than this -- Civil War, a Great Depression, fascism, communism, terrible natural disasters, 9/11.  And every time, every generation, our nation has risen to the moment.  We donât simply endure; we emerge stronger than before.  And that will be the case here.

Our mission to destroy ISIL and to keep our country safe will be difficult.  It will take time.  There will be setbacks as well as progress.  But as President and Commander-in-Chief, I want to say to all our men and women in uniform who are serving in this operation -- our pilots, the crews on the ground, our personnel not only on the ground but at sea, our intelligence teams and our diplomatic teams -- I want to thank you.  We are proud of you, and you have my total confidence that youâre going to succeed.

To the American people, I want to say we will continue to be vigilant.  We will persevere.  And just as we have for more than two centuries, we will ultimately prevail.

Thank you very much, everybody.  And thanks to the team up on the stage here with me -- theyâre doing an outstanding job.
","The White House is crafting a Middle East strategy for the remaining 18 months of President Barack Obama's term that would more forcefully address conflicts in Iraq, Yemen and Syria amid tensions over the conclusion of talks with Iran.

U.S. and Iranian negotiators narrowed some key differences for completing a deal that would scale back Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. The talks face a Tuesday diplomatic deadline, but the two sides remained at odds on Monday over several critical elements.

Any reorientation of Mr. Obama's Middle East strategy would test the durability of his broader foreign-policy doctrine, and senior administration officials said the president is intent on cleaning up leftover messes in the region before leaving office in 2017, including relations with key allies that have been strained by the Iran talks.

White House officials see the conclusion of Iran talks as a gateway for Mr. Obama to press for a political resolution in Syria that would facilitate the exit of President Bashar al-Assad, a close Iranian ally.

""It's something I'd expect to see more pickup on as the Iran talks conclude,"" a senior administration official said. ""There's a growing sense that momentum has turned against Assad and that is feeding a belief that there could be more opening on the political track.""

The conclusion of talks would thrust the U.S. into unfamiliar territory in a volatile region where years of diplomacy with Tehran has left relations with America's allies, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, deeply strained.

Those alliances could be further frayed if the U.S. takes steps toward a broader rapprochement with Iran, and U.S. officials face a significant task in smoothing regional strains.

Any effort to work with Iran in the fight against Islamic State extremists, for example, likely would generate further anxiety among Iran's neighbors. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have pushed hard to keep Iran out of the alliance patched together to fight the militant group in Syria and Iraq, accusing Tehran of propping up the Assad regime.

White House officials said the Middle East approach would include an expansive U.S. effort to keep ties with Persian Gulf states from fraying further.

Mr. Obama met with officials from members of the Gulf Cooperation Council in May and pledged new military and security measures. The U.S. has designated a team to see through the pledges.

The Obama administration is also determining how Washington might engage Tehran on issues beyond its nuclear program.

Until now, Iran has shown little willingness to seriously address other regional issues, U.S. officials said. But Iranian officials have begun to suggest, in public and private talks with their American counterparts, possible engagement on other issues after the conclusion of nuclear talks.

""We are ready to strike a balanced and good deal and open new horizons to address important common challenges,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Friday in a message posted on YouTube, calling extremist violence ""our common threat today.""

Mr. Obama's critics say he has been too willing to let other crises fester in an attempt to achieve his overarching goal of reining in Iran's nuclear program. His 2013 decision to pull back on launching airstrikes in Syria after concluding Mr. Assad had used chemical weapons fueled criticism of his Middle East strategy.

The president's aides say his approach has been necessary, given the significant threat a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to the region and the U.S.

U.S. officials are unsure how a nuclear deal would affect Tehran's behavior. Iran could firm its support for Mr. Assad or cut a deal to push him aside, U.S. officials said.

""They'll have more money to be bad actors if they choose to be bad actors,"" another senior administration official said. ""But they'll also have more opportunities to be constructive if they choose that route.""

Russia would be a critical component of any U.S. effort on Syria. U.S.-Russia relations have soured over Moscow's intervention in Ukraine, but Russian President Vladimir Putin raised hopes in the White House when he initiated a June 25 phone call with Mr. Obama to discuss Syria.

Mr. Obama, in remarks Monday at the Pentagon, said the only way to end Syria's civil war is for Mr. Assad to exit, a point he said that he stressed to Arab leaders and Mr. Putin during their phone call.

""And a glimmer of good news is, I think, an increasing recognition on the part of all the players in the region that, given the extraordinary threat that ISIL poses, it is important for us to work together as opposed to at cross-purposes to make sure that an inclusive Syrian government exists,"" Mr. Obama said, using another acronym for Islamic State.

Even if a nuclear deal is clinched, defense officials said the Obama administration would have to think twice about pushing more aggressively for the removal of Mr. Assad if doing so would antagonize Tehran.
","Seven weeks after their frenetic retreat from Ramadi, Iraqi security forces are preparing to mount a counteroffensive in the coming weeks to try to reclaim the pivotal western Iraqi city from the Islamic State, American and Iraqi officials say.

Since the Islamic State seized Ramadi in May, about 2,000 militant fighters have been building up defenses -- including rigging empty buildings with explosives.

Struggling to regain the momentum in its campaign to ""degrade"" and ultimately defeat the Islamic State, the militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL, the Obama administration wants the Iraqis to retake the city before the militants dig in even more.

At the Pentagon on Monday, President Obama said the fall of Ramadi was a setback that had ""galvanized"" the Iraqi government and accelerated an American effort that had been ""moving too slowly"" to better train and equip Iraqi forces, including Sunni fighters.

""This will not be quick -- this is a long-term campaign,"" Mr. Obama said of the fight against the militant group after meeting for just under two hours with top military commanders to get an overview of the offensive. ""ISIL is opportunistic, and it is nimble. In many places in Syria and Iraq, including urban areas, it's dug in among innocent civilian populations. It will take time to root them out, and doing so must be the job of local forces on the ground, with training and air support from our coalition.""

The president offered no timetable for an Iraqi counterattack to reclaim Ramadi and did not announce any new steps to assist Iraqi troops in retaking the city, such as using American troops to call in airstrikes. But he insisted that the plans he announced last month were already bearing fruit. ""More Sunni volunteers are coming forward,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Some are already being trained, and they can be a new force against ISIL.""

The assault force would be led by Iraq's counterterrorism service and would include the Iraqi federal police and army soldiers. The effort is expected to number about 6,000 troops, according to an Iraqi war plan that has been significantly shaped by American advisers sent to Al Taqqadum, an Iraqi base east of Ramadi.

An Iraqi follow-on force of up to 5,000 tribal fighters along with Iraqi provincial police officers would be assigned to hold the city and nearby areas in Anbar Province if they were retaken from the Islamic State.

Iraqi Shiite militia, which the government calls the Popular Mobilization Force, will not join in the assault in Ramadi -- a decision intended to avoid inflaming sectarian tensions in the Sunni city. Instead, the plan calls for the militia to set blocking positions south and west of the city, hoping to prevent Islamic State fighters from escaping.

American-led air power and aerial surveillance, including armed drones, would support the Iraqi push to seize the city.

The roles and basic composition of the Iraqi forces in the offensive were described by American officials, who insisted the Iraqi attack plan is being carefully prepared. These officials did not discuss the specific tactics or provide the precise timing for the offensive.

This attention to planning and sensitivity to overpromising success follow statements in May by Ashton B. Carter, the defense secretary, that Iraqi forces had demonstrated ""no will to fight"" against the Islamic State forces that moved on Ramadi, as well as criticism by congressional Republicans that the Obama administration had not done enough to help the Iraqis succeed.

The decision to focus on Ramadi represents an important shift in strategy for the United States' military, whose Central Command initially urged the Iraqis to focus this spring or summer on reclaiming Mosul, the capital of Iraq's northern Nineveh Province that was seized by the Islamic State more than a year ago.

But the Iraqis complained that they were not prepared to move that quickly, and State Department officials argued that Anbar Province was of strategic importance because it borders Saudi Arabia and Jordan and is home to Sunni tribes whose support is vital for any campaign to challenge the Islamic State.

The Islamic State's success in May in taking Ramadi, which is the capital of Anbar Province and which lies 70 miles west of Baghdad, sealed the debate over strategy by shaking the Iraqi government and puncturing the Central Command's claim that the Islamic State was on the defensive.

The United States' attempt to regain the initiative comes as the Pentagon is preparing to turn over command of the American-led military campaign in the region to two highly regarded combat veterans of the Iraq war.

Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, commander of the Army's III Corps at Fort Hood, Tex., is expected to assume command over the effort in Iraq and Syria and will be based in Kuwait early this fall. He replaces Lt. Gen. James L. Terry.

As brigade commander, General MacFarland played an important role in the campaign to retake Ramadi and other contested parts of Anbar Province in 2007, and he worked closely with the Sunni tribes.

In another change, Maj. Gen. Richard D. Clarke, commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, took charge in Baghdad last week of ground operations in Iraq, replacing Maj. Gen. Paul E. Funk II as part of a regular rotation.

General Clarke, a West Point graduate, has served four combat tours in Iraq. One of his recent assignments was operations director for the military's secretive Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees the Army's Delta Force and the Navy's SEAL Team 6.

The challenges they will face will go far beyond the situation in and around Ramadi.

Anxious about the threat to Baghdad from suicide attacks and car bombs, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq has kept a sizable force focused on the defense of the capital, including the 57th Brigade, which defends the Green Zone.

""One of the steps he has taken is to surround Baghdad with much of the remaining Iraqi security forces,"" Mr. Carter told Congress last month.

Eager to roll back the Islamic State's gains, the United States has held discussions with Mr. Abadi about shifting some of the Baghdad-based troops to be a part of the counterattack force in Anbar and, eventually, in northern cities like Mosul.

But the Iraqi government has been uneasy about diverting a sizable number of the Baghdad-based units elsewhere or giving the Shiite militias even more of a role in the eastern part of the capital, American officials say.

Additionally, planning offensive operations has been hampered by the problem of ""ghost soldiers"" -- troops formally on the military personnel rolls but who are not actually on the job.

Iraqi officials say about 22,000 troops in the Defense and Interior Ministries have deserted their units. The problem is said to have been particularly acute in the Iraqi Seventh Division, which is stationed at the Al Asad base in Anbar Province. The Iraqis want to cancel the contracts of the missing troops so that the funds allocated to pay them can be used to recruit soldiers, American officials say.

To date, the United States has trained about 8,300 Iraqi soldiers at five sites around the country, and some 2,000 are still in training programs. But the training capacity the United States military has established is 6,700 soldiers at any one time.

So there is excess capacity: More than 4,000 additional Iraqi soldiers could be in training right now if the Iraqis supplied the recruits or thought the situation was secure enough to divert some troops from protecting the capital, American officials said.

But the Islamic State's gains in Ramadi also led to a course correction on the American side. In April, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggested that Ramadi was of secondary importance.

""The city itself is not symbolic in any way,"" said General Dempsey, who added that it was not ""central to the future of Iraq.""

Those remarks reflected the Central Command's focus on Mosul, which an official from the command reaffirmed publicly as late as February. After Ramadi fell, the American priority shifted to Anbar, and Mr. Obama ordered an additional 450 American forces to Al Taqqadum.

The American role at the base is to advise the tribes, guide the Iraqi military plan and ensure that the efforts of Sunni tribes are coordinated with Iraqi security forces, specifically the Iraqi Eighth Division and the military's Anbar Operations Center.

The American efforts are broadly consistent with Mr. Abadi's five-part plan, which was announced in late May and calls, in part, for mobilizing the tribes and recruiting more soldiers.

About 500 tribal fighters showed up for initial training at Al Taqqadum a week and half ago. Some 300 provincial police officers have also been training as a potential holding force. Ultimately, thousands of provincial police officers are to be retrained in an effort in which the Italians have the lead.

American officials say the focus at Al Taqqadum has been on what failed in the Iraqis' defense of Ramadi: sustainment, leadership and using their numerical advantage against ISIS.

These officials said it makes a big difference to have the American advisers on site at Al Taqqadum, working side by side with the Iraqis.

""Can this approach work?"" Mr. Carter said to reporters in Washington last Wednesday. ""The important thing there is that the only way to have a lasting defeat of ISIL is to have someone who can govern and secure territory once ISIL is defeated. That has to be a local force on the ground. That's why the strategy calls for the United States to help train and equip, and then help enable local ground forces.""

85,85,2015-08-03-CleanPowerPlan.txt,"Well, good afternoon everybody.

Gina, I want to thank you not just for the introduction, but for the incredible work that you and your team have been doing -- not just on this issue, but on generally making sure that we've got clean air, clean water, a great future for our kids.

I want to thank all the members of Congress who are here, as well, who have been fighting this issue, and sometimes at great odds with others, but are willing to take on what is going to be one of the key challenges of our lifetimes and future generations.  I want to thank our Surgeon General, whoâs just been doing outstanding work and is helping to make the connection between this critical issue and the health of our families.

Over the past six and a half years, we've taken on some of the toughest challenges of our time -- from rebuilding our economy after a devastating recession, to ending our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and bringing almost all of our troops home, to strengthening our security through tough and principled diplomacy.  But I am convinced that no challenge poses a greater threat to our future and future generations than a changing climate.  And that's what brings us here today.

Now, not everyone here is a scientist -- but some of you are among the best scientists in the world.  And what you and your colleagues have been showing us for years now is that human activities are changing the climate in dangerous ways. Levels of carbon dioxide, which heats up our atmosphere, are higher than theyâve been in 800,000 years; 2014 was the planetâs warmest year on record.  And we've been setting a lot of records in terms of warmest years over the last decade.  One year doesnât make a trend, but 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have fallen within the first 15 years of this century.

Climate change is no longer just about the future that we're predicting for our children or our grandchildren; it's about the reality that we're living with every day, right now.

The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.  While we can't say any single weather event is entirely caused by climate change, we've seen stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons.  Charleston and Miami now flood at high tide.  Shrinking ice caps forced National Geographic to make the biggest change in its atlas since the Soviet Union broke apart.

Over the past three decades, nationwide asthma rates have more than doubled, and climate change puts those Americans at greater risk of landing in the hospital.  As one of Americaâs governors has said, âWe're the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.â

And that's why I committed the United States to leading the world on this challenge, because I believe there is such a thing as being too late.

Most of the issues that I deal with -- and I deal with some tough issues that cross my desk -- by definition, I don't deal with issues if theyâre easy to solve because somebody else has already solved them.  And some of them are grim.  Some of them are heartbreaking.  Some of them are hard.  Some of them are frustrating.  But most of the time, the issues we deal with are ones that are temporally bound and we can anticipate things getting better if we just kind of plug away at it, even incrementally.  But this is one of those rare issues -- because of its magnitude, because of its scope -- that if we don't get it right we may not be able to reverse, and we may not be able to adapt sufficiently. There is such a thing as being too late when it comes to climate change.

Now, that shouldnât make us hopeless; it's not as if thereâs nothing we can do about it.  We can take action.  Over the past several years, America has been working to use less dirty energy, more clean energy, waste less energy throughout our economy.  We've set new fuel economy standards that mean our cars will go twice as far on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade. Combined with lower gas prices, these standards are on pace to save drivers an average of $700 at the pump this year.  We doubled down on our investment in renewable energy.  We're generating three times as much wind power, 20 times as much solar power as we did in 2008.

These steps are making a difference.  Over the past decade, even as our economy has continued to grow, the United States has cut our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.  That's the good news.  But I am here to say that if we want to protect our economy and our security and our childrenâs health, we're going to have to do more.  The science tells us we have to do more.

This has been our focus these past six years.  And it's particularly going to be our focus this month.  In Nevada, later in August, I'll talk about the extraordinary progress we've made in generating clean energy -- and the jobs that come with it -- and how we can boost that even further.  I'll also be the first American President to visit the Alaskan Arctic, where our fellow Americans have already seen their communities devastated by melting ice and rising oceans, the impact on marine life.  We're going to talk about what the world needs to do together to prevent the worst impacts of climate change before it's too late.

And today, we're here to announce Americaâs Clean Power Plan -- a plan two years in the making, and the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change.

Right now, our power plants are the source of about a third of Americaâs carbon pollution.  That's more pollution than our cars, our airplanes and our homes generate combined.  That pollution contributes to climate change, which degrades the air our kids breathe.  But there have never been federal limits on the amount of carbon that power plants can dump into the air.  Think about that.  We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur and arsenic in our air or our water -- and we're better off for it.  But existing power plants can still dump unlimited amounts of harmful carbon pollution into the air.

For the sake of our kids and the health and safety of all Americans, that has to change.  For the sake of the planet, that has to change.

So, two years ago, I directed Gina and the Environmental Protection Agency to take on this challenge.  And today, after working with states and cities and power companies, the EPA is setting the first-ever nationwide standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from power plants.

Hereâs how it works.  Over the next few years, each state will have the change to put together its own plan for reducing emissions -- because every state has a different energy mix.  Some generate more of their power from renewables; some from natural gas, or nuclear, or coal.  And this plan reflects the fact that not everybody is starting in the same place.  So we're giving states the time and the flexibility they need to cut pollution in a way that works for them.

And we'll reward the states that take action sooner instead of later -- because time is not on our side here.  As states work to meet their targets, they can build on the progress that our communities and businesses are already making.

A lot of power companies have already begun modernizing their plants, reducing their emissions -- and by the way, creating new jobs in the process.  Nearly a dozen states have already set up their own market-based programs to reduce carbon pollution.  About half of our states have set energy efficiency targets.  More than 35 have set renewable energy targets.  Over 1,000 mayors have signed an agreement to cut carbon pollution in their cities.  And last week, 13 of our biggest companies, including UPS and Walmart and GM, made bold, new commitments to cut their emissions and deploy more clean energy.

So the idea of setting standards and cutting carbon pollution is not new.  It's not radical.  What is new is that, starting today, Washington is starting to catch up with the vision of the rest of the country.  And by setting these standards, we can actually speed up our transition to a cleaner, safer future.

With this Clean Power Plan, by 2030, carbon pollution from our power plants will be 32 percent lower than it was a decade ago.  And the nerdier way to say that is that weâll be keeping 870 million tons of carbon dioxide pollution out of our atmosphere.  The simpler, laymanâs way of saying that is itâs like cutting every ounce of emission due to electricity from 108 million American homes.  Or it's the equivalent of taking 166 million cars off the road.

By 2030, we will reduce premature deaths from power plant emissions by nearly 90 percent -- and thanks to this plan, there will be 90,000 fewer asthma attacks among our children each year.  And by combining this with greater investment in our booming clean energy sector, and smarter investments in energy efficiency, and by working with the world to achieve a climate agreement by the end of this year, we can do more to slow, and maybe even eventually stop, the carbon pollution thatâs doing so much harm to our climate.

So this is the right thing to do.  I want to thank, again, Gina and her team for doing it the right way.  Over the longest engagement process in EPA history, they fielded more than 4 million public comments; they worked with states, they worked with power companies, and environmental groups, and faith groups, and people across our country to make sure that what we were doing was realistic and achievable, but still ambitious.

And some of those people are with us here today.  So, Tanya Brown -- Tanya, wave, go ahead -- thereâs Tanya. Tanya Brown has joined up with moms across America to spread the word about the dangers climate change pose to the health of our children -- including Tanyaâs daughter, Sanaa.  Thereâs Sanaa, right there.

Dr. Sumita Khatri has spent her career researching the health impacts of pollution at the Cleveland Clinic, and helping families whose lives are impacted every single day.  Doctor, thank you.

Sister Joan Marie Steadman has helped rally Catholic women across America to take on climate.  Sister, thank you so much for your leadership.  And sheâs got a pretty important guy on her side -- as Pope Francis made clear in his encyclical this summer, taking a stand against climate change is a moral obligation.  And Sister Steadman is living up to that obligation every single day.

Now, letâs be clear.  There will be critics of what weâre trying to do.  There will be cynics that say it cannot be done.  Long before the details of this Clean Power Plan were even decided, the special interests and their allies in Congress were already mobilizing to oppose it with everything theyâve got. They will claim that this plan will cost you money -- even though this plan, the analysis shows, will ultimately save the average American nearly $85 a year on their energy bills.

Theyâll claim we need to slash our investments in clean energy, it's a waste of money -- even though theyâre happy to spend billions of dollars a year in subsidizing oil companies.  Theyâll claim this plan will kill jobs -- even though our transition to a cleaner energy economy has the solar industry, to just name one example, creating jobs 10 times faster than the rest of the economy.

Theyâll claim this plan is a âwar on coal,â to scare up votes -- even as they ignore my plan to actually invest in revitalizing coal country, and supporting health care and retirement for coal miners and their families, and retraining those workers for better-paying jobs and healthier jobs.  Communities across America have been losing coal jobs for decades.  I want to work with Congress to help them, not to use them as a political football.  Partisan press releases arenât going to help those families.

Even more cynical, we've got critics of this plan who are actually claiming that this will harm minority and low-income communities -- even though climate change hurts those Americans the most, who are the most vulnerable.  Today, an African-American child is more than twice as likely to be hospitalized from asthma; a Latino child is 40 percent more likely to die from asthma.  So if you care about low-income, minority communities, start protecting the air that they breathe, and stop trying to rob them of their health care. You could also expand Medicaid in your states, by the way.

Hereâs the thing.  We've heard these same stale arguments before.  Every time America has made progress, it's been despite these kind of claims.  Whenever America has set clear rules and smarter standards for our air, our water, our childrenâs health, we get the same scary stories about killing jobs and businesses and freedom.  It's true.

I'm going to go off script here just for a second.  Because this is important -- because sometimes I think we feel as if thereâs nothing we can do.  Tomorrow is my birthday, so I'm starting to reflect on age.  And in thinking about what we were doing here today, I was reminded about landing in Los Angeles to attend a college as a freshman, as an 18-year-old.  And it was late August.  I was moving from Hawaii.  And I got to the campus, and I decided -- I had a lot of pent-up energy and I wanted to go take a run.  And after about five minutes, suddenly I had this weird feeling, I couldn't breathe.  And the reason was, back in 1979, Los Angeles still was so full of smog that there were days where people who were vulnerable just could not go outside.  And they were fairly frequent.

And folks who are older than me can remember the Cayuga River burning because of pollution, and acid rain threatening to destroy all the great forests of the Northeast.  And you fast-forward 30, 40 years later, and we solved those problems.  But at the time, the same characters who are going to be criticizing this plan were saying, this is going to kill jobs, this is going to destroy businesses, this is going to hurt low-income people, it's going to be wildly expensive.  And each time, they were wrong.

And because we pushed through, despite those scaremongering tactics, you can actually run in Los Angeles without choking.  And folks can actually take a boat out on that river.  And those forests are there.

So we got to learn lessons.  We got to know our history.  The kinds of criticisms that you're going to hear are simply excuses for inaction.  Theyâre not even good business sense.  They underestimate American business and American ingenuity.

In 1970, when Republican President Richard Nixon decided to do something about the smog that was choking our cities, they warned that the new pollution standards would decimate the auto industry.  It didnât happen.  Catalytic converters worked.  Taking the lead out of gasoline worked.  Our air got cleaner.

In 1990, when Republican President George H.W. Bush decided to do something about acid rain, they said the bills would go up, our lights would go off, businesses would suffer âa quiet death.â It didnât happen.  We cut acid rain dramatically, and it cost much less than anybody expected -- because businesses, once incentivized, were able to figure it out.

When we restricted leaded fuel in our cars, cancer-causing chemicals in plastics, it didnât end the oil industry, it didnât end the plastics industry; American chemists came up with better substitutes.  The fuel standards we put in place a couple of years ago didnât cripple automakers.  The American auto industry retooled.  Today, our automakers are selling the best cars in the world at a faster pace than they have in almost a decade.  Theyâve got more hybrids, and more plug-ins, and more high fuel-efficient cars, giving consumers more choice than ever before, and saving families at the pump.

We can figure this stuff out as long as we're not lazy about it; as long as we don't take the path of least resistance.  Scientists, citizens, workers, entrepreneurs -- together as Americans, we disrupt those stale, old debates, upend old ways of thinking.  Right now, weâre inventing whole new technologies, whole new industries -- not looking backwards, we're looking forwards.

And if we don't do it, nobody will.  The only reason that China is now looking at getting serious about its emissions is because they saw that we were going to do it, too.  When the world faces its toughest challenges, America leads the way forward.  Thatâs what this plan is about.

Now, I don't want to fool you here.  This is going to be hard; dealing with climate change in its entirety, it's challenging.  No single action, no single country will change the warming of the planet on its own.  But today, with America leading the way, countries representing 70 percent of the carbon pollution from the worldâs energy sector have announced plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.  In December, with America leading the way, we have a chance to put in place one of the most ambitious international climate agreements in human history.

And itâs easy to be cynical and to say climate change is the kind of challenge thatâs just too big for humanity to solve.  I am absolutely convinced thatâs wrong.  We can solve this thing. But we have to get going.  It's exactly the kind of challenge that's big enough to remind us that weâre all in this together.

Last month, for the first time since 1972, NASA released a âblue marble,â a single snapshot of the Earth taken from outer space.  And so much has changed in the decades between that first picture and the second.  Borders have shifted, generations have come and gone, our global population has nearly doubled.  But one thing hasnât changed -- our planet is as beautiful as ever.  It still looks blue.  And it's as vast, but also as fragile, as miraculous as anything in this universe.

This âblue marbleâ belongs to all of us.  It belongs to these kids who are here.  There are more than 7 billion people alive today; no matter what country theyâre from, no matter what language they speak, every one of them can look at this image and say, âThatâs my home.â  And âweâre the first generation to feel the impact of climate change; we're the last generation that can do something about it.â  We only get one home.  We only get one planet.  Thereâs no plan B.

I don't want my grandkids not to be able to swim in Hawaii, or not to be able to climb a mountain and see a glacier because we didnât do something about it.  I don't want millions of peopleâs lives disrupted and this world more dangerous because we didnât do something about it.  That would be shameful of us.  This is our moment to get this right and leave something better for our kids.  Letâs make most of that opportunity.

Thank you, everybody.  God bless you. God bless the United States of America.
","A new rule mandating the first-ever federal limits on power-plant carbon emissions aims to change the way Americans make and consume electricity, accelerating a shift already under way toward cleaner fuels, renewable energy and consumer-generated power.

The regulations, which will be unveiled by President Barack Obama at a White House event Monday, are part of a broader push by the administration to position the U.S. as a leader in tackling climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency regulations are central to the administration's submission to an international climate conference set for December in Paris.

White House officials say Mr. Obama views addressing climate change as part of his legacy. He announced an aggressive climate deal with China in November and has put the issue high on the agenda in meetings with world leaders in recent months. The president also will discuss climate change with Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. next month, following the pope's release of an encyclical on the issue in June.

""This rule enhances in important ways our ability to achieve the international commitments that we have made,"" Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, told reporters Sunday.

But divisions at home cast some doubt on the administration's ability to fully implement the regulations, which were released in draft form a year ago.

Industry officials say they are worried about the plan's cost and timetable. Republicans in Congress and states hardest hit by the plan say they will fight it. More than a dozen states and the coal industry have vowed to sue the EPA, and several states have threatened to refuse to comply with the rule.

The rule would require a 32% cut in power-plant carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels, an increase from the 30% target proposed last year. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said Sunday the rule would result in an estimated annual cost of $8.4 billion by 2030 and have total benefits, including public-health benefits, of $34 billion to $54 billion per year by then.

The regulations require states to draft their own plans to reduce power-plant emissions to reach an overall carbon reduction target nationwide. States would have to put in place compliance plans by 2018 and meet their first targets for reductions by 2022. As with the draft rule released last year, the EPA would impose a federal plan on states that don't comply, according to the administration.

The final rule calls for the nation to get 28% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2030, versus roughly 13% last year. Industry experts say cutting carbon emissions 32% by 2030 will require billions of dollars in investments for new transmission lines that accommodate more solar and wind power and new pipelines to feed natural-gas-fired power plants, as coal becomes less important as a fuel.

U.S. electric utilities have already taken steps to shift to less carbon-intensive fuels, and they worry about the degree to which their whole system will need to be upgraded to accommodate more renewable energy, much of it generated by customers with solar panels or other equipment.

The industry, experts said, expects to spend more than $100 billion next year on capital projects, and will adjust its spending programs to reflect the new rules even as court challenges proceed.

""Utilities already are moving in that direction by retiring coal plants and adding renewables,"" said Nick Akins, chief executive of Ohio-based American Electric Power Co., one of the nation's biggest utilities, which has been a major user of coal. Though some states may object to the EPA rule, he said, most utilities ""will be reaching out to our states and be very factual and objective and see if we can comply.""

Executives worry about the EPA plan's cost, in part because it could result in shutting power plants that aren't yet paid off, Mr. Akins said, meaning consumers will have to pay for assets that aren't providing benefits.

Administration officials said Sunday they had taken industry concerns into account in the year since the draft was released. Most significantly, the final rule pushes back the first year that states must begin complying, to 2022 from 2020.

In another nod to industry concerns, the final rule would help encourage nuclear power generation, which doesn't emit any carbon and accounts for about 20% of the U.S.'s electricity.

Nuclear reactors under construction in Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia will get credit toward compliance with the rule, a change from the proposal, according to the administration. Nuclear plants that boost their output also will get more credit.

One industry concern is the final rule seeks to prevent a wholesale shift to natural gas. Over the past few years, utilities have been burning more gas, which produces 50% less carbon emissions than coal but still more than zero-emitting sources like wind and nuclear power. That shift has been helped along by the domestic boom in gas production since 2008 aided by new drilling methods such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.

The 2014 draft rule relied on a large and early shift from coal to natural gas. The final regulations would remove that assumption and instead create a new program to encourage states to deploy more renewable energy and energy efficiency by giving credits toward compliance on such projects that begin construction early on.

Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said the rule would increase utility consumption of natural gas by 7.1 billion cubic feet a day, or 32%, enough to lift national demand for it by about 10%. The big loser -- the coal industry -- will see consumption drop 23% by 2020, adding to the crisis already rocking mining. Some opponents have labeled the rule a ""war on coal.""

""We'll hear the same tired plays from the same special-interest playbook, but the American people know better,"" Ms. McCarthy said.

To date, states including California and nine in the Northeast have been in the minority in devising programs to trim carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change.

The new rule ""will act like an accelerant,"" said Ted Craver, chief executive of California-based Edison International, parent of Southern California Edison. ""Now all the states will have to grapple with the need to reduce carbon emissions.""

Electric-grid operators would need to make sure their systems can handle power flowing from decentralized sources, such as millions of rooftop solar systems and thousands of wind turbines.

Utilities have been shutting coal plants for several years to satisfy other EPA rules. Since 2011, Duke Energy Corp. says it has retired 40 older coal units in the Carolinas and the Midwest and replaced them with super-efficient coal units or gas-fired plants at a total cost of $9 billion.
","In the strongest action ever taken in the United States to combat climate change, President Obama will unveil on Monday a set of environmental regulations devised to sharply cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from the nation's power plants and ultimately transform America's electricity industry.

The rules are the final, tougher versions of proposed regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2012 and 2014. If they withstand the expected legal challenges, the regulations will set in motion sweeping policy changes that could shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants, freeze construction of new coal plants and create a boom in the production of wind and solar power and other renewable energy sources.

As the president came to see the fight against climate change as central to his legacy, as important as the Affordable Care Act, he moved to strengthen the energy proposals, advisers said. The health law became the dominant political issue of the 2010 congressional elections and faced dozens of legislative assaults before surviving two Supreme Court challenges largely intact.

""Climate change is not a problem for another generation, not anymore,"" Mr. Obama said in a video posted on Facebook at midnight Saturday. He called the new rules ""the biggest, most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change.""

The most aggressive of the regulations requires the nation's existing power plants to cut emissions 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, an increase from the 30 percent target proposed in the draft regulation.

That new rule also demands that power plants use more renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power. While the proposed rule would have allowed states to lower emissions by transitioning from plants fired by coal to plants fired by natural gas, which produces about half the carbon pollution of coal, the final rule is intended to push electric utilities to invest more quickly in renewable sources, raising to 28 percent from 22 percent the share of generating capacity that would come from such sources.

In its final version, the rule retains the same basic structure as the draft proposal: It assigns each state a target for reducing its carbon pollution from power plants, but allows states to create their own custom plans for doing so. States have to submit an initial version of their plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018.

But over all, the final rule is even stronger than earlier drafts and can be seen as an effort by Mr. Obama to stake out an uncompromising position on the issue during his final months in office.

The anticipated final climate change regulations have already set off what is expected to be broad legal, legislative and political backlash as dozens of states, major corporations and industry groups prepare to file lawsuits challenging them.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, has started an unusual pre-emptive campaign against the rules, asking governors to refuse to comply. Attorneys general from more than a dozen states are preparing legal challenges against the plan. Experts estimate that as many as 25 states will join in a suit against the rules and that the disputes will end up before the Supreme Court.

Leading the legal charge are states like Wyoming and West Virginia with economies that depend heavily on coal mining or cheap coal-fired electricity. Emissions from coal-fired power plants are the nation's single largest source of carbon pollution, and lawmakers who oppose the rules have denounced them as a ""war on coal.""

""Once the E.P.A. finalizes this regulation, West Virginia will go to court, and we will challenge it,"" Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general of West Virginia, said in an interview with a radio station in the state on Friday. ""We think this regulation is terrible for the consumers of the state of West Virginia. It's going to lead to reduced jobs, higher electricity rates, and really will put stress on the reliability of the power grid. The worst part of this proposal is that it's flatly illegal under the Clean Air Act and the Constitution, and we intend to challenge it vigorously.""

Although Obama administration officials have repeatedly said states will have flexibility to design their own plans, the final rules are explicitly meant to encourage the use of interstate cap-and-trade systems, in which states place a cap on carbon pollution and then create a market for buying permits or credits to pollute. The idea is that forcing companies to pay to pollute will drive them to cleaner sources of energy.

Mr. Obama tried but failed to push through a cap-and-trade bill in his first term, and since then, the term has become politically toxic: Republicans have attacked the idea as ""cap and tax.""

But if the climate change regulations withstand legal challenges, many states could still end up putting cap-and-trade systems into effect. Officials familiar with the final rules said that in many cases, the easiest and cheapest way for states to comply would be by adopting cap-and-trade systems.

The rules take into account the fact that some states may refuse to submit plans, and on Monday, the administration will also unveil a template for a plan to be imposed on such states. That plan will include the option of allowing a state to join an interstate cap-and-trade system.

The rules will also offer financial benefits for states that choose to take part in cap-and-trade systems. The final rules will extend until 2022 the timeline for states and electric utilities to comply, two years later than originally proposed. But states that begin to take actions to cut carbon pollution as early as 2020 will be rewarded with carbon reduction credits -- essentially, pollution permits that can be sold for cash in a cap-and-trade market.

Climate scientists warn that rising greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly moving the planet toward a global atmospheric temperature increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point past which the world will be locked into a future of rising sea levels, more devastating storms and droughts, and shortages of food and water. Mr. Obama's new rules alone will not be enough to stave off that future. But experts say that if the rules are combined with similar action from the world's other major economies, as well as additional action by the next American president, emissions could level off enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change.

Mr. Obama intends to use the new rules to push other countries to commit to deep reductions in their own carbon emissions before a United Nations summit meeting in Paris in December, when a global accord to fight climate change is expected to be signed.

Mr. Obama's pledge that the United States would enact the climate change rules was at the heart of a pact that he made last year with President Xi Jinping of China, committing their nations, the world's two largest carbon polluters, to substantially cut emissions.

""It's the linchpin of the administration's domestic effort and international effort on climate change,"" said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a research organization. ""It raises the diplomatic stakes in the run-up to Paris. He can take it on the road and use it as leverage with other big economies -- China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia.""

While opponents of the rules have estimated that compliance will cost billions of dollars, raise residential electricity rates and slow the American economy, the administration argues that the rules will save the average American family $85 annually in electricity costs and bring additional health benefits by reducing emissions of pollutants that cause asthma and lung disease.

The rules will be announced at a White House ceremony on Monday and signed by Gina McCarthy, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator. While the ceremony is scheduled to take place on the White House's South Lawn, officials said it might be moved indoors to the East Room after forecasters predicted that the weather would be too hot.

86,86,2015-09-24-PopeFrancis.txt,"Good morning!

What a beautiful day the Lord has made!

Holy Father, on behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House.  I should explain that our backyard is not typically this crowded -- but the size and spirit of todayâs gathering is just a small reflection of the deep devotion of some 70 million American Catholics.  It reflects, as well, the way that your message of love and hope has inspired so many people across our nation and around the world.  So on behalf of the American people, it is my great honor and privilege to welcome you to the United States of America.

Today, we mark many firsts.  Your Holiness, you have been celebrated as the first Pope from the Americas.  This is your first visit to the United States.  And you are also the first pontiff to share an encyclical through a Twitter account.

Holy Father, your visit not only allows us, in some small way, to reciprocate the extraordinary hospitality that you extended to me at the Vatican last year.  It also reveals how much all Americans, from every background and every faith, value the role that the Catholic Church plays in strengthening America.  From my time working in impoverished neighborhoods with the Catholic Church in Chicago, to my travels as President, Iâve seen firsthand how, every single day, Catholic communities, priests, nuns, laity are feeding the hungry, healing the sick, sheltering the homeless, educating our children, and fortifying the faith that sustains so many.  

And what is true in America is true around the world.  From the busy streets of Buenos Aires to the remote villages in Kenya, Catholic organizations serve the poor, minister to prisoners, build schools, build homes, operate orphanages and hospitals.  And just as the Church has stood with those struggling to break the chains of poverty, the Church so often has given voice and hope to those seeking to break the chains of violence and oppression.  

And yet, I believe the excitement around your visit, Holy Father, must be attributed not only to your role as Pope, but to your unique qualities as a person.  In your humility, your embrace of simplicity, in the gentleness of your words and the generosity of your spirit, we see a living example of Jesusâ teachings, a leader whose moral authority comes not just through words but also through deeds.

You call on all of us, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, to put the âleast of theseâ at the center of our concerns.  You remind us that in the eyes of God our measure as individuals, and our measure as a society, is not determined by wealth or power or station or celebrity, but by how well we hew to Scriptureâs call to lift up the poor and the marginalized -- to stand up for justice and against inequality, and to ensure that every human being is able to live in dignity -- because we are all made in the image of God.

You remind us that âthe Lordâs most powerful messageâ is mercy.  And that means welcoming the stranger with empathy and a truly open heart -- from the refugee who flees war-torn lands to the immigrant who leaves home in search of a better life.  It means showing compassion and love for the marginalized and the outcast, to those who have suffered, and those who have caused suffering and seek redemption.  You remind us of the costs of war, particularly on the powerless and defenseless, and urge us toward the imperative of peace.

Holy Father, we are grateful for your invaluable support of our new beginning with the Cuban people -- which holds out the promise of better relations between our countries, greater cooperation across our hemisphere, and a better life for the Cuban people.  We thank you for your passionate voice against the deadly conflicts that ravage the lives of so many men, women and children, and your call for nations to resist the sirens of war and resolve disputes through diplomacy. 

You remind us that people are only truly free when they can practice their faith freely.  Here in the United States, we cherish religious liberty.  It was the basis for so much of what brought us together.  And here in the United States, we cherish our religious liberty, but around the world, at this very moment, children of God, including Christians, are targeted and even killed because of their faith.  Believers are prevented from gathering at their places of worship.  The faithful are imprisoned, and churches are destroyed.  So we stand with you in defense of religious freedom and interfaith dialogue, knowing that people everywhere must be able to live out their faith free from fear and free from intimidation.

And, Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet, Godâs magnificent gift to us.  We support your call to all world leaders to support the communities most vulnerable to changing climate, and to come together to preserve our precious world for future generations.

Your Holiness, in your words and deeds, you set a profound moral example.  And in these gentle but firm reminders of our obligations to God and to one another, you are shaking us out of complacency.  All of us may, at times, experience discomfort when we contemplate the distance between how we lead our daily lives and what we know to be true, what we know to be right.  But I believe such discomfort is a blessing, for it points to something better.  You shake our conscience from slumber; you call on us to rejoice in Good News, and give us confidence that we can come together in humility and service, and pursue a world that is more loving, more just, and more free.  Here at home and around the world, may our generation heed your call to ânever remain on the sidelines of this march of living hope.â

For that great gift of hope, Holy Father, we thank you, and welcome you, with joy and gratitude, to the United States of America.
","Pope Francis, during a day wrapped in ceremonial fanfare for the first public events of his landmark U.S. visit, challenged America's political and Catholic leaders, bringing a pointed yet conciliatory message to a country embroiled in debates over climate change, immigration, gay marriage and religious freedoms.

On each issue and at each stop on Wednesday -- from the White House to Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception to a speech to U.S. Catholic bishops -- the pope urged dialogue over opposing views, while standing firm on the Church's moral teachings.

He even waded into a fraught legal struggle between Catholic institutions and the federal government by paying an unplanned afternoon visit to an order of nuns. Pope Francis visited the Little Sisters of the Poor in what his spokesman called a ""sign of support"" for their demands, so far unsuccessful, for a conscience exemption to the contraception mandate in the health-care law.

By the end of a day that included cheering crowds as he paraded along the National Mall in his open-air popemobile, Pope Francis had both defended and challenged the positions of Democratic and Republican politicians -- and even U.S. bishops.

He endorsed climate-change initiatives President Barack Obama and fellow Democrats support and many Republicans oppose, saying ""it seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to our future generation.""

""When it comes to the care of our 'common home,' we are living at a critical moment of history,"" the 78-year-old pontiff said.

The pope's remarks, delivered in English, also gave credence to GOP arguments in Congress and on the campaign trail that some of Mr. Obama's core policies infringe on Americans' religious freedoms, such as his support for the Supreme Court ruling in favor of gay marriage.

A ""truly tolerant and inclusive"" society respects Catholics' ""deepest concerns and their right to religious liberty,"" the pope said, noting the church's rejection of ""every form of unjust discrimination,"" a phrase found in the Catechism of the Church in regard to ""homosexual persons.""

The pope arrived in Washington on Tuesday, following a visit to Cuba. He will address a joint session of Congress Thursday morning -- the first pontiff to do so. Later in the week, he travels to New York, where he will address the United Nations General Assembly. He closes his trip with a visit to Philadelphia over the weekend, including a Mass on Sunday expected to draw more than a million pilgrims.

The Argentine pontiff set the tone for his first-ever visit to the U.S. at the start of his first full day. ""As a son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families,"" he said at the start of brief remarks during an elaborate White House welcoming ceremony.

The comments came as immigration is under fierce debate in the 2016 presidential race and as efforts to pass an overhaul of the system have stalled in Congress due to party divisions.

""Our mission as bishops is first and foremost to solidify unity,"" he said. ""This service to unity is particularly important for this nation, whose vast . . . resources impose significant moral responsibilities"" for world ""peace, prosperity and integration.""

Later, in a speech to bishops, Pope Francis again touched on the issue of immigration, calling for special attention to the influx of Latin-American immigrants in the Catholic Church -- a group that is the main driver of growth of the faith in the U.S. He told the bishops that they may be challenged by such diversity but that these immigrants have resources that should be shared.

The pope largely avoided the scandal that has seriously undermined the U.S. church -- sexual abuse of minors by priests. He made only a brief reference to the problem in remarks to the bishops, thanking U.S. church leaders for working to ensure that such crimes won't be repeated while making no mention of punishing abusive priests or church leaders who covered up incidents. The pope is expected to meet victims of sex abuse during his visit.

The pontiff, through his policy pronouncements, presented himself as a unifying figure in a deeply divided country.

Democrats and Republicans, who are at odds in current policy debates, agree on their admiration of Pope Francis. The pope's White House arrival ceremony drew Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike, and GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush attended Mass with the pontiff.

Both parties sought to highlight areas where the pope bolstered their views while playing down areas where he didn't.

Mr. Obama thanked Pope Francis for his key role in supporting his effort to restore U.S. diplomatic relations with Cuba and highlighted the pontiff's endorsement of his climate-change initiatives.

""Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet -- God's magnificent gift to us,"" Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama's aides hope the pope's support of initiatives to combat climate change will boost the chances of a broad agreement at an international meeting on the problem this December in Paris.

The pope, who in a major encyclical published last May threw his support behind those arguing that human activity is contributing to climate change, has been unusually forthright in saying he hopes the Paris meeting will produce new solutions.

Republicans, by contrast, seized on the pope's comments on religious freedom and gay marriage.

""I was encouraged that Pope Francis began his first speech in the U.S. by expressing appreciation for America's founding principles, especially religious liberty, and the importance of traditional marriage, family and the sanctity of life to our culture,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R., Kan.). Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.) said he was ""grateful to hear Pope Francis bring up the importance of religious liberty.""

Yet it is unclear the pope's message will change the tone of policy debates in Washington.

""Everybody wants a clean planet, everybody wants to take care of those who are less fortunate,"" said Rep. Tom Rooney (R., Fla.). ""I believe this pope is saying the right things about how I should live my life as an individual and how I should raise my children. How that translates into public policy, I just think is very different.""

Thousands of people turned out for the pope on Wednesday. The day began with Mr. Obama welcoming the pope at the White House, where more than 11,000 were gathered on the South Lawn.

After the public event, Mr. Obama gave Pope Francis a tour of the White House and the two met privately for 40 minutes, without aides, in the Oval Office.

They discussed a range of issues, according to the White House, including the moral responsibility to offer refuge to people who are forced to flee their homelands and the right of all people to practice their faith.

The pope ended his day by celebrating an outdoor Mass where he proclaimed Father Junipero Serra, the friar considered the father of California's missions, a saint.


","Welcomed with a fanfare of trumpets and a chorus of amens, Pope Francis introduced himself to the United States on Wednesday with a bracing message on climate change, immigration and poverty that ranged from the pastoral to the political.

On a day that blended the splendor of an ancient church with the frenzy of a modern rock star tour, Francis waded quietly but forcefully into some of the most polarizing issues of American civic life. Along the way, he underscored just how much he has upended the agenda of the Roman Catholic Church and reordered its priorities.

Perhaps no one was more pleased than President Obama, who greeted him with an elaborate arrival ceremony at the White House, where the pope explicitly embraced the administration's efforts to combat climate change. At a later speech to American bishops, Francis, the first pope from Latin America, pressed for openness to immigrants, marking a signal day for Hispanics in the United States.

While the last two popes focused on traditional moral issues like abortion and homosexuality, Francis left those to the side in Mr. Obama's presence. With the bishops, he spoke about the ""innocent victim of abortion"" but mentioned the issue as only one of a long list of concerns, including children who die of hunger or in bombings, immigrants who ""drown in the search for a better tomorrow"" and an environment ""devastated by man's predatory relationship with nature.""

""Humanity has the ability to work together in building our common home,"" the pope told a crowd of thousands on the South Lawn of the White House in his first major speech in English. ""As Christians inspired by this certainty, we wish to commit ourselves to the conscious and responsible care of our common home.""

Still, in a low-key but evident break with Mr. Obama, Francis at the end of the day made a previously unannounced stop to see the nuns at the Little Sisters of the Poor to underscore his support for religious freedom, a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said. The Little Sisters religious order sued the federal government over the birth control mandate in Mr. Obama's Affordable Care Act.

Wearing his white cassock and skullcap, Francis was greeted everywhere he went by joyful crowds. Catholics and non-Catholics alike juggled their cellphones and small flags of the Holy See as they craned for a glimpse of the 266th pope -- only the fourth to visit the United States and third to visit Washington.

The spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Catholics led a short parade around the Ellipse in his open-air popemobile, waving and making the sign of the cross as Vatican officials brought him babies to kiss. He later celebrated Mass for more than 20,000 people and presided over the first canonization in the United States.

In his first visit to the United States, Francis, 78, seemed eager to pass over his previous criticisms of a materialistic, capitalist culture and instead reach out to the world's most powerful nation. He praised the country's devotion to freedom of liberty and religion even as he cautioned that its vast resources demanded a deep sense of moral responsibility. ""God bless America,"" he said at the White House.

The pope arrived at the White House in a modest Fiat to find a crowd of 11,000 people, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Secretary of State John Kerry and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic minority leader, all Catholics, as well as about half of the members of Congress. The White House rolled out its best color guards, including a fife-and-drum corps, but opted against the 21-gun salute that is traditional for such ceremonies.

Mr. Obama thanked the pope for his help in restoring American diplomatic relations with Cuba and hailed him for speaking out for the world's most impoverished. ""You shake our conscience from slumber,"" he said. ""You call on us to rejoice in good news and give us confidence that we can come together, in humility and service, and pursue a world that is more loving, more just and more free.""

In his own remarks, the pope noted the country's origins at a time when critics of illegal immigration were pushing to build a wall at the southern border. ""As the son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families,"" Francis said.

He devoted more of his address to climate change than any other topic. ""Mr. President,"" Francis said, ""I find it encouraging that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution."" He added that there was still time to heal the planet for its children. ""To use a telling phrase of the Rev. Martin Luther King, we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note, and now is the time to honor it,"" he said.

The ceremony brought together two men with starkly disparate backgrounds and yet commonalities that have united them now, a community organizer from Chicago and a priest from Argentina, both presenting themselves as champions of those without any. While they first met last year at the Vatican, their appearance on Wednesday carried a visual and possibly a political power that solidified the impression of a secular-theological alliance.

Republicans, who have said they disagree with the pope on climate change and capitalism, nonetheless largely kept such thoughts to themselves and instead focused instead on the majesty of the day. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican presidential candidate who converted to Catholicism, attended the afternoon Mass with the pope and posted a picture on Twitter.

After meeting alone with the president and an interpreter in the Oval Office, the pope went to the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, where the crowd swelled so deep that for many the only sign of the pope's arrival was a cheer echoing through nearby streets. A crowd of more than 50 people inside a restaurant pressed against windows facing the cathedral and stood eagerly on chairs to get a better view.

As the pope entered the cathedral, the rector, Msgr. W. Ronald Jameson, threw his arms open wide. As he walked down the church's center aisle between rows of bishops in pink zucchettos, some of them held up phones and cameras to take pictures.

Archbishop Alexander Sample of Portland, Ore., posted on Twitter from his seat in the pews: ""Pope Francis has arrived!""

Addressing nearly 300 bishops, whom he referred to as his brothers, the pope was warm and encouraging, but he also spoke clearly and with simple language that was unmistakable in its emphasis. He praised the bishops for their work on behalf of immigrants, and for the first time praised their ""courage"" in handling the church's sexual abuse scandals.

""I am also conscious of the courage with which you have faced difficult moments in the recent history of the church in this country without fear of self-criticism and at the cost of mortification and great sacrifice,"" the pope told the bishops.

Those remarks brought applause from the bishops but later drew indignation from survivors of sexual abuse and their advocates. Dennis Coday, the editor of The National Catholic Reporter, an independent outlet that helped reveal sexual abuse by priests, said the pope's comments would prompt victims to conclude, ""He just doesn't get it.""

Speaking to bishops who have not always agreed with his spiritual emphasis, the pope said that he had ""not come to judge you or to lecture you."" But he said the ""style of our mission"" should make parishioners feel that the message was meant for them. ""Be pastors close to people, pastors who are neighbors and servants,"" he instructed.

Francis also pressed his case for particular attention to immigrants and refugees as a primary responsibility of the church. Speaking of the recent surge of migration from Latin America, he acknowledged that parishes may be ""challenged by their diversity.""

""But know that they also possess resources meant to be shared -- so do not be afraid to welcome them,"" he said. ""I am certain that, as so often in the past, these people will enrich America and its church.""

Latinos who flocked to see the pontiff said they were not surprised that he would highlight an issue of critical importance to a community with increasing influence in American politics -- and an expanding target for political backlash.

""He understands Americans -- he is one,"" Oscar Lefranc, 55, said. ""He's lived it. He's experienced it.""

Later in the afternoon, the pope went to the campus of Catholic University of America to celebrate his first Mass in the United States and to canonize JunÃ­pero Serra, a Franciscan who founded missions across California in the 1700s.

The pope greeted the enthusiastic crowd before entering the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the nation's largest Roman Catholic church.

Before the homily, the pope declared Father Serra to be a saint. ""Having given mature deliberation and having begged the help of divine grace, and the opinion of many of our brothers, blessed JunÃ­pero Serra we discern and define to be a saint,"" the pope said, speaking in Spanish.

Olga Herrera, 30, and eight other members of a young-adults group at St. Camillus Catholic Church of Silver Spring, Md., all of them from Guatemala, cheered when Francis accepted the proclamation made on behalf of Father Serra's sainthood.

87,87,2015-10-02-UmpquaShooting.txt,"Thereâs been another mass shooting in America -- this time, in a community college in Oregon.

That means there are more American families -- moms, dads, children -- whose lives have been changed forever.  That means thereâs another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children.  

Iâve been to Roseburg, Oregon.  There are really good people there.  I want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today.  Federal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role, and weâve offered to stay and help as much as Roseburg needs, for as long as they need.

In the coming days, weâll learn about the victims -- young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives.  And America will wrap everyone whoâs grieving with our prayers and our love.  

But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough.  Itâs not enough.  It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel.  And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America -- next week, or a couple of months from now.

We don't yet know why this individual did what he did.  And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations may be.  But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people.  We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.  

Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, âThe United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws -- even in the face of repeated mass killings.â  And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana.  That day!  Somehow this has become routine.  The reporting is routine.  My response here at this podium ends up being routine.  The conversation in the aftermath of it.  We've become numb to this.

We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston.  It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.  

And whatâs become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation.  Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out:  We need more guns, theyâll argue.  Fewer gun safety laws.  

Does anybody really believe that?  There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country -- they know that's not true.  We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws -- including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.  

There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America.  So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer?  We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.  So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence.

We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings.  Friends of ours, allies of ours -- Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours.  So we know there are ways to prevent it.  

And, of course, whatâs also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.  Well, this is something we should politicize.  It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.  I would ask news organizations -- because I won't put these facts forward -- have news organizations tally up the number of Americans whoâve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans whoâve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.  This won't be information coming from me; it will be coming from you.  We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so.  And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths.  How can that be?

This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America.  We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.  When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer.  When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer.  When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce auto fatalities.  We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives.  So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations doesnât make sense.

So, tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, Iâd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up.  And that will require a change of politics on this issue.  And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision.  If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.

And I would particularly ask Americaâs gun owners -- who are using those guns properly, safely, to hunt, for sport, for protecting their families -- to think about whether your views are properly being represented by the organization that suggests it's speaking for you.

And each time this happens I'm going to bring this up.  Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws.  And this is not something I can do by myself.  I've got to have a Congress and I've got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this.  

I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances.  But based on my experience as President, I can't guarantee that.  And that's terrible to say.

And it can change.

May God bless the memories of those who were killed today.  May He bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back.  And may He give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change.

Thank you.
","Students and police described a scene of chaos and horror when a gunman opened fire at a rural college here on Thursday, killing at least nine and wounding seven in this tight-knit timber community.

Local and federal law-enforcement officials were still trying to piece together details of what happened Thursday morning at Umpqua Community College just outside of Roseburg, a town of about 22,000 around 180 miles south of Portland.

Chris Harper Mercer, the 26-year-old gunman, was killed during a shootout with officers, law-enforcement officials said. Earlier, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said the shooter was 20 years old. Officials said they don't know what motivated Mr. Mercer.

Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, who refused to say the gunman's name, said Thursday night that authorities may not release the names of victims for at least a day pending identification, and notification of kin. ""I will not name the shooter,"" he said. ""I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act.""

Shortly before 10:40 a.m. local time, Douglas County authorities began receiving 911 calls reporting a shooting at the college, which was holding its first week of classes.

A law-enforcement official with knowledge of the situation said initial reports indicated that three handguns and one long gun were recovered from the scene.

""We are holding the community of Douglas County in our hearts today,"" Gov. Brown said before heading to the school.

During a news conference, President Barack Obama called on Americans to make gun legislation a priority for politicians on both sides of the aisle.

""This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America,"" he said, visibly angry, noting that speaking to the nation from the White House following a shooting had become a grim ritual of his presidency.

Word of the shooting spread swiftly through the rural region near the banks of the North Umpqua River -- as locals waited for word of the dead and wounded.

Gavin Bell, a student at the school, said he was sitting in the library, next door to the building where the shooting took place, when several students burst in, shouting for people to call 911. School officials rushed into the library and told students there was an active shooter on campus.

Mr. Bell said he and 20 other students hid in a bathroom until police told them it was safe to leave. ""We didn't hear any shots. But everyone was pretty nervous,"" he said.

Mr. Bell said a student told him she was sitting in class when gunshots rang out. Her teacher opened the door and was immediately shot in the chest, he said she recounted.

Cristina Bayardo, a 21-year-old student, was in a science building next to Snyder Hall, where the shooting occurred.

""We heard something like a backfiring, like a car backfiring,"" she said. A professor came in and told them to head to the back of the classroom, because there was a possible shooting taking place, she said. ""We had no idea whether this was an actual active shooting or not until about 10 minutes later, an email popped up on the system at school and they said this is not a drill.""

""We keep thinking, we probably know the shooter,"" she said. ""The probability that you went to high school with this person, that you went to elementary school with this person or worked with this person is very, very high.""

Hannah Miles, a 19 year old student studying to be a registered nurse, said she was worrying about essay topics for a writing assignment when she heard shots fired in the classroom next to hers. Then they heard three more shots. Her teacher said, ""everybody out, we have to get out,"" and the students scattered.

Some, including Ms. Miles, ran toward the school bookstore, where they took cover in a back room with the doors locked and the lights off. ""And we were just sitting and crouching and we're hugging each other and crying on each other's shoulders,"" she said. ""I just prayed the whole time.""

Dr. Rita Cavin, president of the college, said the campus had a no-gun policy, and just last week trained for a shooting emergency. ""It is a tragedy, and it's an anomaly,"" she said. ""We have a beautiful, warm, friendly, loving campus.""

The wounded were taken to Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg. The PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend, a hospital in Springfield, Ore., said it had received three patients, all women between ages 18 and 34.

The college, whose oak tree- lined campus is located about 6 miles outside of Roseburg, has about 3,000 full time students and 16,000 part-time students.

Donna Spicer, an adjunct music professor, hadn't gone to work on Thursday, but was frantically reaching out to fellow teachers to make sure they were OK and waited to hear if her students were safe. ""Your heart just goes out, hoping your students are OK,"" she said.

Ms. Spicer said she had been a teacher at Roseburg High School a decade ago when a student shot and wounded a fellow classmate, an event that many people in town referenced on Thursday.

But the violence that occurred at the college on Thursday was still unusual for this scenic pocket of Oregon. Ms. Spicer said the school had only one, unarmed security guard.

The mass shooting comes as Oregon recently has taken steps to tighten its gun laws.

In May, Gov. Brown signed into law a bill requiring background checks on private gun sales, like those set up through online communications.

The law, which took effect in August, subjects those sales to the same mental-health and criminal checks required by federal law at retail outlets nationwide. The majority of states don't require background checks on private sales.

In June, Gov. Brown signed into law a separate bill that gives local law enforcement the right to take guns from those convicted of certain misdemeanor crimes involving domestic violence.

Still, there are gun-friendly elements to Oregon's laws. For instance, the state doesn't ban the transfer or sale of semi-automatic weapons or other large-capacity ammunition magazines. It also specifically doesn't allow its cities or counties to regulate guns.

And Oregon is one of a small number of states that forces colleges to allow guns on public university campuses, at least in some circumstances. A 2011 court case found that state law prevented the legislature from establishing rules prohibiting guns throughout state college campuses.

A law enforcement official said it didn't appear that Mr. Mercer had committed any criminal offenses in the past that would have prohibited him from buying guns.
","A 26-year-old man opened fire on a community college campus here in a rampage that left 10 people dead and seven wounded and turned this rural stretch of southern Oregon into the latest American locale ravaged by a mass shooting.

Students described scenes of carnage concentrated in a public speaking class that was underway in a college humanities building, and people fleeing in panic from classrooms as they heard shots nearby.

The college, Umpqua Community College, went into lockdown, and the gunman died in an exchange of gunfire with police officers who responded, law enforcement officials said.

With anxious parents waiting at a fairground near the campus and the police going from classroom to classroom, the authorities' reports of the death toll varied throughout the day. At a 5 p.m. news conference, John Hanlin, the sheriff of Douglas County, said that he believed there were 10 dead, calling the toll the ""best, most accurate information we have at this time."" He declined to say whether the gunman was included in the death toll.

Law enforcement officials identified the gunman Thursday night as Chris Harper Mercer, and said he had three weapons, at least one of them a long gun and the other ones handguns. It was not clear whether he fired them all. The officials said the man lived in the Roseburg area.

They said one witness had told them that Mr. Mercer had asked about people's religions before he began firing. ""He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,"" one law enforcement official said. Investigators are poring over what one official described as ""hateful"" writings by Mr. Mercer. The F.B.I. has dispatched dozens of agents to assist in the investigation.

Sheriff Hanlin said at a news conference that he would not speak the gunman's name.

""Let me be very clear, I will not name the shooter,"" he said. ""I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act.""

He also encouraged reporters ""not to glorify and create sensationalism for him. He in no way deserves it.""

The massacre added the community college to a string of schools that have been left grieving after mass shootings, a list that runs from Columbine High School in 1999 to Virginia Tech in 2007 to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children were killed in 2012.

President Obama, in an impassioned appearance at the White House, said that grief was not enough, and he implored Americans, ""whether they are Democrats or Republicans or independents,"" to consider their representatives' stance on gun control when they voted and to decide ""whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor.""

State and local officials all expressed shock. Gov. Kate Brown said at a news conference that she felt ""profound dismay and heartbreak.""

The first reports of shots came at 10:38 a.m. on what was the fourth day of the new session. Students said they took place in Classroom 15 in a building called Snyder that houses many English and writing classes.

Cassandra Welding, a 20-year-old junior, was in Classroom 16, next to the shooting, and heard several loud bursts, like balloons popping. There were about 20 people in the classroom. A middle-aged woman behind her rose to shut the classroom door and was struck in the stomach by several bullets.

""He was just out there, hanging outside the door,"" Ms. Welding said of the gunman, ""and she slumped over and I knew something wasn't right. And they're like, 'She got shot, she got shot.' And everyone is panicking.""

A friend of the injured woman dragged her into the room and began delivering CPR, Ms. Welding said. Someone clicked the door shut and the students huddled in the corner, blocking themselves with desks and backpacks. ""I heard more shooting,"" Ms. Welding said. ""It was horrific. My whole body was shaking. A chill was going down my spine. We called 911.""

She added, ""I was on the phone with my mom pretty much the entire time. I knew this could have been the last time I talked to her.""

Brady Winder, 23, who moved to Roseburg only three weeks ago, was in a writing class.

""We heard one shot,"" Mr. Winder said. ""It sounded like someone dropped something heavy on the floor, and everybody kind of startled. There's a door connecting our classroom to that classroom, and my teacher was going to knock on the door, but she called out, 'Is everybody O.K.?' And then we heard a bunch more shots. We all froze for about half a second. Everybody's head turned and looked at each other, trying to just grasp what was happening, and someone said, 'Those are gunshots.' We heard people screaming next door. And then everybody took off. People were hopping over desks, knocking things over.""

Kortney Moore, 18, from Rogue River, told the Roseburg newspaper, The News-Review, that the gunman had asked people to stand up and state their religion and then started firing. She said she saw her teacher shot in the head, adding that she herself was on the floor with people who had been shot.

Federal law enforcement officials said they were examining an online conversation on 4chan, an anonymous message board, as well as other social media, trying to determine whether any of it was linked to the gunman. In that conversation, one writer said, ""Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the Northwest.""

Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland, with a population of 22,000, is a part of the Pacific Northwest that in many ways has been left behind as the region has moved on toward an economy of technology and high wages. Once a major center for wood milling, it has struggled in recent decades as the timber harvests in the national forests that hug the community have declined.

Wine grape cultivation has helped some, but poverty and unemployment rates are high. In August, according to the most recent government figures, Douglas County had an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent, tied for the second-highest in the state. About 20 percent of residents in the city and county live below the federal poverty line.

The college, with about 3,000 students, reflects that struggle, with many of its students coming back to school to gain skills for a career change. The average student is 37, and popular courses of study include winemaking, nursing, welding and auto mechanics. ""It's a community college, so a lot of our friends and family attend this college,"" Sheriff Hanlin said.

Joe Olson, who retired as president of Umpqua Community College at the end of June, said that within the past several months, the college had discussed hiring an armed security guard, but had ultimately decided against it.

""We talked about that over the last year because we were concerned about safety on campus,"" he said. ""The campus was split 50-50. We thought we were a very safe campus, and having armed security officers on campus might change the culture.""

He added, though, that he did not believe a security guard could prevent a gunman determined to kill.

""If you want to come on the campus and you want to shoot five people, you are going to do that before our security would arrive,"" he said.

Oregon is one of seven states with provisions, either from state legislation or court rulings, that allow the carrying of concealed weapons on public postsecondary campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The other states are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah and Wisconsin.

Numerous law enforcement agencies responded to Thursday's shooting. Corey Ray, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the agency was sending teams, including canine teams, from Seattle, Portland and Eugene, Ore. They will join a team already on the ground that is helping search for firearms casings and other ammunition.

The apartment complex where the gunman had lived was roped off with police tape and under guard by deputies last night. Bronte Hart, 21, said she lived beneath Mr. Mercer, who she said would frequently shout at her for smoking on her balcony.

""He yelled at us, me and my husband,"" said Ms. Hart, who lives in the complex with her husband and father. ""He was not a friendly type of guy. He did not want anything to do with anyone.""

Ms. Hart and her father, Eli Loomas, said the authorities had shown up at the complex in the morning and begun asking questions about Mr. Mercer.

Eight miles south of the college, at a cordoned-off hall on the Douglas County Fairgrounds, family members spent agonizing hours waiting to hear of possible victims as students were evacuated there.

""The police searched everybody,"" Mr. Winder, one of the students, said, ""searching their jackets and bags for weapons before putting them on buses.""

Among those waiting were Jessica Chandler, whose daughter, 18-year-old Rebecka Carnes, started classes at Umpqua on Monday. Her daughter, an aspiring dental hygienist, had not responded to dozens of calls. A friend told Ms. Chandler that the teenager had been taken to a hospital, but the police and hospital officials would not confirm it.

""She always has her cellphone and is always in contact,"" Ms. Chandler said, smoking a cigarette outside the family waiting area. ""I want to know where my kid is.""

Many students at the school talked about tiny details that stuck with them as they ran, and how they had tried to piece together information as they hid and hoped to stay alive.

Joanah Fallin was headed toward the campus around 10:30 a.m. when he saw a police car go by at what, he estimated, was 120 miles an hour. ""I've never seen any car go that fast,"" he said.

By the time he reached campus, it was already in mayhem. ""Lot of people were crying,"" he said. ""There was a woman with a child. It was just unbelievable.""

Luke Rogers, another student, was in the building next door to the shooting. He said he and his classmates were locked in the building from 10:30 a.m. until noon, with the only access to information about the shooting coming from texts from friends and family.

""When we exited the building, the officers made us put our hands above our heads and leave in a single-file line,"" he said. ""As we passed Snyder hall, we saw the doors open, and on the ground there were drops of blood.""

88,88,2015-11-14-ParisTerrorsim.txt,"Good evening, everybody.  I just want to make a few brief comments about the attacks across Paris tonight.  Once again, weâve seen an outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians.

This is an attack not just on Paris, itâs an attack not just on the people of France, but this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share.

We stand prepared and ready to provide whatever assistance that the government and the people of France need to respond.  France is our oldest ally.  The French people have stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States time and again.  And we want to be very clear that we stand together with them in the fight against terrorism and extremism.

Paris itself represents the timeless values of human progress.  Those who think that they can terrorize the people of France or the values that they stand for are wrong.  The American people draw strength from the French peopleâs commitment to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.

We are reminded in this time of tragedy that the bonds of libertÃ© and Ã©galitÃ© and fraternitÃ© are not only values that the French people care so deeply about, but they are values that we share.  And those values are going to endure far beyond any act of terrorism or the hateful vision of those who perpetrated the crimes this evening.

Weâre going to do whatever it takes to work with the French people and with nations around the world to bring these terrorists to justice, and to go after any terrorist networks that go after our people.

We donât yet know all the details of what has happened.  We have been in contact with French officials to communicate our deepest condolences to the families of those who have been killed, to offer our prayers and thoughts to those who have been wounded.  We have offered our full support to them.

The situation is still unfolding.  Iâve chosen not to call President Hollande at this time, because my expectation is that heâs very busy at the moment.  I actually, by coincidence, was talking to him earlier today in preparation for the G20 meeting.  But I am confident that Iâll be in direct communications with him in the next few days, and weâll be coordinating in any ways that they think are helpful in the investigation of whatâs happened.

This is a heartbreaking situation.  And obviously those of us here in the United States know what itâs like.  Weâve gone through these kinds of episodes ourselves.  And whenever these kinds of attacks happened, weâve always been able to count on the French people to stand with us.  They have been an extraordinary counterterrorism partner, and we intend to be there with them in that same fashion.

Iâm sure that in the days ahead weâll learn more about exactly what happened, and my teams will make sure that we are in communication with the press to provide you accurate information.  I donât want to speculate at this point in terms of who was responsible for this.  It appears that there may still be live activity and dangers that are taking place as we speak.  And so until we know from French officials that the situation is under control, and we have for more information about it, I donât want to speculate.

Okay? Thank you very much.
","Terror swept the French capital late Friday as six separate attacks -- in a bustling nightlife district and outside a soccer stadium -- left more than 100 people dead in one of the bloodiest assaults in the country's history.

The sheer scale of the mayhem left authorities reeling. The government declared a state of emergency, sending military forces onto the streets of Paris, sealing off roads and reinstating border controls. Sirens blared across the city as police and emergency workers rushed to respond.

Authorities said early Saturday they believed all the attackers were dead. Yet the seemingly coordinated attacks left France's intelligence and security services facing one of their worst-nightmare scenarios: several armed groups moving undetected and wreaking havoc simultaneously.

""An unprecedented terrorist attack is under way,"" President Francois Hollande said in a televised address shortly after he himself had been evacuated from the soccer stadium. ""This is a horror.""

As a precaution, police urged Parisians to stay home and avoid outdoor public events. The Paris prosecutor's office said there could be more than 120 deaths in all, and that five ""terrorists"" had been ""neutralized.""

The highest death toll was at the Bataclan, a popular concert venue. Police estimates ranged from around 80 to more than 100, with dozens injured.

Two gunmen began mowing down spectators, taking others hostage before they blew themselves up using explosive belts when police moved in, authorities said.

Four people were killed as police took control of the building, police said; it wasn't clear if that included the attackers.

""It seems unreal. We saw bodies falling from the balconies,"" said another woman who was inside the Bataclan, speaking on BFM television. ""They said nothing except that it's Francois Hollande's fault that they wanted to kill us all.""

Mr. Hollande later visited the scene, where he promised to fight back. ""We're going into battle. We will be pitiless,"" he said.

Another 38 people were killed in five separate shootings in the 10th and 11th arrondissements, according to Paris' chief prosecutor Francois Molins. The area to the east and south of Place de la Republique is typically thronged with diners and partygoers on a Friday night.

The head of police in Paris said gunmen walked down the streets, shooting at people in cafes and restaurants.

Other attackers set off at least two explosions outside the Stade de France soccer stadium, where a large crowd, including Mr. Hollande, had gathered to watch the French and German national teams play. Play continued but spectators later streamed onto the field and out the exits.

Place de la Republique is also near the scene of the January attack on the former offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, part of an assault that left 17 dead. Those perpetrators claimed allegiance to Islamic State and an al Qaeda affiliate.

It was unclear who was behind Friday's attacks. France has joined the U.S.-led air campaign against Islamic State territory in Iraq and Syria, stirring vows of retaliation from the militant group.

Friday's assault puts U.S. security officials on edge. Authorities in New York increased the police presence at sensitive sites in what they called a precautionary measure that wasn't based on any specific intelligence.

Within an hour of the first sketchy but horrific-sounding details, President Barack Obama had been briefed by national security officials and minutes afterward made nationally televised remarks, branding the attacks a terrorist act and vowing U.S. assistance.

The attacks weren't just on Paris but ""on all humanity,"" Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House.

""We're going to do whatever it takes to work with the French people and with nations around the world to bring these terrorists to justice and to go after any terrorist networks that go after our people,"" Mr. Obama said.

Buildings around the world were lit up in France's tricolors in honor of the dead. The World Trade Center's spire, San Francisco's City Hall and Toronto's CN Tower all tweeted photos. The Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas went dark.

France is weeks away from hosting an international summit on climate change, with more than 100 heads of states and governments expected to attend.

Mr. Obama spoke about the attacks just ahead of his trip to the Group of 20 summit in Turkey, where the fight against Islamic State and the crisis in Syria will be high on the agenda.

Mr. Hollande was also scheduled to attend the G-20 summit, but called off his trip after the attacks, sending two ministers in his place.

The early reports of the Paris violence suggested a degree of sophistication and coordination not seen even in the earlier Paris terrorist attack in January carried out by supporters of the Islamic State terror group.

The apparent use of explosives Friday night, and the likelihood that a significant number of terrorist operatives were required to carry out the seemingly coordinated attacks, were particularly alarming to U.S. counterterrorism officials, because it suggested that the operational capability and threat posed by would-be terrorists was expanding.

After the January attacks on Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery store, French counter-terrorism officials had warned the country was ill-equipped to deter the new breed of AK-47-wielding gunmen who in recent months have struck not only in Paris, but in Brussels, Copenhagen and the capitals of Mali and Tunisia.

At the time, the French government responded by demanding new powers to upgrade its spycraft capabilities, mainly on Internet and telecoms networks. Following Friday's carnage, however, counter-terrorism officials may now request a bigger hammer to combat terror groups, which may force the French government to contemplate further restrictions in civil liberties.


","The night was chilly but thick with excitement as the big match between France's national soccer team and archrival Germany was underway at the national stadium in a northern suburb of Paris. President FranÃ§ois Hollande watched with the crowd as the French players pushed the ball across midfield.

Then came the sharp, unmistakable crack of an explosion, overwhelming the roar of the crowd. A stunned moment passed. Players and spectators seemed confused, and eventually the awful realization swept through the stadium: Terror, for the second time this year, had struck Paris.

The symmetry could not be more jarring. A Parisian year that began with the bloodshed and chaos of the terrorist attacks at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and later at a Jewish grocery now had an even deadlier coda: With events still fluid and exact details unclear, the authorities said more than 100 people had been killed in a series of attacks across Paris. And dozens of people were taken hostage at a Parisian theater.

The urgent, bleating screech of sirens filled the evening air as police cruisers raced through the streets, uncertain if more mayhem was to come. Taxis ferried people home without charge as the police advised residents to stay inside. Ambulances screamed down the boulevards, as a stunned and confused French capital was again left to wonder: Why us? Once again?

""Paris has been hit again by terror tonight,"" Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman said on Twitter.

For three days in January, Paris was gripped with fear as the police searched for ChÃ©rif and SaÃ¯d Kouachi after the two brothers attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices, a manhunt that ended with the Kouachis dying in a shootout. The terror only deepened when a third terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, attacked a Jewish grocery, killing customers, before the police stormed the building and killed him.

Those attacks left France reeling for months, dredging up sadness and fury and horror. They also stirred a national debate over freedom of expression and the state of French Islam, a topic that has divided France like few others and seems certain to intensify now.

The attackers' names, or whether they are linked to radical Islamist groups, are not yet known. But some witnesses described militants shouting ""God is great"" in Arabic before opening fire.

France was already in a foul temper, with the economy stagnant and far-right politicians stoking anti-immigrant sentiment, especially Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front. Ms. Le Pen has mocked Mr. Hollande as weak and stirred French nationalism by vowing to close borders. With regional elections scheduled for Dec. 16, Ms. Le Pen seems certain to keep rising in the polls.

""Of course Le Pen is going to capitalize on this,"" said Laurence Bagot, 45, a French entrepreneur. ""She has already been using rhetoric like closing borders and increasing national security. Now that's actually happening.""

The French authorities, sharply criticized for failing to monitor the homegrown jihadists who had been known to security officials, vowed to tighten scrutiny of suspected terror cells and protect the country. Ms. Bagot said the attacks seemed to occur after French security was lowered months after the Charlie Hebdo attacks.

""It feels like we've created a monster, where the terrorists know better than our own security forces how to maneuver,"" she said. ""These people are agile, young, have no morals and no limits.""

On Friday night, the usual Parisian reverie was replaced by chaos.

At the Stade de France, spectators described a sense of panic as the explosions shook the stadium and quickly undermined whatever confidence had returned in the months since the attack on the magazine.

""Of course I'm afraid for the future,"" said Tony Vandelle, 31, who attended the France-Germany match with his brother. ""With all the strikes in Syria, we're not safe anymore.""

""Already France was traumatized when Charlie Hebdo happened, including our children, who still talk about it at school,"" he added. ""This is taking things to another level. To see something like this again so soon is frightening for the future.""

Karim Laruelle and his brother, Smaen, described hearing three explosions. ""It sounded like firecrackers,"" Karim Laruelle said. ""We did not really know what was happening until we started getting texts from our families telling us the shootings had happened elsewhere in Paris.

""They wanted to know if we were safe.""

It was a question that resonated in every corner of the city. At the junction of Folie-MÃ©ricourt and Oberkampf, roughly 150 yards from the Bataclan theater, where a rock concert had become a hostage scene, the sound of shooting echoed from the direction of the theater: single shots followed by automatic fire and a series of loud bangs.

Besides the assaults at the Bataclan and the stadium, the attackers chose several of Paris's busiest night life streets and intersections, including the Boulevard Voltaire, the Boulevard Beaumarchais and the Rue de Charonne.

A man calling himself Leo, who lives near the Rue de Charonne, told Europe 1, a radio network, that his wife was among the first to help victims near the Petit Cambodge restaurant -- describing the scene as a ""massacre"" and ""apocalyptic.""

His wife told him that bodies were ""littered on the ground.""

At the Bataclan, a reporter named Julien Pearce told Europe 1 that two men entered the theater with guns blazing.

""The men shot at the audience, which lasted for about 10 minutes, with one shot lasting three or four seconds,"" he said. ""They shot, recharged their guns, and shot again, even aiming at those already lying on the ground. I saw about 10 bodies lying on the ground, but couldn't tell whether they were injured or dead.""

The day had begun with ominous warnings: bomb threats at the German soccer team's hotel and at Gare de Lyon, one of the city's train stations. Trains coming into the station were halted or rerouted as officers combed the building for explosives. The hotel was also searched. Time passed.

Then the police reopened the station. It was a bomb scare. They happen fairly often in Paris. The city resumed its rhythms, unaware of what was to come.

89,89,2015-12-14-ParisAccords.txt,"Good evening. In my first Inaugural Address, I committed this country to the tireless task of combating climate change and protecting this planet for future generations. 

Two weeks ago, in Paris, I said before the world that we needed a strong global agreement to accomplish this goal -- an enduring agreement that reduces global carbon pollution and sets the world on a course to a low-carbon future. 

A few hours ago, we succeeded.  We came together around the strong agreement the world needed.  We met the moment.

I want to commend President Hollande and Secretary General Ban for their leadership and for hosting such a successful summit, and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius for presiding with patience and resolve.  And I want to give a special thanks to Secretary John Kerry, my Senior Advisor Brian Deese, our chief negotiator Todd Stern, and everyone on their teams for their outstanding work and for making America proud.

I also want to thank the people of nearly 200 nations -- large and small, developed and developing -- for working together to confront a threat to the people of all nations.  Together, weâve shown whatâs possible when the world stands as one.

Today, the American people can be proud -- because this historic agreement is a tribute to American leadership.  Over the past seven years, weâve transformed the United States into the global leader in fighting climate change.  In 2009, we helped salvage a chaotic Copenhagen Summit and established the principle that all countries had a role to play in combating climate change.  We then led by example, with historic investments in growing industries like wind and solar, creating a new and steady stream of middle-class jobs.  Weâve set the first-ever nationwide standards to limit the amount of carbon pollution power plants can dump into the air our children breathe.  From Alaska to the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains, weâve partnered with local leaders who are working to help their communities protect themselves from some of the most immediate impacts of a changing climate.   

Now, skeptics said these actions would kill jobs.  Instead, weâve seen the longest streak of private-sector job creation in our history.  Weâve driven our economic output to all-time highs while driving our carbon pollution down to its lowest level in nearly two decades.  And then, with our historic joint announcement with China last year, we showed it was possible to bridge the old divides between developed and developing nations that had stymied global progress for so long.  That accomplishment encouraged dozens and dozens of other nations to set their own ambitious climate targets.  And that was the foundation for success in Paris.  Because no nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this challenge alone.  And no country, no matter how small, can sit on the sidelines.  All of us had to solve it together. 

Now, no agreement is perfect, including this one.  Negotiations that involve nearly 200 nations are always challenging.  Even if all the initial targets set in Paris are met, weâll only be part of the way there when it comes to reducing carbon from the atmosphere.  So we cannot be complacent because of todayâs agreement.  The problem is not solved because of this accord.  But make no mistake, the Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis.  It creates the mechanism, the architecture, for us to continually tackle this problem in an effective way.   

This agreement is ambitious, with every nation setting and committing to their own specific targets, even as we take into account differences among nations.  Weâll have a strong system of transparency, including periodic reviews and independent assessments, to help hold every country accountable for meeting its commitments.  As technology advances, this agreement allows progress to pave the way for even more ambitious targets over time.  And we have secured a broader commitment to support the most vulnerable countries as they pursue cleaner economic growth.

In short, this agreement will mean less of the carbon pollution that threatens our planet, and more of the jobs and economic growth driven by low-carbon investment.  Full implementation of this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change, and will pave the way for even more progress, in successive stages, over the coming years.

Moreover, this agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is firmly committed to a low-carbon future.  And that has the potential to unleash investment and innovation in clean energy at a scale we have never seen before.  The targets weâve set are bold.  And by empowering businesses, scientists, engineers, workers, and the private sector -- investors -- to work together, this agreement represents the best chance weâve had to save the one planet that weâve got. 

So I believe this moment can be a turning point for the world.  Weâve shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge.  It wonât be easy.  Progress wonât always come quick.  We cannot be complacent.  While our generation will see some of the benefits of building a clean energy economy -- jobs created and money saved -- we may not live to see the full realization of our achievement.  But thatâs okay.  What matters is that today we can be more confident that this planet is going to be in better shape for the next generation.  And thatâs what I care about.  I imagine taking my grandkids, if Iâm lucky enough to have some, to the park someday, and holding their hands, and hearing their laughter, and watching a quiet sunset, all the while knowing that our work today prevented an alternate future that could have been grim; that our work, here and now, gave future generations cleaner air, and cleaner water, and a more sustainable planet.  And what could be more important than that?

Today, thanks to strong, principled, American leadership, thatâs the world that weâll leave to our children -- a world that is safer and more secure, more prosperous, and more free.  And that is our most important mission in our short time here on this Earth. 

Thanks.
","The landmark climate agreement that more than 190 countries struck in Paris over the weekend ushers in a broad, new international effort to wind down the fossil-fuel era.

But as two weeks of tumultuous negotiations made clear, the pact's success hinges on individual countries making painful choices -- especially in how they produce and consume energy -- that could profoundly shape corporate behavior, financial markets and the global economic landscape.

Paul Polman, chief executive of European-based consumer-goods giant Unilever PLC and an outspoken environmental advocate, said the deal sent an ""unequivocal signal to the business and financial communities, one that will drive real change in the real economy.""

Others, especially from the fossil-fuel industry and some U.S. companies, were more critical or played down the impact of the agreement. Stephen Eule, vice president for climate and technology at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbies Washington lawmakers on behalf of large U.S. companies, said the deal risks damaging the U.S. economy by pushing the country toward more costly energy from renewable sources.

""The Paris climate conference delivered more of the same -- lots of promises and lots of issues still left unresolved,"" he said. ""The White House's overall domestic strategy of making energy more expensive and less abundant to satisfy international constituencies, many of whom compete against the United States, should worry the business community, American workers and consumers.""

Supporters hope the deal will unleash an avalanche of financing and investment from entrepreneurs, companies and international lenders into renewable energy sources, technologies such as electric cars and new ways to capture and store gasses from carbon-intensive fuels such as coal.

Still, Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, an industry advocate, said the agreement left room for the coal industry to grow, especially with renewed financing for carbon capture and storage to stop emissions from being released into the atmosphere.

At the core of the agreement, reached Saturday evening in a suburb of Paris, is a collection of voluntary plans submitted by every country to tackle climate change, each reflecting its own economic and political situation. Most of them focus on shifting to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and, for some, nuclear power and away from carbon-heavy fuels such as coal and oil.

While the plans lay out a monumental challenge, in aggregate they still don't meet the level of cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions that the agreement itself targets. Much of the success of the deal also lies in implementation years from now, by governments that haven't yet been elected. The accord's requirement to review the ambition of the planned cuts to emissions provides what supporters hope will be an open-ended commitment to deeper cuts.

The plans aren't legally enforceable -- a condition the U.S. among others insisted upon -- though the deal does legally bind countries to a periodic review process that backers of the accord hope will prod countries to repeatedly raise their emissions-cutting efforts.

In addition, developed countries have to help provide at least $100 billion annually from a variety of sources after 2020 to help developing countries cut their emissions.

Getting to that agreement was a bumpy path and an outcome that surprised many participants and observers as ambitions in the negotiating rooms grew. A key alliance that sprang up was among a group of small developing nations led by the tiny Marshall Islands, along with Mexico and Colombia -- and the European Union. All wanted a tough agreement that wasn't only legally binding but also aimed for a more aggressive target in curbing the rise in average global temperatures.

The conference's stated goal was to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The islands wanted a goal of 1.5 degrees, arguing that aiming for the 2-degree target wouldn't be enough to prevent them from being wiped out by rising sea levels, based on most scientific forecasts.

While the U.S. wasn't willing to go that far, it soon joined forces with the alliance, offering to join their calls for a more ambitious target in exchange for acknowledgment that developed nations wouldn't take on the liability for the damage to poor countries caused by rising sea levels and more frequent, more intense storms.

One U.S. demand shaped the conference before it even began: In a divided Washington, Republicans who control Congress vowed to reject anything the Democratic Obama administration sent there for approval. For Todd Stern, who headed the U.S. negotiating team in Paris, that ruled out any legally binding commitment to cut emissions, a major goal of the Europeans and some other countries.

That large caveat thrust a top State Department lawyer into the center of the fray. Susan Biniaz was the arbiter on the critical matter of what would or wouldn't require U.S. congressional authorization during the talks.

The differences were settled in the night between Friday and Saturday, when developed countries agreed to continue leading on financing, leaving large emerging markets like China free to make just voluntary contributions. In return, developing countries accepted regular reviews and checks of their voluntary plans to curb emissions.
","With the sudden bang of a gavel Saturday night, representatives of 195 nations reached a landmark accord that will, for the first time, commit nearly every country to lowering planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to help stave off the most drastic effects of climate change.

The deal, which was met with an eruption of cheers and ovations from thousands of delegates gathered from around the world, represents a historic breakthrough on an issue that has foiled decades of international efforts to address climate change.

Traditionally, such pacts have required developed economies like the United States to take action to lower greenhouse gas emissions, but they have exempted developing countries like China and India from such obligations.

The accord, which United Nations diplomats have been working toward for nine years, changes that dynamic by requiring action in some form from every country, rich or poor.

""This is truly a historic moment,"" the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said in an interview. ""For the first time, we have a truly universal agreement on climate change, one of the most crucial problems on earth.""

President Obama, who regards tackling climate change as a central element of his legacy, spoke of the deal in a televised address from the White House. ""This agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is fully committed to a low-carbon future,"" he said. ""We've shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge.""

Scientists and leaders said the talks here represented the world's last, best hope of striking a deal that would begin to avert the most devastating effects of a warming planet.

Mr. Ban said there was ""no Plan B"" if the deal fell apart. The Eiffel Tower was illuminated with that phrase Friday night.

The new deal will not, on its own, solve global warming. At best, scientists who have analyzed it say, it will cut global greenhouse gas emissions by about half enough as is necessary to stave off an increase in atmospheric temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That is the point at which, scientific studies have concluded, the world will be locked into a future of devastating consequences, including rising sea levels, severe droughts and flooding, widespread food and water shortages and more destructive storms.

But the Paris deal could represent the moment at which, because of a shift in global economic policy, the inexorable rise in planet-warming carbon emissions that started during the Industrial Revolution began to level out and eventually decline.

At the same time, the deal could be viewed as a signal to global financial and energy markets, triggering a fundamental shift away from investment in coal, oil and gas as primary energy sources toward zero-carbon energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear power.

""The world finally has a framework for cooperating on climate change that's suited to the task,"" said Michael Levi, an expert on energy and climate change policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Whether or not this becomes a true turning point for the world, though, depends critically on how seriously countries follow through.""

Just five years ago, such a deal seemed politically impossible. A similar 2009 climate change summit meeting in Copenhagen collapsed in acrimonious failure after countries could not unite around a deal.

Unlike in Copenhagen, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius of France said on Saturday, the stars for this assembly were aligned.

The changes that led to the Paris accord came about through a mix of factors, particularly major shifts in the domestic politics and bilateral relationships of China and the United States, the world's two largest greenhouse gas polluters.

Since the Copenhagen deal collapsed, scientific studies have confirmed that the earliest impacts of climate change have started to sweep across the planet. While scientists once warned that climate change was a problem for future generations, recent scientific reports have concluded that it has started to wreak havoc now, from flooding in Miami to droughts and water shortages in China.

In a remarkable shift from their previous standoffs over the issue, senior officials from both the United States and China praised the Paris accord on Saturday night.

Secretary of State John Kerry, who has spent the past year negotiating behind the scenes with his Chinese and Indian counterparts in order to help broker the deal, said, ""The world has come together around an agreement that will empower us to chart a new path for our planet.""

Xie Zhenhua, the senior Chinese climate change negotiator, said, ""The agreement is not perfect, and there are some areas in need of improvement."" But he added, ""This does not prevent us from marching forward with this historic step."" Mr. Xie called the deal ""fair and just, comprehensive and balanced, highly ambitious, enduring and effective.""

Negotiators from many countries have said that a crucial moment in the path to the Paris accord came last year in the United States, when Mr. Obama enacted the nation's first climate change policy -- a set of stringent new Environmental Protection Agency regulations designed to slash greenhouse gas pollution from the nation's coal-fired power plants. Meanwhile, in China, the growing internal criticism over air pollution from coal-fired power plants led President Xi Jinping to pursue domestic policies to cut coal use.

In November 2014 in Beijing, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi announced that they would jointly pursue plans to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions. That breakthrough announcement was seen as paving the way to the Paris deal, in which nearly all the world's nations have jointly announced similar plans.

The final language did not fully satisfy everyone. Representatives of some developing nations expressed consternation. Poorer countries had pushed for a legally binding provision requiring that rich countries appropriate a minimum of at least $100 billion a year to help them mitigate and adapt to the ravages of climate change. In the final deal, that $100 billion figure appears only in a preamble, not in the legally binding portion of the agreement.

""We've always said that it was important that the $100 billion was anchored in the agreement,"" said Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, a negotiator for the Democratic Republic of Congo and the incoming leader of a coalition known as the Least Developed Countries coalition. In the end, though, they let it go.

Despite the historic nature of the Paris climate accord, its success still depends heavily on two factors outside the parameter of the deal: global peer pressure and the actions of future governments.

The core of the Paris deal is a requirement that every nation take part. Ahead of the Paris talks, governments of 186 nations put forth public plans detailing how they would cut carbon emissions through 2025 or 2030.

Those plans alone, once enacted, will cut emissions by half the levels required to stave off the worst effects of global warming. The national plans vary vastly in scope and ambition -- while every country is required to put forward a plan, there is no legal requirement dictating how, or how much, countries should cut emissions.

Thus, the Paris pact has built in a series of legally binding requirements that countries ratchet up the stringency of their climate change policies in the future. Countries will be required to reconvene every five years, starting in 2020, with updated plans that would tighten their emissions cuts.

Countries will also be legally required to reconvene every five years starting in 2023 to publicly report on how they are doing in cutting emissions compared to their plans. They will be legally required to monitor and report on their emissions levels and reductions, using a universal accounting system.

That hybrid legal structure was explicitly designed in response to the political reality in the United States. A deal that would have assigned legal requirements for countries to cut emissions at specific levels would need to go before the United States Senate for ratification. That language would have been dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, where many members question the established science of human-caused climate change, and still more wish to thwart Mr. Obama's climate change agenda.

So the individual countries' plans are voluntary, but the legal requirements that they publicly monitor, verify and report what they are doing, as well as publicly put forth updated plans, are designed to create a ""name-and-shame"" system of global peer pressure, in hopes that countries will not want to be seen as international laggards.

That system depends heavily on the views of the future world leaders who will carry out those policies. In the United States, every Republican candidate running for president in 2016 has publicly questioned or denied the science of climate change, and has voiced opposition to Mr. Obama's climate change policies.

In the Senate, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, who has led the charge against Mr. Obama's climate change agenda, said, ""Before his international partners pop the champagne, they should remember that this is an unattainable deal based on a domestic energy plan that is likely illegal, that half the states have sued to halt, and that Congress has already voted to reject.""

There were few of those concerns at the makeshift negotiations center here in this suburb north of Paris. The delegates rose to their feet in applause to thank the French delegation, which drew on the finest elements of the country's longstanding traditions of diplomacy to broker a deal that was acceptable to all sides.

France's European partners recalled the coordinated Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people and threatened to cast a shadow over the negotiations. But, bound by a collective good will toward France, countries redoubled their efforts.

""This demonstrates the strength of the French nation and makes us Europeans all proud of the French nation,"" said Miguel Arias CaÃ±ete, the European Union's commissioner for energy and climate action.

Yet amid the spirit of success that dominated the final hours of the negotiations, Mr. Arias CaÃ±ete reminded delegates that the accord was the beginning of the real work. ""Today, we celebrate,"" he said. ""Tomorrow, we have to act. This is what the world expects of us.""

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the approval of a landmark climate accord by 193 nations misstated, in some editions, part of the name of the agency that employs Michael Levi, an energy expert, who said, ""The world finally has a framework for cooperating on climate change that's suited to the task."" The agency is the Council on Foreign Relations, not the Center on Foreign Relations.

90,90,2016-01-13-StateoftheUnion.txt," Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:

Tonight marks the eighth year that Iâve come here to report on the State of the Union.  And for this final one, Iâm going to try to make it shorter.  I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.

(I've been there. I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips.)

Now, I understand that because itâs an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low.  But Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.  So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities -- like criminal justice reform, and helping -- and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. So, who knows, we might just surprise the cynics again.

But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Donât worry, Iâve got plenty -- from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration system; protecting our kids from gun violence; equal pay for equal work; paid leave; raising the minimum wage. All these things -- All these things still matter to hardworking families. Theyâre still the right thing to do, and I wonât let up until they get done.

But for my final address to this chamber, I donât want to just talk about next year. I want to focus on the next five years, the next ten years, and beyond. I want to focus on our future. We live in a time of extraordinary change -- change thatâs reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. Itâs change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. Itâs change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.

America's been through big changes before -- wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future, who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to ""the dogmas of the quiet past.""

Instead we thought anew and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending Americaâs promise outward -- to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did, because we saw opportunity where there -- where others others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before. What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation, our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law -- these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.

In fact, itâs in that spirit that we have made the progress these past seven years. Thatâs how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. Thatâs how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector. Thatâs how -- Thatâs how we -- Thatâs how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans. Thatâs how we -- Thatâs -- Thatâs how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.

But -- But such progress is not inevitable. Itâs the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear -- turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, and the incredible things that we can do together?

So letâs talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress. First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? Second, how do we make technology work for us and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman? And finally, how can we make our politics reflect whatâs best in us, and not whatâs worst?

Let me start with the economy and a basic fact: The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. Weâre in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history -- more than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. Thatâs just part of a manufacturing surge thatâs created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And weâve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.

Anyone claiming that Americaâs economy is in decline is peddling fiction.

Now -- What is true, and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious, is that the economy has been changing in profound ways -- changes that started long before the Great Recession hit, changes that have not let up. Today, technology doesnât just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.

All these trends have squeezed workers -- even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing. Itâs made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are [sic] unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.

For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody. Weâve made progress, but we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that weâve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree. We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start. And together weâve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering.

In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and offering every student -- offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.

And -- And we have to make college affordable for every American. No hardworking student should be stuck in the red. Weâve already reduced student loan payments by -- to 10 percent of a borrowerâs income, and thatâs good. But now weâve actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and Iâm going to keep fighting to get that started this year. Itâs the right thing to do.

But a great education isnât all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. Itâs not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and a retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their 40s and 50s, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool; they may have to retrain; but they shouldnât loose what theyâve already worked so hard to build in the process.

Thatâs why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever. We shouldnât weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. Itâs about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business youâll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far, and in the process -- in the process health care inflation has slowed, our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.

Now, Iâm guessing we wonât agree on health care anytime soon. But -- (a little applause right there; just a guess) -- But there should be other ways parties can work together improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job, we shouldnât just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance. We should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business thatâs ready to hire him. If that new job doesnât pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if heâs going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. Thatâs the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.

I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up, and Iâd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support -- like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who donât have children.

But there are some areas where we just have to be honest: It has been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years, and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the systemâs not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And itâs an honest disagreement. And the American people have a choice to make. I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is red tape that needs to be cut.

(There you go. Yeah. See?)

But after years now of record corporate profits, working families wonât get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody elseâs expense. The middle -- Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collect -- collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis -- recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants arenât the principal reason wages havenât gone up. Those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. Itâs sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.

The point is, I believe, that in this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And Iâm not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses whoâve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders. And I want to spread those best practices across America. Thatâs part of a brighter future. In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.

And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?

Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didnât deny Sputnik was up there. We didnât argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later we were walking on the moon. Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better future.

Thatâs who we are. And over the past seven years, weâve nurtured that spirit. Weâve protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. Weâve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more.

You know, last year Vice President Biden said that, with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that theyâve had in over a decade. Well, so -- so tonight, Iâm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because heâs gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, Iâm putting Joe in charge of mission control. For the loved ones weâve all lost, for the families that we can still save, letâs make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.

(What do you think, Joe? Letâs make it happen.)

And medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You will be pretty lonely because youâll be debating our military, most of Americaâs business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree itâs a problem and intend to solve it.

But -- But even if -- even if the planet wasnât at stake, even if 2014 wasnât the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out to be even hotter -- why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?

Listen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results: In fields from Iowa to Texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal, in jobs that pay better than average.

Weâre taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy -- something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, weâve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth. Gas under two bucks a gallon ainât bad either.

Now weâve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we donât show them where the trends are going. And thatâs why Iâm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.

Now, none of this is going to happen overnight. And yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs weâll create, the money weâll save, the planet weâll preserve -- that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve; and itâs within our grasp.

Now, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world, and thatâs why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere thereâs a problem.

I told you earlier all the talk of Americaâs economic decline is political hot air. Well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me -- Let me tell you something: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth -- period. Period. Itâs not even close. Itâs not even close. Itâs not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know thatâs the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office. And when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead. They call us.

So itâs useful to level set here because when we donât we donât make good decisions. Now, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But thatâs not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and itâs certainly not because of diminished American strength.

In todayâs world, weâre threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria -- client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.

Itâs up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system; and to do that well it means that weâve got to set priorities. Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in todayâs world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country. Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out.

But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages -- they pose an enormous danger to civilians. They have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That -- That is the story ISIL wants to tell. Thatâs the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We donât need to build them up to show that weâre serious; and we sure donât need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the worldâs largest religions. We just need to call them what they are: killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.

And thatâs exactly what weâre doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISILâs financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we're taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, weâre taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. Weâre training, arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.

If this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. Take a vote. But the American people should know that, with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt Americaâs commitment -- or mine -- to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden. Ask -- Ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits.

Our foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it canât stop there. For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world -- in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America and Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite but it doesnât pass muster on the world stage.

We also canât try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis -- even if itâs done with the best of intentions. Thatâs not leadership; thatâs a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. Itâs the lesson of Vietnam. Itâs the lesson of Iraq -- and we should have learned it by now.

Now, fortunately there is a smarter approach -- a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us -- and make sure other countries pull their own weight. Thatâs our approach to conflicts like Syria, where weâre partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.

Thatâs why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran; and as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.

Thatâs how -- Thatâs how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, our development workers -- they were heroic. They set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands -- maybe [a] couple million -- lives were saved.

Thatâs how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, and protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region -- we do. You want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it. Itâs the right thing to do.

Let me give you another example: Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy. It set us back in Latin America. Thatâs why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.

The -- The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world, except when we kill terrorists, or, occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security -- not something separate, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, itâs the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.

You know, right now we're on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS -- thatâs within our grasp. And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria -- something Iâll be pushing this Congress to fund this year. Thatâs American strength. Thatâs American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That's why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It it expensive; it is unnecessary; and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. Thereâs a better way.

And thatâs why we need to reject any politics, any politics that targets people because of race or religion. Alright, let me just say this: This is not a matter of political correctness. This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.

His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot that Iâm standing on tonight -- that ""to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place."" When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad, or fellow citizens; when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesnât make us safer. Thatâs not telling it what -- telling it like it is: Itâs just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country.

""We the People"": Our Constitution begins with those three simple words -- words weâve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together; that thatâs how we might perfect our union.

And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe most important thing, that I want to say tonight. The future we want, all of us want -- opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids -- all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics.

A better politics doesnât mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country -- different regions, different attitudes, different interests. Thatâs one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.

But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesnât -- It doesnât work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice. It doesnât work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise, or when even basic facts are contested, or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesnât matter -- that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.

Too many Americans feel that way right now. Itâs one of the few regrets of my presidency -- that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt a -- a President with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide. And I guarantee Iâll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.

But my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task -- or any Presidentâs -- alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber -- good people -- who -- who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know -- youâve told me. Itâs the worst-kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you arenât enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor.

But that means if we want a better politics -- and Iâm addressing the American people now -- if we want a better politics, itâs not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a President. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.

I think weâve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around. Let a bipartisan group do it. I believe weâve got to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families or hidden interests canât bankroll our elections. And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform canât pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution, because itâs a problem. And most of you donât like raising money. I know. Iâve done it. Weâve got to make it easier to vote, not harder. We need to modernize it for the way we live now.

This is America! We want to make it easier for people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that. But I canât do these things on my own. Changes in our political process -- in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected -- that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. Thatâs whatâs meant by a government of, by, and for the people.

What Iâm suggesting is hard. Itâs a -- a lot easier to be cynical, to accept that change is not possible, and politics is hopeless, and the problem is, all the folks who are elected donât care, and to believe that our voices and our actions donât matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure.

And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who donât look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background. We canât afford to go down that path. It wonât deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.

So my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen -- to vote, to speak out, to stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us.

We need every American to stay active in our public life, and not just during election time, so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day. It is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that, a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen -- inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have helped America travel so far; voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino; not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not Democrat or Republican; but as Americans first, bound by a common creed; voices Dr. King believed would have the final word -- voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.

And theyâre out there, those voices. They donât get a lot of attention. They donât seek a lot of fanfare. But theyâre busy doing the work this country needs doing. I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding.

I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.

I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early, maybe with some extra supplies that she bought, because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease.

I see it in the American whoâs served his time, made bad mistakes as a child, but now is dreaming of starting over. And I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance; the protester determined to prove that justice matters; and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.

I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him until he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on.

Itâs the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything heâs been taught.

I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them, in different ways, know how much that precious right is worth.

Thatâs the America I know. Thatâs the country we love -- clear-eyed, big-hearted, undaunted by challenge, optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.

Thatâs what makes me so hopeful about our future.

I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people.

And thatâs why I stand here, as confident as I have ever been, that the state of our Union is strong.

Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. 
","President Barack Obama, in his final State of the Union address, argued the U.S. has made significant progress on economic and national-security issues and offered an optimistic vision for the future that stands in contrast to the mood of many Americans.

Mr. Obama's address Tuesday night hit a series of familiar Democratic themes. He backed labor unions and said it was Wall Street, not immigrants and low-income Americans, that precipitated the economic crisis. But a major theme of the president's speech was a robust defense of his leadership on security issues and America's standing in the world. On those and other issues, Mr. Obama repudiated the rhetoric from Republicans on the 2016 campaign trail.

""The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth -- period,"" Mr. Obama said. ""When it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead -- they call us.""

His speech reflected a president with diminishing time to advance a policy agenda, who instead is challenging Americans to embrace his vision for the country's future as he begins to make the case for electing a successor who would fulfill it.

""Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction,"" Mr. Obama said, poking again at his GOP critics. ""What is true -- and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious -- is that the economy has been changing in profound ways.""

But, he said, ""The future we want -- opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids -- all that is within our reach.""

In the formal GOP response, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said that if a Republican were elected president, ""taxes would be lower for working families, and we'd put the brakes on runaway spending and debt.""

The president's optimistic speech came amid continued economic anxiety and Americans' heightened concerns about terrorism threats at home and growing unrest overseas.

Those concerns have been stoked by recent Islamic State-inspired attacks, as well as a suicide bombing Tuesday in Istanbul by a member of the group. Mr. Obama's speech also came just hours after Iran detained two small Navy boats and was holding 10 American crew members Tuesday in the Persian Gulf, and it followed a nuclear test by North Korea last week.

Republicans, before the speech, had called on Mr. Obama to use it to ease the country's fears by outlining a detailed strategy for combating Islamic State.

""Americans are so anxious right now about their security, about what's going on around the world,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said Tuesday, noting the attack in Istanbul.

Some 70% of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, according to a December Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. The poll also found 51% of Americans disapprove of the job Mr. Obama is doing, while 43% approve.

Pushing back against some of his critics running for the GOP presidential nomination, Mr. Obama said the U.S. approach to threats overseas ""needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians.""

""That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage,"" he said.

Without naming him, he criticized Republican front-runner Donald Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslims in the U.S., and he suggested that was leading to an unwelcoming tone overall.

""When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn't make us safer,"" Mr. Obama said ""That's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.""

On the epidemic of heroin and opioid addiction, which has emerged as an issue in the 2016 campaign, Mr. Obama urged action but noted ""that because it's an election season, expectations for what we'll achieve this year are low.""

The president also nodded to the election season at the start of his address, quipping that he would be shaking hands after his speech and could offer some advice on retail politicking in Iowa.

Mr. Obama called on Congress to pass several of his priorities: changes to the criminal-justice system, a new trade agreement with Asia and legislation lifting the longtime U.S. embargo on Cuba. Those policies have bipartisan support, but it isn't clear that Congress would pass them this year.

He also challenged lawmakers to vote on a new authorization for the use of military force against Islamic State, which has languished in Congress and is unlikely to advance this year.

Yet, the crux of Mr. Obama's speech was a challenge to Americans to address four issues -- the economy, technology, national security and politics -- that he believes are critical to the country's future.

Seeking to address anxiety over the economy, Mr. Obama called on Americans to coalesce around a set of prescriptions largely supported by his Democratic Party, including raising the federal minimum wage. And he made the case that the U.S. is in the midst of a historic economic transition driven by technology.

Changing politics in Washington was one of Mr. Obama's top priorities when he entered the White House in 2009, and he said he was sorry that would likely be unfulfilled.

""It's one of the few regrets of my presidency -- that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,"" Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama said the U.S. has had foreign-policy successes in using diplomatic outreach over military power, pointing to the Iran nuclear deal and the restoration of U.S. relations with Cuba. He also highlighted the U.S. role in ending the Ebola outbreak in Africa.

But Mr. Obama is likely to leave office without managing to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his tenure has seen soured U.S. relations with Russia, an increasingly assertive China and a worsening conflict in Syria.

Republicans have been pressing Mr. Obama to more aggressively confront Iran, which has conducted two ballistic missile tests since the nuclear deal was reached last July. The House scheduled votes on new Iran sanctions for Wednesday. The White House has said Mr. Obama would veto the bill.

""The House will not sit back and wait for the president,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said Tuesday.

In his speech, Mr. Obama stopped short of suggesting Islamic State is an existential threat to the U.S., a designation his aides said he believes would elevate the group.

""Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage,"" Mr. Obama said. ""But they do not threaten our national existence.""
","President Obama on Tuesday set forth an ambitious vision for America's future but conceded his own failure to heal the political divisions holding back progress, calling it a lasting disappointment of his tenure.

In a prime-time televised speech that avoided the usual litany of policy prescriptions, Mr. Obama used his final State of the Union address to paint a hopeful portrait of the nation after seven years of his leadership, with a resurgent economy and better standing in the world despite inequality at home and terrorism abroad.

But Mr. Obama, who campaigned for president on promises of hope and change, and vowed when he took office to transform Washington and politics itself, accepted responsibility for falling far short of that goal.

""It's one of the few regrets of my presidency, that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,"" Mr. Obama said, adding that ""a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide.""

He acknowledged that many Americans feel frightened and shut out of a political and economic system they view as rigged against their interests, even as he offered an implicit rebuke of Republicans who are playing on those insecurities in the race to succeed him.

""As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background,"" Mr. Obama said. ""We can't afford to go down that path.""

He repeatedly sought to contrast Republicans' bleak appraisals of the state of the nation with his own upbeat assessment. He called his opponents' version ""a fiction"" and defended his decisions, many of them flash points for the partisan divide. Mr. Obama implicitly singled out Donald J. Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, for pointed criticism, saying that Americans must resist calls to stigmatize all Muslims at a time of threats from the Islamic State.

""Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people?"" Mr. Obama said. ""Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?""

He also made an indirect but derisive reference to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another Republican presidential contender who has criticized Mr. Obama's foreign policy and urged him to ""carpet bomb"" the Islamic State.

""The world will look to us to help solve these problems,"" Mr. Obama said of global challenges, ""and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.""

The speech, a mix of Mr. Obama's often lofty rhetoric and punchy, colloquial language, drew more scattered applause than in earlier years. The president appeared liberated by his decision not to present the usual menu of legislative proposals, although it lasted an hour and four minutes, longer than some past addresses. Mr. Obama spoke informally at times, and with occasional flashes of humor.

""Now I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon,"" he said at one point, as the sound of a single person clapping on the Republican side could be heard in the chamber. Mr. Obama smiled. ""A little applause back there,"" he said wryly.

Mr. Obama opted for symbolism to make some of his points, leaving a chair empty in the first lady's guest box to symbolize the victims of gun violence. The other seats were filled by an array of guests including a Syrian refugee. Among the guests invited by Republican lawmakers was Kim Davis, the Kentucky court clerk who became a folk hero to social conservatives for refusing to sign marriage certificates for same-sex couples.

In his remarks, Mr. Obama said America should harness innovation and not be intimidated by it. He called for a ""moonshot"" effort to cure cancer, to be led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., who lost his son to the disease last year.

The address before a joint session of Congress departed from Mr. Obama's past practice of outlining executive actions intended to sidestep gridlock in Washington.

Instead, Mr. Obama sought to pose and answer the four central questions his aides said were driving the debate about America's future, including how to ensure opportunity for everyone, how to harness technological change, how to keep the country safe, and how to fix the nation's broken politics.

He called for an end to gerrymandering -- the gaming of political districts to ensure one party's advantage -- reducing the influence of secretive campaign contributions and making voting easier. Mr. Obama also called on Americans to get more involved in politics and participate, a theme of his first campaign and of his presidency.

The speech was one of Mr. Obama's few remaining opportunities to shape the public conversation before the nation's attention shifts to the campaign to replace him that is already underway. Except for a final address at the Democratic convention this summer, Tuesday night might have been Mr. Obama's last big speech.

""I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa -- I've been there,"" he said at the start, acknowledging that the political focus is on the state, which holds the country's first nominating caucuses.

Mr. Obama was determined that the address be forward-looking, aides said, even as his time remaining in the White House is limited. The president called for compromise with Republicans on an overhaul of the criminal justice system, approval of a broad free-trade agreement spanning the Pacific Rim and new initiatives to address poverty and the opioid crisis in the United States. He proposed to provide jobless workers with retraining in addition to the unemployment payments they already received.

In an effort to find common ground with Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, Mr. Obama noted that Mr. Ryan, a Republican, supports expanding a federal tax credit for low- and middle-income workers. ""Who knows, we might surprise the cynics again,"" he said, noting a bipartisan budget agreement they struck late last year.

And he repeated past calls for legislative action on his domestic initiatives that have fallen short, including raising the minimum wage, revising the nation's immigration laws and enacting stricter gun restrictions.

He used the speech to trace the arc of his presidency and its major themes: the economic collapse and recovery, the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the push for free trade and climate pacts, and his failed bids for an immigration overhaul and new gun laws.

Mr. Obama also argued that the country's most acute challenges emanate not from the strength of adversaries -- a primary criticism of Republicans who portray the president as feckless in the face of mounting threats -- but from their weakness.

He defended his approach to taking on the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, describing it as a dangerous threat to the United States that must be dealt with, but not an existential one, and not a force that warrants a commitment of American ground forces in Iraq and Syria.

The president also said the United States is uniquely positioned to rally other countries to solve global problems, highlighting his work in forging a nuclear deal with Iran, opening a new era of relations with Cuba, pressing for a global accord reached in Paris to combat climate change and efforts to stop the spread of Ebola.

Republicans, too, used the occasion to contrast their agenda and their values with those of the sitting president, and to offer their own, far more negative assessment of his tenure.

""The president's record has often fallen far short of his soaring words,"" Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina said in her official response, delivered immediately after Mr. Obama's. ""As he enters his final year in office, many Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels.""

""Even worse,"" she added, ""we are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since September 11th, and this president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with it.""

""If we held the White House,"" Ms. Haley said, taxes would be lower, spending slowed and the military strengthened.

""We would make international agreements that were celebrated in Israel and protested in Iran, not the other way around,"" she said, referring to the international agreement Mr. Obama pressed for that lifts sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions to its nuclear ability.

91,91,2016-02-16-ScaliaDies.txt,"Good evening, everybody.

For almost 30 years, Justice Antonin ""Nino"" Scalia was a larger-than-life pre[sence] on the bench: a brilliant legal mind with an energetic style, incisive wit, and colorful opinions.

He influenced a generation of judges, lawyers, and students -- and profoundly shaped the legal landscape. He will no doubt be remembered as one of the most consequential judges and thinkers to serve on the Supreme Court. Justice Scalia dedicated his life to the cornerstone of our democracy: the rule of law. Tonight, we honor his extraordinary service to our nation and remember one of the towering legal figures of our time.

Antonin Scalia was born in Trenton, New Jersey to an Italian immigrant family. After graduating from Georgetown University and Harvard Law School, he worked at a law firm and taught law before entering a life of public service. He rose from Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel to the Judge on the D.C. Circuit Court, to Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

A devout Catholic, he was the proud father of nine children and grandfather to many [28] loving grandchildren. Justice Scalia was both an avid hunter and an opera lover -- a passion for music that he shared with his dear colleague and friend, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Michelle and I were proud to welcome him to the White House, including in 2012 for a State Dinner for Prime Minister David Cameron. And tonight, we join his fellow justices in mourning this remarkable man.

Obviously today is a time to remember Justice Scaliaâs legacy. I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time. And there will be plenty of time for me to do so, and for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote. These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone. Theyâre bigger than any one party. They are about our democracy. Theyâre about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life, and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our Founders envisioned.

But at this moment, we most of all want to think about his family; and Michelle and I join the nation in sending our deepest sympathies to Justice Scaliaâs wife, Maureen, and their loving family -- a beautiful symbol of a life well lived. We thank them for sharing Justice Scalia with our country.

God bless them all, and God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama's vow to nominate a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, and Republicans' determination to stop that nomination, mean the two parties are prepared to make the long-term direction of the Supreme Court a central issue in the 2016 campaign.

The death of Justice Scalia over the weekend put the White House and the Republican-led Congress on a high-stakes collision course that by Monday seemed almost unavoidable.

The White House is gearing up for a titanic fight over Mr. Obama's nominee, which his aides said he would announce in coming weeks, and began reaching out to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

Mr. Obama is rejecting calls from Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail for him to leave the Supreme Court vacancy for his successor to fill. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said doing so would be ""irresponsible and unprecedented.""

""The president will take the time and rigor that this process deserves before selecting a nominee,"" Mr. Schultz said. ""We believe it would be wholly irresponsible to leave the Supreme Court short staffed, especially considering the important work pending before them.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has suggested that any nominee Mr. Obama chooses would go nowhere in the Senate. Other Republican senators have taken the same view.

""I intend to make 2016 a referendum on the Supreme Court,"" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate, said Monday while campaigning in South Carolina.

While the Senate has in the past confirmed Supreme Court justices in a presidential election year, those cases are rare and most occurred before the issue of judicial appointments became such a political flashpoint. The last Supreme Court nominee to be confirmed during an election year was Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988. But his nomination had been announced the previous year, and came after President Ronald Reagan's first two nominees fell through. Justice Kennedy received unanimous support in the Senate.

A protracted fight over a successor could hobble the Supreme Court as it prepares to rule on politically divisive cases involving abortion, contraception coverage, unions and voting rights. Conservatives had been counting on their narrow majority; an empty seat instead could result in a 4-4 deadlock. Among them:

-- A challenge to a Texas law requiring abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory care centers and doctors to hold admitting privileges at a local hospital.

-- A California case questioning whether public employees can be required to join a union or pay it a fee for collective-bargaining services.

-- Another Texas case that questions whether legislative districts must be equal in population, or whether only registered voters, or only U.S. citizens, should be counted.

On the other hand, while the court's right has lost a singular voice, it has retained the votes to restrict abortion access. In the abortion case, if Justice Kennedy -- historically, a swing vote on abortion rights -- sides with fellow conservatives to uphold the Texas law while liberals vote to strike it down, the 4-4 split will leave the state's restrictions in force.

The White House's approach to the fight over a pivotal lifetime appointment will fundamentally shape the debate. As he weighs a list of potential nominees, Mr. Obama faces several possible strategies in his attempt to install a third Supreme Court justice during his presidency.

Any approach faces significant obstacles.

""There's a chance -- but not a great chance -- that he could find a way to thread the needle,"" Matt Bennett, a Democratic strategist and senior vice president at Washington, D.C., think tank Third Way, said of the president.

Some Democrats have promoted the idea of Mr. Obama using the vacancy to make a political statement by nominating a liberal, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who could rally the party base heading into the November election.

White House officials shot down such speculation, saying Mr. Obama would rather leave his own imprint on the Supreme Court than make a symbolic move intended to benefit Democratic candidates.

The president appears to be on track to select a nominee who might win the bipartisan support needed for confirmation, a path that suggests a more moderate candidate whose record could deflect charges of extremism.

Mr. Schultz said the president is seeking a justice ""who will faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand,"" and would rely on ""ethics and moral bearings"" in cases where the law is ambiguous. In Mr. Obama's view, justice isn't about ""some abstract legal theory,"" but ""about the reality of how it affects people's lives,"" the spokesman said.

Selecting a more moderate nominee could raise the political stakes for Republicans, particularly GOP senators defending seats in Democratic-leaning states, pinning Mr. Obama's hopes on enough of them breaking ranks to approve his nominee.

There are risks for Republicans if they outright reject any Obama nominee. While many Republicans may see that position as principled, Democrats would argue it reflects pure partisanship, and will lead to more gridlock and division.

More significantly, Republicans risk a Pyrrhic victory should they stymie Mr. Obama's plans for the court. If their gamble fails -- and Democrats retain the White House, capture the Senate or both -- Republicans can expect no quarter from their opponents. A Democratic president might be inclined to nominate a more liberal figure than the more moderate one Mr. Obama is likely to put forward.

That leaves open the possibility of a recess appointment to the court. The White House was cool to the option, which would both limit the nominee's time on the high court and touch off a political storm.

The president can bypass Senate approval and appoint an official for a maximum two-year term if a vacancy occurs while Congress is in recess. However, courts ruled that Mr. Obama overstepped his authority in January 2012 by filling three long-standing vacancies on the National Labor Relations Board while the Senate was on a three-day break.

A 2014 Supreme Court ruling on those appointments narrowed the opening a president can use while the Senate is in recess, effectively giving the Senate control over the power.

Still, Senate Republicans could agree to take a recess and allow Mr. Obama to appoint a caretaker justice, ensuring the court was fully staffed for a period of time. Senate Republicans would avoid voting on an Obama nominee and allow the next president and Senate to decide whether the recess appointee deserves confirmation.
","Justice Antonin Scalia, whose transformative legal theories, vivid writing and outsize personality made him a leader of a conservative intellectual renaissance in his three decades on the Supreme Court, was found dead on Saturday at a resort in West Texas. He was 79.

""He was an extraordinary individual and jurist, admired and treasured by his colleagues,"" Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said in a statement confirming Justice Scalia's death. ""His passing is a great loss to the Court and the country he so loyally served.""

The cause of death was not immediately released. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals Service, which sent personnel to the scene, said there was nothing to indicate the death was the result of anything other than natural causes.

Justice Scalia began his service on the court as an outsider known for caustic dissents that alienated even potential allies. But his theories, initially viewed as idiosyncratic, gradually took hold, and not only on the right and not only in the courts.

He was, Judge Richard A. Posner wrote in The New Republic in 2011, ""the most influential justice of the last quarter century."" Justice Scalia was a champion of originalism, the theory of constitutional interpretation that seeks to apply the understanding of those who drafted and ratified the Constitution. In Justice Scalia's hands, originalism generally led to outcomes that pleased political conservatives, but not always. His approach was helpful to criminal defendants in cases involving sentencing and the cross-examination of witnesses.

Justice Scalia also disdained the use of legislative history -- statements from members of Congress about the meaning and purposes of laws -- in the judicial interpretation of statutes. He railed against vague laws that did not give potential defendants fair warning of what conduct was criminal. He preferred bright-line rules to legal balancing tests, and he was sharply critical of Supreme Court opinions that did not provide lower courts and litigants with clear guidance.

All of these views took shape in dissents. Over time, they came to influence and in many cases dominate the debate at the Supreme Court, in lower courts, among lawyers and in the legal academy.

By the time he wrote his most important majority opinion, finding that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms, even the dissenters were engaged in trying to determine the original meaning of the Constitution, the approach he had championed.

That 2008 decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, also illustrated a second point: Justice Scalia in his later years was willing to bend a little to attract votes from his colleagues. In Heller, the price of commanding a majority appeared to be including a passage limiting the practical impact of the decision.

With the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens in 2010, Justice Scalia became the longest serving member of the current court. By then, Justice Scalia was routinely writing for the majority in the major cases, including ones on the First Amendment, class actions and arbitration.

He was an exceptional stylist who labored over his opinions and took pleasure in finding precisely the right word or phrase. In dissent, he took no prisoners. The author of a majority opinion could be confident that a Scalia dissent would not overlook any shortcomings.

Justice Scalia wrote for a broader audience than most of his colleagues. His opinions were read by lawyers and civilians for pleasure and instruction.

At oral argument, Justice Scalia took professorial delight in sparring with the advocates before him. He seemed to play to the crowd in the courtroom, which rewarded his jokes with generous laughter.

Justice Scalia's sometimes withering questioning helped transform what had been a sleepy bench when he arrived into one that Chief Justice Roberts has said has become too active, with the justices interrupting the lawyers and each other.

Some of Justice Scalia's recent comments from the bench were raw and provocative. In an affirmative action case in December, he said that some minority students may be better off at ""a less advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well.""

""I don't think it stands to reason that it's a good thing for the University of Texas to admit as many blacks as possible,"" he said, describing -- some said distorting -- an argument in a supporting brief about the harm that can be caused to students with inferior academic credentials by admitting them to colleges where they do not thrive.

Justice Scalia was a man of varied tastes, with a fondness for poker, opera and hunting. His friends called him Nino, and they said he enjoyed nothing more than a good joke at his own expense.

He seldom agreed with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the important questions that reached the court, but the two for years celebrated New Year's Eve together. Not long after Justice Elena Kagan, another liberal, joined the court, Justice Scalia took her skeet shooting.

Family Influence

Antonin Gregory Scalia was born on March 11, 1936, in Trenton, to Salvatore Scalia and the former Catherine Panaro. He was their only child and was showered with attention from his parents and their siblings, none of whom had children of their own.

Justice Scalia and his wife, the former Maureen McCarthy, had nine children, the upshot of what he called Vatican roulette. ""We were both devout Catholics,"" Justice Scalia told Joan Biskupic for her 2009 biography, ""American Original."" ""And being a devout Catholic means you have children when God gives them to you, and you raise them.""

He said his large family influenced his legal philosophy.

""Parents know that children will accept quite readily all sorts of arbitrary substantive dispositions -- no television in the afternoon, or no television in the evening, or even no television at all,"" he said at a Harvard lecture in 1989. ""But try to let one brother or sister watch television when the others do not, and you will feel the fury of the fundamental sense of justice unleashed.""

Young Antonin was an exceptional student, graduating as valedictorian from Xavier High School in Lower Manhattan, first in his class at Georgetown and magna cum laude at Harvard Law School.

He practiced law for six years in Cleveland before accepting a position teaching law at the University of Virginia in 1967. Four years later, he entered government service, first as general counsel of the Office of Telecommunications Policy and then as chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, an executive branch agency that advises federal regulators. Both positions drew on and expanded his expertise in administrative law, a topic that would interest him throughout his career.

In 1974, President Richard M. Nixon nominated him to be assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel, an elite unit of the Justice Department that advises the executive branch on the law. He was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974, not long after Mr. Nixon resigned.

In 1977, Mr. Scalia returned to the legal academy, now joining the law faculty at the University of Chicago. He also served as editor of Regulation magazine, published by the American Enterprise Institute.

After Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, Mr. Scalia was interviewed for a job he coveted, solicitor general of the United States, the lawyer who represents the federal government in the Supreme Court. He lost out to Rex E. Lee, and it stung. ""I was bitterly disappointed,"" Justice Scalia told Ms. Biskupic. ""I never forgot it.""

He was offered a seat on the federal appeals court in Chicago. But he turned it down in the hope of being nominated instead to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, whose docket, location and prestige appealed to him. The court was also widely viewed as a steppingstone to the Supreme Court.

The first opening on the D.C. Circuit in the Reagan years went to another prominent conservative law professor, Robert H. Bork. But the second one, in 1982, went to Mr. Scalia.

He served for four years, issuing opinions favoring executive power, skeptical of claims of employment discrimination and hostile to the press. The opinions, which were forceful and sometimes funny, attracted the attention of the White House.

He appeared to enjoy intellectual give-and-take from the bench, with his colleagues and in his chambers. On the appeals court and in his early years on the Supreme Court, he would hire one liberal law clerk each year to keep discussions lively.

""He made it a point of telling me that I was his token liberal,"" said E. Joshua Rosenkranz, who served as a law clerk for Judge Scalia in 1986, his last year on the appeals court. ""To his credit, I'm sure it was largely because he wanted to be sure he always heard the arguments against the positions he was taking.""

Unanimous Confirmation

In 1986, after Chief Justice Warren Burger announced his intention to retire, Mr. Reagan nominated Judge Scalia to the Supreme Court. Though his conservative views were well known, he was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 98 to 0. He may have benefited from the fact that the liberal opposition was focused on the nomination of Justice William H. Rehnquist, who was already on the court, to succeed Chief Justice Burger.

Judge Scalia seemed to enjoy parrying with the senators at his confirmation hearing. When Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, recalled losing to Judge Scalia in a tennis match, he responded that ""it was a case of my integrity overcoming my judgment.""

The lopsided vote for Justice Scalia also reflected a different era, one in which presidents were thought to have wide latitude in naming judges. That era seemed to come to an end in 1987, with the defeat of the nomination of Justice Scalia's former colleague on the D.C. Circuit, Judge Bork.

In 1993, at the confirmation hearing for Justice Ginsburg, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said ""the vote that I most regret of all 15,000 votes I have cast as a senator"" was ""to confirm Judge Scalia"" -- ""because he was so effective.""

Three days before the court handed the presidency to Mr. Bush in December 2000, in Bush v. Gore, the court shut down the recount of votes in Florida in an unsigned opinion over the dissents of the four more liberal justices. Justice Scalia felt compelled to respond in a concurrence.

""The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to"" Mr. Bush ""and to the country, by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election,"" Justice Scalia wrote. He would later say privately that his brief concurrence doomed his chances of being named chief justice.

He was often asked about the Bush v. Gore decision at public appearances. His stock response: ""Get over it.""

'Faint-Hearted Originalist'

The centerpiece of Justice Scalia's judicial philosophy was his commitment to the doctrine of originalism, which sought to interpret the Constitution as it was understood at the time of its adoption. That made him uncomfortable with some of the Supreme Court's most important precedents.

""We have now determined,"" he said in remarks in Philadelphia in 2004, ""that liberties exist under the federal Constitution -- the right to abortion, the right to homosexual sodomy -- which were so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that they were criminal for 200 years.""

He added that his colleagues may soon discover a right to assisted suicide between the lines of the text of the Constitution.

""We're not ready to announce that right,"" he said, more than a little sarcastically. ""Check back with us.""

Justice Scalia said that some of the court's leading decisions could not be justified under the original understanding of the Constitution. The court was wrong in Gideon v. Wainwright in 1963, Justice Scalia said, to require the government to provide lawyers to poor people accused of serious crimes. It was wrong in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964, he said, to say the First Amendment requires libel plaintiffs to meet heightened standards.

Justice Scalia also appeared to have reservations about Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down segregation in public schools as a violation of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. Brown, decided in 1954, is widely considered the towering achievement of the court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren.

But for originalists, the Brown decision is problematic. The weight of the historical evidence is that the people who drafted, proposed and ratified the 14th Amendment from 1866 to 1868 did not believe themselves to be doing away with segregated schools.

In remarks at the University of Arizona in 2009, Justice Scalia suggested that Brown reached the right result as a matter of policy but was not required by the Constitution. He added that the decision did not refute his theory.

""Don't make up your mind on this significant question between originalism and playing it by ear on the basis of whether, now and then, the latter approach might give you a result you like,"" Justice Scalia said.

""Hitler developed a wonderful automobile,"" he went on. ""What does that prove? I'll stipulate that you can reach some results you like with the other system. But that's not the test. The test is over the long run does it require the society to adhere to those principles contained in the Constitution or does it lead to a society that is essentially governed by nine justices' version of what equal protection ought to mean?""

In other settings, Justice Scalia took pains to say that he would not follow his theory wherever it would take him. He was, he said, ""a faint-hearted originalist.""

""I am a textualist,"" he said. ""I am an originalist. I am not a nut.""

Critics seized on the concession, saying it undid the very qualities that made originalism appealing as a historically grounded theory that constrained judges otherwise apt to follow their policy preferences.

""If following a theory consistently would make you a nut, isn't that a problem with the theory?"" David A. Strauss asked in his 2010 book, ""The Living Constitution.""

There was certainly a more committed originalist on the court, Justice Clarence Thomas. Unlike Justice Thomas, Justice Scalia, especially in his later years, was willing to compromise at the expense of theoretical purity.

A 2010 decision, McDonald v. Chicago, illustrates the point. The question in the case was whether the Second Amendment applied not only to federal gun control laws, a point the court established in 2008, but also to state and local laws. The answer was not much in doubt, as the five-justice majority in the 2008 case, District of Columbia v. Heller, was still on the court.

What was in doubt was how the court would use the 14th Amendment to apply -- or ""incorporate,"" in the legal jargon -- the Second Amendment to the states. Other provisions in the Bill of Rights had been applied by means of the 14th Amendment's due process clause.

But many judges and scholars, including Justice Scalia, had never found that methodology intellectually satisfactory. ""Due process"" after all, would seem to protect only procedures and not substance. The very name given to the methodology -- substantive due process -- sounds like an oxymoron.

Originalists hoped the court would use the McDonald case to repudiate substantive due process and instead rely on another provision of the 14th Amendment, one that says ""no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."" There is evidence that the authors of the clause specifically wanted it to apply to allowing freed slaves to have guns to defend themselves.

Justice Scalia would have none of it. ""What you argue,"" he told a lawyer challenging a Chicago gun law, ""is the darling of the professoriate, for sure, but it's also contrary to 140 years of our jurisprudence.""

He told the lawyer to focus on winning his case rather than pressing a new constitutional theory. ""Why do you want to undertake that burden,"" Justice Scalia asked, ""instead of just arguing substantive due process, which as much as I think it's wrong, even I have acquiesced in it?""

The decision was 5 to 4. The justices in the majority agreed about the result but not how to get there. Justice Scalia accepted the substantive due process rationale, with misgivings. Justice Thomas, in a separate opinion, relied on the privileges-or-immunities rationale that had been pressed by originalists.

Still, Justice Scalia's fidelity to originalism frequently caused him to take legal positions almost certainly at odds with his policy preferences. He voted in 1989 to strike down a law making it a crime to burn an American flag.

He said his fidelity to the Constitution overrode his sympathies. ""I don't like scruffy, bearded, sandal-wearing people who go around burning the United States flag,"" he said in 2000.

Transforming Criminal Law

Justice Scalia also helped transform aspects of the criminal law, often in ways that helped people accused of crimes. Here, too, his understanding of the Sixth Amendment, which sets out defendants' rights in criminal prosecutions, may have been in tension with his policy preferences.

""The Sixth Amendment is a meaningful presence in American courtrooms today in large part because of Justice Scalia,"" said Jeffrey L. Fisher, a law professor at Stanford. ""He followed his understanding of the original intent of the Sixth Amendment, even when it made prosecutions harder and less efficient. He said it was necessary to keep the people free.""

The right to trial by an impartial jury, Justice Scalia said, means that juries must find beyond reasonable doubt all facts that give rise to punishment. He made the point in a 1998 dissent, and it ripened into the majority view in Apprendi v. New Jersey in 2000, which struck down a New Jersey hate crime law. In 2004, Justice Scalia relied on the Apprendi decision in writing the majority opinion in Blakely v. Washington, which struck down the sentencing system of Washington State for giving judges too large a role. He later voted with the majority to strike down the federal sentencing system on the same grounds.

""It's not because I'm in love with the jury necessarily,"" Justice Scalia told Ms. Biskupic. ""It's because I'm in love with the Constitution.""

Justice Scalia also reinvigorated the clause of the Sixth Amendment that guarantees a criminal defendant the right ""to be confronted with the witnesses against him.""

Here, too, he first expressed his views in dissent. Later, in a 2004 decision, Crawford v. Washington, he wrote for the majority that defendants have the right to live testimony at trial from the witnesses against them, even if the accusations could be presented in other forms.

""Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with a jury trial because the defendant is obviously guilty,"" Justice Scalia wrote. ""That is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.""

Writing for the majority in a 2009 decision that barred the introduction at trial of crime lab reports without testimony from the analysts involved in their preparation, Justice Scalia said the issue was one of constitutional principle.

""The confrontation clause may make the prosecution of criminals more burdensome, but that is equally true of the right to trial by jury and the privilege against self-incrimination,"" he wrote. ""The confrontation clause -- like those other constitutional provisions -- is binding, and we may not disregard it at our convenience.

Justice Scalia's opinions were also helpful to criminal defendants charged under vague laws. In 2009, he objected to the court's decision not to hear an appeal concerning a federal law that made it a crime ""to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services."" The law was so vague, he wrote, that ""it would seemingly cover a salaried employee's phoning in sick to go to a ballgame.""

The Supreme Court soon agreed to hear three separate cases on the law and substantially cut back its scope.

When Justice Scalia joined the court, congressional committee reports and similar ""legislative history"" were routinely used as aids in determining the meanings of federal statutes.

In a campaign that he maintained throughout his tenure on the court, Justice Scalia insisted that such use of legislative history was illegitimate. Reports and floor statements were not the law, he said; the words of the law itself were the law.

The campaign was largely successful. Advocates and other justices rely on legislative history sparingly these days.

Justice Scalia was also dismissive of unhelpful Supreme Court opinions. Concurring in a 2010 privacy decision that gave lower courts only vague guidance, he wrote: ""The court's implication that where electronic privacy is concerned we should decide less than we otherwise would (that is, less than the principle of law necessary to resolve the case and guide private action) -- or that we should hedge our bets by concocting case-specific standards or issuing opaque opinions -- is in my view indefensible. The-times-they-are-a-changin' is a feeble excuse for disregard of duty.""

His colleagues always welcomed his writing style, which could verge on the insulting. Dissenting in a 2002 decision prohibiting the execution of the mentally retarded, he wrote, ""seldom has an opinion of this court rested so obviously upon nothing but the personal views of its members."" An argument made by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, he wrote in a 1989 abortion case, ""cannot be taken seriously.""

In a 2011 dissent, Justice Scalia called Justice Sonia Sotomayor's account of the facts of a case in her majority opinion ""so transparently false that professing to believe it demeans this institution.""

Dissenting in June from the court's decision establishing a right to same-sex marriage, Justice Scalia mocked the soaring language of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's majority opinion, saying it was ""couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.""

He was not shy about making dire predictions. About a 2008 decision giving people held at GuantÃ¡namo Bay the right to challenge their detentions: ""It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed."" About a 2011 decision ordering California to ease prison overcrowding: It affirmed ""the most radical injunction issued by a court in our nation's history"" and was itself ""a judicial travesty.""

A Public Life

Citing long judicial tradition, Justice Scalia occasionally spoke about his desire to stay out of the public eye. It is not clear that he meant it, and he was certainly not always successful.

In 2004, for instance, he went on a duck-hunting trip with Dick Cheney, who was then vice president and a litigant in a case before the court over whether Mr. Cheney would have to reveal who had appeared before his energy task force. When the trip came to light, Justice Scalia issued a 21-page defense of the trip and refused to disqualify himself from the case.

""While the political branches can perhaps survive the constant baseless allegations of impropriety that have become the staple of Washington reportage, this court cannot,"" he wrote. ""The people must have confidence in the integrity of the justices, and that cannot exist in a system that assumes them to be corruptible by the slightest friendship or favor, and in an atmosphere where the press will be eager to find foot-faults.""

Justice Scalia later joined the seven-justice majority in declining to force Mr. Cheney to disclose secret documents from an energy task force.

He did step aside from a case concerning the Pledge of Allegiance in 2003 after saying in public that the federal appeals court in San Francisco had decided the case incorrectly.

A gregarious man, Justice Scalia accepted many speaking and teaching engagements from both conservative and liberal groups. He was occasionally criticized for his choices.

In 2007, for instance, Justice Scalia spoke on international law at a dinner in Palm Springs, Calif., organized by Charles G. Koch, a conservative activist. Justice Scalia's expenses, a court spokeswoman said, were paid for by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group.

In 2011, he spoke at a forum organized by the Congressional Tea Party Caucus at the invitation of Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota. The session was attended by members of both parties; Justice Scalia's subject was the separation of powers.

Justice Scalia did not make it easy for journalists to cover his public appearances and generally did not allow them to be broadcast. For years, he did not allow his remarks to be taped even by print reporters seeking to ensure the accuracy of their notes.

He changed that policy in 2004 after a federal marshal ordered two reporters to erase recordings of his remarks at a high school in Hattiesburg, Miss. Justice Scalia apologized to the reporters, saying the marshal had not been following his instructions.

""I abhor as much as any American the prospect of a law enforcement officer's seizing a reporter's notes or recording,"" he wrote to one of the reporters, Antoinette Konz of The Hattiesburg American.

In 2006, Justice Scalia responded to a reporter's question after attending a Red Mass at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston with a chin flick that some interpreted to be an obscene gesture. The reporter had wanted to know whether Justice Scalia had taken ""a lot of flak for publicly celebrating"" his religious beliefs.

In a letter to The Boston Herald, Justice Scalia explained that the gesture was Sicilian in origin and meant only, ""I couldn't care less. It's no business of yours. Count me out.""

He often made clear that he had little use for faculty-lounge orthodoxies.

In 2003, for instance, dissenting from a decision striking down a Texas law that made gay sex a crime, Justice Scalia bemoaned the influence of elite culture on the law.

""Today's opinion,"" he wrote, ""is the product of a court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.""

He predicted, too, that the decision, Lawrence v. Texas, had laid the foundation for the recognition of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.

Justice Scalia insisted that his religious beliefs played no role in his jurisprudence, and he was deeply offended by contrary suggestions.

In 2007, Geoffrey R. Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago, where he was a colleague of Justice Scalia, made what he called ""a painfully awkward observation"" in The Chicago Tribune after the Supreme Court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in Gonzales v. Carhart.

""All five justices in the majority in Gonzales are Roman Catholic,"" Professor Stone wrote. ""The four justices who are not all followed clear and settled precedent.""

Justice Scalia was furious, telling Ms. Biskupic that ""it got me so mad that I will not appear at the University of Chicago until he is no longer on the faculty.""

Withdrawing from a debate was not typical of Justice Scalia, who usually welcomed discussion with enthusiasm and confidence. Standing up for one's opinions, he said in a 2010 opinion, is a mark of laudable ""civil courage.""

Indeed, Justice Scalia's appetite for the sort of discussion and debate he enjoyed as a law professor was not sated by the brisk conferences the justices held after oral arguments. Under Chief Justice Rehnquist and to a lesser extent under Chief Justice Roberts, they can consist of little more than a tally of votes.

""I don't like that,"" Justice Scalia said after a speech at George Washington University in 1988. ""Maybe it's just because I'm new. Maybe it's because I'm an ex-academic. Maybe it's because I'm right.""

In a C-Span interview in 2009, Justice Scalia reflected on his role and legacy, sketching out a modest conception of the role of a Supreme Court justice.

""We don't sit here to make the law, to decide who ought to win,"" Justice Scalia said. ""We decide who wins under the law that the people have adopted. And very often, if you're a good judge, you don't really like the result you're reaching.""

92,92,2016-03-23-BrusselsTerrorism.txt,"The American people stand with the people of Brussels. We will do whatever it takes, working with nations and peoples around the world, to bring the perpetrators of these attacks to justice, and to go after terrorists who threaten our people.

As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on March 22, 2016, in Brussels, Belgium, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, March 26, 2016.

","Terrorists struck a European capital for the second time in four months, killing dozens here Tuesday in bombings plotted under the noses of authorities just days after a prime suspect in last year's carnage in Paris was captured.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks at the Brussels airport and on a subway train, starkly demonstrating the ability of the extremist network to direct or inspire deadly assaults in Europe, even as it suffers heavy setbacks from U.S.-led military strikes in its heartlands of Syria and Iraq.

Belgian officials said they were -- once again -- conducting house searches countrywide in the hunt for one suspect. One raid in Brussels turned up an explosive device containing nails, along with an Islamic State flag and chemical products, the federal prosecutor's office said.

Authorities had warned Islamic State could try to retaliate after the capture here Friday of an alleged Islamic State operative suspected of direct involvement in the Nov. 13 attacks on Paris.

But despite the warning, additional raids and a heavy police and army presence sent to guard transport hubs and tourist areas in Brussels, more bombs went off.

At least 11 people were killed at Brussels Airport and about 100 injured after two men blew themselves up in the check-in area around 8 a.m. local time, officials said. According to a person briefed on the attack, police also exchanged fire with a man firing a Kalashnikov.

The terror attacks were the most deadly in Belgian history.

""It was apocalypse,"" said Samir Derrouich, an airport worker who was standing about 30 yards away from one blast, with windows shattering and ceiling tiles crashing to the ground.

Mariama Toure Kindon, 33-year-old barista at an airport Starbucks, said she heard a small blast and immediately thought it was a terror attack.

""I ran in the opposite direction to the exit door and a minute later the second blast happened, near the Brussels Airlines counter, and I was hit by all the glass debris,"" she said. ""Everything was covered in dust and smoke, people were crying. It was horrific.""

She had her right hand cut by the glass falling from the hall's glass wall and was hit by something heavy on the back. She managed to exit the airport and stayed for a while on the road access to the airport.

""I got scared and I moved away from the cars, I thought there could be car bombs or more,"" she said. Police officers took her to a doctor who stitched her hand. She was then evacuated home, having left ""my purse, everything, even my car,"" at the airport.

About an hour later, a rush-hour explosion in a subway car at the Maelbeek station, close to European Union offices, killed at least 20 and injured about 130.

There were scant details available about the identities of the victims of Tuesday's attacks, although U.S. officials said at least nine Americans were injured. The State Department late Tuesday issued a travel alert for all of Europe, urging U.S. citizens to consider the risks of traveling there in the aftermath of the attacks.

Brussels, which was locked down for four days in November after one of the Paris suspects fled back to his hometown, fell eerily quiet again as public transport was halted for hours and the government advised people not to leave their homes.

That suspect, a French citizen named Salah Abdeslam, was arrested with an associate Friday after an intensive manhunt. He has a court appearance set for Thursday to decide on his continued detention, his lawyer said.

Mr. Abdeslam was charged with committing ""terrorist murders"" and participating in a terrorist organization. His lawyer acknowledges he was present in Paris on the night of the attacks and says he is cooperating with investigators.

A U.S. official said the attacks appeared to be an attempt by Islamic State operatives to demonstrate their ability to rapidly retaliate in the wake of that arrest. Other officials said it was possible that terrorists, perhaps a cell directly linked to Mr. Abdeslam, accelerated an existing plan once it became public that he was cooperating with authorities.

If that is the case, their success will again raise questions about the ability of the hard-pressed Belgian authorities to manage a crisis in their midst.

Despite a well-publicized manhunt, Mr. Abdeslam was four months on the lam and was caught near his home in Brussels's district of Molenbeek, harbored apparently by accomplices who weren't under police surveillance.

The Paris attacks, which killed 130 people, made Brussels a focus of European concerns over Islamic radicalism. Investigators have said the attacks were planned in Belgium and Belgians took part in them. At least a dozen suspects, all originating from the Brussels region, have been arrested in relation to the attacks.

Islamic State claimed the Brussels attacks via its official Amaq news agency, saying it had targeted Belgium for participating in the U.S.-led coalition fighting the group in Syria and Iraq. Belgian authorities said the claim was still being verified.

Police released a photo of three men suspected of having carried out the first attack, pushing luggage carts inside the airport. Belgian broadcasters reported that the three had arrived by taxi and apparently hid the bombs in their luggage.

Federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said two were believed to have blown themselves up and the third, wearing a light-colored jacket and a hat, had apparently escaped and was being ""actively sought.""

Another explosive device that had been planted at the airport didn't go off, and was later detonated by the bomb squad, according to Arnaud Feist, CEO of the Brussels Airport.

Mr. Van Leeuw said house searches were being conducted throughout the country and witnesses questioned. The country's terror threat level was raised from three to four, the maximum level.

Claudiu Rusu, a 25-year-old Brussels student on a class trip to Portugal, said he was in the departure hall when the explosions happened. He had blood on his face, which he said came from flying glass.

""There were dead and injured people everywhere,"" he said while pushing his suitcase down a blocked-off motor way shortly after the explosions.

Marc Decramer, head of a hospital in Leuven where some of the airport victims were being treated, said that at least one of the bombs apparently contained glass and nails. ""Most of the injured are heavily wounded; fractures, burns, and also deep lacerations,"" he said.

Security was tightened at airports and train stations across Europe. The Brussels Airport was to remain closed until at least Thursday, Mr. Feist said.

In a televised address to the nation, King Philippe called the attacks ""cowardly and odious,"" and urged Belgians to ""react with determination, calmness and dignity"" and ""retain trust, as this trust is our strength.""

Prime Minister Charles Michel announced three days of national mourning. ""We have to be unified,"" he said.

On Monday, prosecutors said they were looking for 24-year-old Najim Laachraoui, another suspected Islamic State operative whose DNA was found in a Brussels apartment they believe was used to assemble the suicide vests used in Paris.

The Islamic State announcement said fighters kicked off the attack at the airport with gunfire before ""several"" of them detonated explosive belts. It said a single bomber detonated an explosives-belt at the subway station.

Alphonse Youla, who handles baggage security at the airport in the suburb of Zaventem, said he heard someone yelling in Arabic before the blasts. Afterward, he helped carry the injured, he said. ""I saw people lying on the ground with a lot of blood who weren't moving anymore.""

Then the powerful explosion hit Maelbeek subway station, very near the heart of the European quarter in Brussels.

""It was like an earthquake, the ground was trembling,"" said Christian Thiercelin, who was standing outside. He said he ran down to the tracks, where he said the explosion happened. ""I saw at least two bodies on the ground. They weren't moving anymore.""

Police closed the access road to the airport as emergency vehicles rushed in. Hundreds of passengers were still being evacuated hours after the blasts, many wrapped in airline blankets. Buses were arriving to take them away, but some headed out on their own along a highway, pulling their suitcases behind them.
","Bombs packed with nails terrorized Brussels on Tuesday in the deadliest assault on the European heartland since the Islamic State's attacks on Paris four months ago, hitting the airport and subway system in coordinated strikes that were also claimed by the militant extremist group.

The bombings paralyzed Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union and NATO, prompted international travel warnings to avoid Belgium and reverberated across the Atlantic to the United States, where New York and other major cities raised terrorism threat levels. Anxieties intensified about the inability to prevent mass killings at relatively unprotected places.

At least 30 people were killed by two blasts at the Brussels airport departure area around 8 a.m. and one in a subway station shortly after 9. The police found at least one other unexploded bomb in a search of a Brussels house hours later.

And Europe's most wanted person suddenly became an unidentified man in a white coat and dark hat seen pushing a luggage cart in an airport surveillance photo taken just before the bombings. Two other men in the photo, each wearing a black glove on his left hand, were identified by Belgian prosecutors as suspected suicide bombers who appeared to have died in the explosions.

""To those who have chosen to be the barbaric enemies of liberty, of democracy, of fundamental values, I want to say with the greatest strength that we will remain assembled and united,"" the Belgium prime minister, Charles Michel, said at a news conference Tuesday evening, declaring a three-day mourning period.

Francis Vermeiren , the mayor of Zaventem, the Brussels suburb where the airport is located, was quoted by Agence France-Presse late Tuesday as saying all three men had arrived in a taxi, putting suitcases that contained the bombs on luggage carts.

CNN reported on Tuesday night that the police removed bags of evidence from an apartment in the northeast Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, after a taxi driver who saw the photograph of the men told the authorities that he had taken them from the building to the airport that morning, with many large bags.

Passengers who had been in line at airport departure counters described sudden panic and mayhem as the explosions turned the area into a death trap with flames, smoke, flying glass, nails and shrapnel, leaving at least 10 people dead.

""We heard a big noise and saw a big flash,"" said one passenger, Ilaria Ruggiano, who had been traveling with six others, including her mother. ""My mother went to the floor -- she was hit. I just dropped my luggage and went to the floor. A kid came out, bleeding a lot. I tried to help him with a tissue, but it was not enough. There were two bombs.""

The airport was closed, disrupting and diverting dozens of flights and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded, and the Belgian authorities placed the entire metropolitan area on emergency lockdown. It was not clear when the airport would reopen; the Belgian authorities said it was certain to remain closed Wednesday because of the investigation.

Then at 9:11 a.m. -- the timing may just have been an eerie coincidence -- a bomb tore through a car in the rear part of a subway train pulling out of the busy Maelbeek station at the height of the morning rush, killing at least 20 people.

""We felt a boom; we felt the building tremble,"" said Henk Stuten, 50, who works for the European Commission in an office above the station. ""We saw through the windows that people were rushing out of the metro exit.""

More than 230 people, including people from around the world, were wounded in the three blasts.

In the afternoon, Amaq, a news agency affiliated with the Islamic State, issued a bulletin claiming responsibility for the attacks, calling them the work of suicide bombers.

FrÃ©dÃ©ric Van Leeuw, the Belgian federal prosecutor, said at a news conference on Tuesday night that ""at this stage, it is not possible to draw a formal link with the Paris attacks."" A cell of 10 operatives, a number of them from the Brussels district of Molenbeek, were implicated in the Paris attacks on Nov. 13, which left 130 people dead. The Brussels strikes came only a few days after the Belgian police captured Salah Abdeslam, the only suspect in the Paris assaults believed to have survived, who is considered a potential trove of information.

The State Department on Tuesday warned Americans traveling in Europe to ""exercise vigilance when in public places or using mass transportation."" Terrorist groups, the department travel alert said, ""continue to plan near-term attacks throughout Europe, targeting sporting events, tourist sites, restaurants and transportation.""

The threat of further bombings was underscored by the official warnings for people in Brussels to remain indoors, as an intensive search was underway by the police in the Brussels area into Tuesday evening. The federal prosecutor's office said in a statement that one of the searches, in Brussels's Schaerbeek district, led to the discovery of ""an explosive device containing nails, among other things."" The statement said ""chemical products and a flag of the Islamic State"" also had been found there.

Late Tuesday, the Belgian Federal Police released new photographs of the suspected suicide bombers and asked people to contact the agency if they recognized them. The public call suggested that whatever information investigators had gathered at the scene, such as DNA, had not yet yielded information allowing them to identify the men or they were unknown to the Belgian authorities.

The heightened security in Belgium extended to two nuclear plants, Doel and Tihange, where nonessential workers were sent home, although the plants remained operational. Ine Wenmaekers, a spokesman for the Belgian nuclear regulatory agency, said that the step was precautionary and that ""there was no direct threat to the power plants.""

World leaders reacted with horror and calls for solidarity, though the attacks also spotlighted the fractious debate over terrorism and Islam in Europe and in the American political campaign. The Eiffel Tower and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai were among the world landmarks lit up in the black, red and yellow of Belgium's flag as night fell.

""Through the Brussels attacks, it is the whole of Europe that is hit,"" President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France declared. He vowed ""to relentlessly fight terrorism, both internationally and internally.""

The French government ordered 1,600 extra police officers to patrol the nation's borders, including at train stations, airports and ports. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain called an emergency meeting of ministers. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany said the attacks ""aim at the heart of Europe."" Pope Francis expressed condolences.

President Obama, speaking in Havana, called the Brussels attacks ""yet another reminder that the world must unite, we must be together, regardless of nationality or race or faith, in fighting against the scourge of terrorism.""

But a Russian official tempered sympathy with a scolding of his European colleagues over their policies on migration and terrorism. ""It is time for Europe to understand where the real threat is coming from, and to unite its efforts with Russia,"" Aleksei K. Pushkov, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Parliament, wrote on Twitter.

Since the Paris attacks, security experts have warned that Europe was likely to face additional assaults by the Islamic State and by other militant groups.

The Paris attacks showed that the scale and sophistication of the Islamic State's efforts to carry out operations in Europe were greater than first believed, and analysts have pointed to Europe's particular vulnerabilities. They include the huge flow of undocumented migrants from the Middle East last year; the unimpeded movement of European citizens between their home countries, neighboring countries and Syria to fight with the Islamic State; and persistent problems with intelligence-sharing among European countries and even between competing security agencies in some nations.

Few countries have been more vulnerable than Belgium. Among European countries, Belgium has the highest proportion of citizens and residents who have traveled to Syria or Iraq, insular Muslim communities that have helped shield jihadists, and security services that have had persistent problems conducting effective counterterrorism operations, not least in their four-month effort to capture Mr. Abdeslam.

Photographs and amateur video posted online showed the Brussels airport passengers covered in blood and soot, looking stunned but conscious. Some passengers were seen being taken away on luggage carts.

JÃ©rÃ´me Delanois said he was at an Internet cafe near the Delta Air Lines counter when he heard a thunderous noise. ""There were two explosions -- one big one and one little one,"" he said. ""The first one blew all the walls and everything. There were burning flames. The first one was bigger. It blew out all the windows.""

Most of the wounded in the subway blast were evacuated to the Rue de la Loi, outside the station, which serves the area that hosts most of the European Union's core institutions.

Brian Carroll, 31, a communications consultant from Washington, said he was on a subway car near Maelbeek en route to a conference in downtown Brussels when he heard a loud blast.

""As we were pulling into the station, there was suddenly a loud explosion,"" he said in a phone interview. ""There was smoke everywhere. Everyone dropped to the ground. People were screaming and crying.""

Mr. Carroll said he had remained on the ground for one or two minutes, then got up, pried open a door of the subway car with his hands and fled.

""I thought to myself, 'I've got to get out of here,' "" he said. ""I headed toward an exit. There was smoke and soot everywhere. There was glass everywhere. It was like running through a cloud of dust. I saw the exit of the station was destroyed. I ran out of the station; I ran as far as I could.""

93,93,2016-04-25-HannoverTrade.txt,"Guten tag.  It is -- It is wonderful to see all of you, and I want to begin by thanking Chancellor Merkel for being here.   On behalf of the American people, I want to thank Angela for being a champion of our alliance.  And on behalf of all of us, I want to thank you for your commitment to freedom, and equality, and human rights, which is a reflection of your inspiring life.  I truly believe youâve shown us the leadership of steady hands -- how do you call it?  The Merkel-Raute.  And over the last seven years, I have relied on your friendship and counsel, and your firm moral compass.  So we very much appreciate your Chancellor, Angela Merkel.

To the members of the Bundestag, Prime Minister Weil, Mayor Schostock, distinguished guests, people of Germany.  And Iâm especially pleased to see the young people here -- from Germany and across Europe.  We also have some proud Americans here.

I have to admit that I have developed a special place in my heart for the German people.  Back when I was a candidate for this office, you welcomed me with a small rally in Berlin, where I spoke of the change thatâs possible when the world stands as one.  As President, you've treated me and Michelle and our daughters to wonderful hospitality.  You've offered me excellent beer -- and weisswurst in Krun.  You've now hosted our delegation here in Hannover. 

My only regret is that I have never been to Germany for Oktoberfest.    So I will have to come back.  And I suspect it's more fun when you're not President.  So my timing will be good.

And as always, I bring the friendship of the American people.  We consider the German people, and all of our European allies, to be among our closest friends in the world -- because we share so much experience and so many of the same values.  We believe that nations and peoples should live in security and peace.  We believe in creating opportunity that lifts up not just the few but the many.  And Iâm proud to be the first American President to come to Europe and be able to say that, in the United States, health care is not a privilege, it is now a right for all.  We share that as well.

Perhaps most importantly, we believe in the equality and inherent dignity of every human being.  Today in America, people have the freedom to marry the person that they love.  We believe in justice, that no child in the world should ever die from a mosquito bite; that no one should suffer from the ache of an empty stomach; that, together, we can save our planet and the worldâs most vulnerable people from the worst effects of climate change.  These are things that we share.  It's borne of common experience.

And this is what I want to talk to you about today -- the future that we are building together -- not separately, but together.  And that starts right here in Europe.

And I want to begin with an observation that, given the challenges that we face in the world and the headlines we see every day, may seem improbable, but itâs true.  We are fortunate to be living in the most peaceful, most prosperous, most progressive era in human history.  That may surprise young people who are watching TV or looking at your phones and it seems like only bad news comes through every day.  But consider that itâs been decades since the last war between major powers.  More people live in democracies.  Weâre wealthier and healthier and better educated, with a global economy that has lifted up more than a billion people from extreme poverty, and created new middle classes from the Americas to Africa to Asia.  Think about the health of the average person in the world -- tens of millions of lives that we now save from disease and infant mortality, and people now living longer lives.

Around the world, weâre more tolerant -- with more opportunity for women, and gays and lesbians, as we push back on bigotry and prejudice.  And around the world, thereâs a new generation of young people -- like you -- that are connected by technology, and driven by your idealism and your imagination, and you're working together to start new ventures, and to hold governments more accountable, and advance human dignity.

If you had to choose a moment in time to be born, any time in human history, and you didn't know ahead of time what nationality you were or what gender or what your economic status might be, you'd choose today -- which isn't to say that there is not still enormous suffering and enormous tragedy and so much work for us to do.  It is to remember that the trajectory of our history over the last 50, 100 years has been remarkable.  And we can't take that for granted, and we should take confidence in our ability to be able to shape our own destiny.

Now, that doesn't mean that we can be complacent because today dangerous forces do threaten to pull the world backward, and our progress is not inevitable.  These challenges threaten Europe and they threaten our transatlantic community.  We're not immune from the forces of change around the world.  As they have elsewhere, barbaric terrorists have slaughtered innocent people in Paris and Brussels, and Istanbul and San Bernardino, California.  And we see these tragedies in places central to our daily lives -- an airport or cafÃ©, a workplace or a theater -- and it unsettles us.  It makes us unsure in our day-to-day lives -- fearful not just for ourselves but those that we love.  Conflicts from South Sudan to Syria to Afghanistan have sent millions fleeing, seeking the relative safety of Europeâs shores, but that puts new strains on countries and local communities, and threatens to distort our politics.

Russian aggression has flagrantly violated the sovereignty and territory of an independent European nation, Ukraine, and that unnerves our allies in Eastern Europe, threatening our vision of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace.  And it seems to threaten the progress that's been made since the end of the Cold War.

Slow economic growth in Europe, especially in the south, has left millions unemployed, including a generation of young people without jobs and who may look to the future with diminishing hopes.  And all these persistent challenges have led some to question whether European integration can long endure; whether you might be better off separating off, redrawing some of the barriers and the laws between nations that existed in the 20th century.

Across our countries, including in the United States, a lot of workers and families are still struggling to recover from the worst economic crisis in generations.  And that trauma of millions who lost their jobs and their homes and their savings is still felt.  And meanwhile, there are profound trends underway that have been going on for decades -- globalization, automation that -- in some cases, of depressed wages, and made workers in a weaker position to bargain for better working conditions.  Wages have stagnated in many advanced countries while other costs have gone up.  Inequality has increased.  And for many people, itâs harder than ever just to hold on.

This is happening in Europe; we see some of these trends in the United States and across the advanced economies.  And these concerns and anxieties are real.  They are legitimate.  They cannot be ignored, and they deserve solutions from those in power.

Unfortunately, in the vacuum, if we do not solve these problems, you start seeing those who would try to exploit these fears and frustrations and channel them in a destructive way.  A creeping emergence of the kind of politics that the European project was founded to reject -- an âusâ versus âthemâ mentality that tries to blame our problems on the other, somebody who doesnât look like us or doesnât pray like us -- whether itâs immigrants, or Muslims, or somebody who is deemed different than us.

And you see increasing intolerance in our politics.  And loud voices get the most attention.  This reminds me of the poem by the great Irish poet W.B. Yeats, where the best lack all conviction, and the worst are full of passionate intensity.

So this is a defining moment.  And what happens on this continent has consequences for people around the globe.  If a unified, peaceful, liberal, pluralistic, free-market Europe begins to doubt itself, begins to question the progress thatâs been made over the last several decades, then we canât expect the progress that is just now taking hold in many places around the world will continue.  Instead, we will be empowering those who argue that democracy canât work, that intolerance and tribalism and organizing ourselves along ethnic lines, and authoritarianism and restrictions on the press -- that those are the things that the challenges of today demand.

So Iâve come here today, to the heart of Europe, to say that the United States, and the entire world, needs a strong and prosperous and democratic and united Europe.

Perhaps you need an outsider, somebody who is not European, to remind you of the magnitude of what you have achieved.  The progress that I described was made possible in large measure by ideals that originated on this continent in a great Enlightenment and the founding of new republics.  Of course, that progress didnât travel a straight line.  In the last century -- twice in just 30 years -- the forces of empire and intolerance and extreme nationalism consumed this continent.  And cities like this one were largely reduced to rubble.  Tens of millions of men and women and children were killed.

But from the ruins of the Second World War, our nations set out to remake the world -- to build a new international order and the institutions to uphold it.  A United Nations to prevent another world war and advance a more just and lasting peace.  International financial institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to promote prosperity for all peoples.   A Universal Declaration of Human Rights to advance the âinalienable rights of all members of the human family.â  And here in Europe, giants like Chancellor Adenauer set out to bind old adversaries through commerce and through trade.  As Adenauer said in those early days, âEuropean unity was a dream of a few.  It became a hope for [the] many.  Today it is a necessity for all of us.â

And it wasnât easy.  Old animosities had to be overcome.  National pride had to be joined with a commitment to a common good.  Complex questions of sovereignty and burden-sharing had to be answered.  Ant at every step, the impulse to pull back -- for each country to go its own way -- had to be resisted.  More than once, skeptics predicted the demise of this great project.

But the vision of European unity soldiered on -- and having defended Europeâs freedom in war, America stood with you every step of this journey.  A Marshall Plan to rebuild; an airlift to save Berlin; a NATO alliance to defend our way of life.  Americaâs commitment to Europe was captured by a young American President, John F. Kennedy, when he stood in a free West Berlin and declared that âfreedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free.â

With strength and resolve and the power of our ideals, and a belief in a unified Europe, we didnât simply end the Cold War -- freedom won.  Germany was reunited.  You welcomed new democracies into an even âever closer union.â  You may argue over whose football clubs are better, vote for different singers on Eurovision.    But your accomplishment -- more than 500 million people speaking 24 languages in 28 countries, 19 with a common currency, in one European Union -- remains one of the greatest political and economic achievements of modern times.

Yes, European unity can require frustrating compromise.  It adds layers of government that can slow decision-making.  I understand.  I've been in meetings with the European Commission.  And, as an American, we're famously disdainful of government.  We understand how easy it must be to vent at Brussels and complain.  But remember that every member of your union is a democracy.  That's not an accident.  Remember that no EU country has raised arms against another.  That's not an accident.  Remember that NATO is as strong as itâs ever been.

Remember that our market economies -- as Angela and I saw this morning -- are the greatest generators of innovation and wealth and opportunity in history.  Our freedom, our quality of life remains the envy of the world, so much so that parents are willing to walk across deserts, and cross the seas on makeshift rafts, and risk everything in the hope of giving their children the blessings that we -- that you -- enjoy -- blessings that you cannot take for granted.

This continent, in the 20th century, was at constant war.  People starved on this continent.  Families were separated on this continent.  And now people desperately want to come here precisely because of what you've created.  You can't take that for granted.

And today, more than ever, a strong, united Europe remains, as Adenauer said, a necessity for all of us.  Itâs a necessity for the United States, because Europeâs security and prosperity is inherently indivisible from our own.  We canât cut ourselves off from you.  Our economies are integrated.  Our cultures are integrated.  Our peoples are integrated.  You saw the response of the American people to Paris and Brussels -- itâs because, in our imaginations, this is our cities.

A strong, united Europe is a necessity for the world because an integrated Europe remains vital to our international order.  Europe helps to uphold the norms and rules that can maintain peace and promote prosperity around the world.

Consider what weâve done in recent years:  Pulling the global economy back from the brink of depression and putting the world on the path of recovery.  A comprehensive deal that's cut off every single one of Iranâs paths to a nuclear bomb -- part of our shared vision of a world without nuclear weapons.  In Paris, the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change.   Stopping Ebola in West Africa and saving countless lives.  Rallying the world around new sustainable development, including our goal to end extreme poverty.  None of those things could have happened if I -- if the United States did not have a partnership with a strong and united Europe.   It wouldnât have happened.

Thatâs whatâs possible when Europe and America and the world stand as one.  And thatâs precisely what we're going to need to face down the very real dangers that we face today.  So let me just lay out the kind of cooperation that we're going to need.  We need a strong Europe to bear its share of the burden, working with us on behalf of our collective security.  The United States has an extraordinary military, the best the world has ever known, but the nature of todayâs threats means we canât deal with these challenges by ourselves.

Right now, the most urgent threat to our nations is ISIL, and thatâs why weâre united in our determination to destroy it.  And all 28 NATO allies are contributing to our coalition -- whether itâs striking ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq, or supporting the air campaign, or training local forces in Iraq, or providing critical humanitarian aid.  And we continue to make progress, pushing ISIL back from territory that it controlled.

And just as Iâve approved additional support for Iraqi forces against ISIL, Iâve decided to increase U.S. support for local forces fighting ISIL in Syria.  A small number of American Special Operations Forces are already on the ground in Syria and their expertise has been critical as local forces have driven ISIL out of key areas.  So given the success, Iâve approved the deployment of up 250 additional U.S. personnel in Syria, including Special Forces, to keep up this momentum.  Theyâre not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces that continue to drive ISIL back.

So, make no mistake.  These terrorists will learn the same lesson as others before them have, which is, your hatred is no match for our nations united in the defense of our way of life.  And just as we remain relentless on the military front, weâre not going to give up on diplomacy to end the civil war in Syria, because the suffering of the Syrian people has to end, and that requires an effective political transition.

But this remains a difficult fight, and none of us can solve this problem by ourselves.  Even as European countries make important contributions against ISIL, Europe, including NATO, can still do more.  So Iâve spoken to Chancellor Merkel and Iâll be meeting later with the Presidents of France and the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and of Italy.  In Syria and Iraq, we need more nations contributing to the air campaign.  We need more nations contributing trainers to help build up local forces in Iraq.  We need more nations to contribute economic assistance to Iraq so it can stabilize liberated areas and break the cycle of violent extremism so that ISIL cannot come back.

These terrorists are doing everything in their power to strike our cities and kill our citizens, so we need to do everything in our power to stop them.  And that includes closing gaps so terrorists canât pull off attacks like those in Paris and Brussels.

Which brings me to one other point.  Europeans, like Americans, cherish your privacy.  And many are skeptical about governments collecting and sharing information, for good reason. That skepticism is healthy.  Germans remember their history of government surveillance -- so do Americans, by the way, particularly those who were fighting on behalf of civil rights.

So itâs part of our democracies to want to make sure our governments are accountable.

But I want to say this to young people who value their privacy and spend a lot of time on their phones:  The threat of terrorism is real.  In the United States, Iâve worked to reform our surveillance programs to ensure that theyâre consistent with the rule of law and upholding our values, like privacy -- and, by the way, we include the privacy of people outside of the United States.  We care about Europeansâ privacy, not just Americansâ privacy.

But I also, in working on these issues, have come to recognize security and privacy donât have to be a contradiction.  We can protect both.  And we have to.  If we truly value our liberty, then we have to take the steps that are necessary to share information and intelligence within Europe, as well as between the United States and Europe, to stop terrorists from traveling and crossing borders and killing innocent people.

And as todayâs diffuse threats evolve, our alliance has to evolve.  So weâre going to have a NATO summit this summer in Warsaw, and I will insist that all of us need to meet our responsibilities, united, together.  That means standing with the people of Afghanistan as they build their security forces and push back against violent extremism.  It means more ships in the Aegean to shut down criminal networks who are profiting by smuggling desperate families and children.

And that said, NATOâs central mission is, and always will be, our solemn duty -- our Article 5 commitment to our common defense.  Thatâs why weâll continue to bolster the defense of our frontline allies in Poland and Romania and the Baltic states.

So we have to both make sure that NATO carries out its traditional mission, but also to meet the threats of NATOâs southern flank.  Thatâs why we need to stay nimble, and make sure our forces are interoperable, and invest in new capabilities like cyber defense and missile defense.  And thatâs why every NATO member should be contributing its full share -- 2 percent of GDP -- towards our common security, something that doesnât always happen.  And Iâll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense.

Just as we stand firm in our own defense, we have to uphold our most basic principles of our international order, and thatâs a principle that nations like Ukraine have the right to choose their own destiny.  Remember that it was Ukrainians on the Maidan, many of them your age, reaching out for a future with Europe that prompted Russia to send in its military.  After all that Europe endured in the 20th century, we must not allow borders to be redrawn by brute force in the 21st century.  So we should keep helping Ukraine with its reforms to improve its economy and consolidate its democracy and modernize its forces to protect its independence.

And I want good relations with Russia, and have invested a lot in good relations with Russia.  But we need to keep sanctions on Russia in place until Russia fully implements the Minsk agreements that Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande and others have worked so hard to maintain, and provide a path for a political resolution of this issue.  And ultimately, it is my fervent hope that Russia recognizes that true greatness comes not from bullying neighbors, but by working with the world, which is the only way to deliver lasting economic growth and progress to the Russian people.

Now, our collective security rests on a foundation of prosperity, so that brings me to my second point.  The world needs a prosperous and growing Europe -- not just a strong Europe, but a prosperous and growing Europe that generates good jobs and wages for its people.

As I mentioned before, the economic anxieties many feel today on both sides of the Atlantic are real.  The disruptive changes brought about by the global economy, unfortunately, sometimes are hitting certain groups, especially working-class communities, more heavily.  And if neither the burdens, nor the benefits of our global economy are being fairy distributed, itâs no wonder that people rise up and reject globalization.  If there are too few winners and too many losers as the global economy integrates, people are going to push back.

So all of us in positions of power have a responsibility as leaders of government and business and civil society to help people realize the promise of economic and security in this integrated economy.  And the good news is, we know how to do it.  Sometimes we just lack the political will to do it.

In the United States, our economy is growing again, but the United States canât be the sole engine of global growth.  And countries should not have to choose between responding to crises and investing in their people.  So we need to pursue reforms to position us for long-term prosperity, and support demand and invest in the future.  All of our countries, for example, could be investing more in infrastructure.  All of our countries need to invest in science and research and development that sparks new innovation and new industries.  All of our countries have to invest in our young people, and make sure that they have the skills and the training and the education they need to adapt to this rapidly changing world.  All of our countries need to worry about inequality, and make sure that workers are getting a fair share of the incredible productivity that technology and global supply chains are producing.

But if youâre really concerned about inequality, if youâre really concerned about the plight of workers, if youâre a progressive, itâs my firm belief that you canât turn inward.  Thatâs not the right answer.   We have to keep increasing the trade and investment that supports jobs, as weâre working to do between the United States and the EU.  We need to keep implementing reforms to our banking and financial systems so that the excesses and abuses that triggered the financial crisis never happen again.

But we canât do that individually, nation by nation, because finance now is transnational.  It moves around too fast.  If weâre not coordinating between Europe and the United States and Asia, then it wonât work.

As the world has been reminded in recent weeks, we need to close loopholes that allow corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes through tax havens and tax avoidance, trillions of dollars that could be going towards pressing needs like education and health care and infrastructure.  But to do that, we have to work together.

Here in Europe, as you work to strengthen your union -- including through labor and banking reforms, and by ensuring growth across the Eurozone -- you will have the staunch support of the United States.  But youâre going to have to do it together, because your economies are too integrated to try to solve these problems on your own.  And I want to repeat:  We have to confront the injustice of widening economic inequality. But that is going to require collective work, because capital is mobile, and if only a few countries are worrying about it, then a lot of businesses will head toward places that donât care about it quite as much.

For a lot of years, it was thought that countries had to choose between economic growth and economic inclusion.  Now we know the truth -- when wealth is increasingly concentrated among the few at the top, itâs not only a moral challenge to us but it actually drags down a countryâs growth potential.  We need growth that is broad and lifts everybody up.  We need tax policies that do right by working families.

And those like me who support European unity and free trade also have a profound responsibility to champion strong protections for workers -- a living wage and the right to organize, and a strong safety net, and a commitment to protect consumers and the environment upon which we all depend.  If we really want to reduce inequality, we've got to make sure everyone who works hard gets a fair shot -- and that's especially true for young people like you -- with education, and job training, and quality health care and good wages.  And that includes, by the way, making sure that there's equal pay for equal work for women.

The point is, we have to reform many of our economies.  But the answer to reform is not to start cutting ourselves off from each other.  Rather, it's to work together.  And this brings me back to where I began.  The world depends upon a democratic Europe that upholds the principles of pluralism and diversity and freedom that are our common creed.  As free peoples, we cannot allow the forces that Iâve described -- fears about security or economic anxieties -- to undermine our commitment to the universal values that are the source of our strength.

Democracy, I understand, can be messy.  It can be slow.  It can be frustrating.  I know that.  I have to deal with a Congress.    We have to constantly work to make sure government is not a collection of distant, detached institutions, but is connected and responsive to the everyday concerns of our people.  There's no doubt that how a united Europe works together can be improved.  But look around the world -- at authoritarian governments and theocracies that rule by fear and oppression -- there is no doubt that democracy is still the most just and effective form of government ever created.

And when I talk about democracy, I don't just mean elections, because there are a number of countries where people get 70, 80 percent of the vote, but they control all the media and the judiciary.  And civil society organizations and NGOs can't organize, and have to be registered, and are intimidated.  I mean real democracy, the sort that we see here in Europe and in the United States.  So we have to be vigilant in defense of these pillars of democracy -- not just elections, but rule of law, as well as fair elections, a free press, vibrant civil societies where citizens can work for change.

And we should be suspicious of those who claim to have the interests of Europe at heart and yet don't practice the very values that are essential to Europe, that have made freedom in Europe so real.

So, yes, these are unsettling times.  And when the future is uncertain, there seems to be an instinct in our human nature to withdraw to the perceived comfort and security of our own tribe, our own sect, our own nationality, people who look like us, sound like us.  But in today's world, more than any time in human history, that is a false comfort.  It pits people against one another because of what they look or how they pray or who they love.  And yet, we know where that kind of twisted thinking can lead.  It can lead to oppression.  It can lead to segregation and internment camps.  And to the Shoah and Srebrenica.

In the United States, weâve long wrestled with questions of race and integration, and we do to this day.  And we still have a lot of work to do.  But our progress allows somebody like me to now stand here as President of the United States.  That's because we committed ourselves to a larger ideal, one based on a creed -- not a race, not a nationality -- a set of principles; truths that we held to be self-evident that all men were created equal.  And now, as Europe confronts questions of immigration and religion and assimilation, I want you to remember that our countries are stronger, they are more secure and more successful when we welcome and integrate people of all backgrounds and faith, and make them feel as one.  And that includes our fellow citizens who are Muslim.

Look, the sudden arrival of so many people from beyond our borders, especially when their cultures are very different, that can be daunting.  We have immigration issues in the United States as well, along our southern border of the United States and from people arriving from all around the world who get a visa and decide they want to stay.  And I know the politics of immigration and refugees is hard.  It's hard everywhere, in every country.  And just as a handful of neighborhoods shouldn't bear all the burden of refugee resettlement, neither should any one nation.  All of us have to step up, all of us have to share this responsibility.  That includes the United States.

But even as we take steps that are required to ensure our security; even as we help Turkey and Greece cope with this influx in a way that is safe and humane; even as Chancellor Merkel and other European leaders work for an orderly immigration and resettlement process, rather than a disorderly one; even as we all need to collectively do more to invest in the sustainable development and governance in those nations from which people are fleeing so that they can succeed and prosper in their own countries, and so that we can reduce the conflicts that cause so much of the refugee crisis around the world -- Chancellor Merkel and others have eloquently reminded us that we cannot turn our backs on our fellow human beings who are here now, and need our help now.   We have to uphold our values, not just when itâs easy, but when itâs hard.

In Germany, more than anywhere else, we learned that what the world needs is not more walls.  We can't define ourselves by the barriers we build to keep people out or to keep people in.  At every crossroads in our history, we've moved forward when we acted on those timeless ideals that tells us to be open to one another, and to respect the dignity of every human being.

And I think of so many Germans and people across Europe who have welcomed migrants into their homes, because, as one woman in Berlin said, âwe needed to do something.â  Just that human impulse to help.  And I think of the refugee who said, âI want to teach my kids the value of working.â  That human impulse to see the next generation have hope.  All of us can be guided by the empathy and compassion of His Holiness, Pope Francis, who said ârefugees are not numbers, they are people who have faces, names, stories, and [they] need to be treated as such.â 

And I know it may seem easy for me to say all this, living on the other side of the ocean.  And I know that some will call it blind hope when I say that I am confident that the forces that bind Europe together are ultimately much stronger than those trying to pull you apart.  But hope is not blind when it is rooted in the memory of all that you've already overcome -- your parents, your grandparents.

So I say to you, the people of Europe, don't forget who you are.  You are the heirs to a struggle for freedom.  You're the Germans, the French, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Luxembourgers, the Italians -- and yes, the British -- who rose above old divisions and put Europe on the path to union.

Youâre the Poles of Solidarity and the Czechs and Slovaks who waged a Velvet Revolution.  Youâre the Latvians, and Lithuanians and Estonians who linked hands in a great human chain of freedom.  Youâre the Hungarians and Austrians who cut through borders of barbed wire.  And youâre the Berliners who, on that November night, finally tore down that wall.  Youâre the people of Madrid and London who faced down bombings and refused to give in to fear.

And you are the Parisians who, later this year, plan to reopen the Bataclan.  Youâre the people of Brussels, in a square of flowers and flags, including one Belgian who offered a message -- we need âmore.â  More understanding.  More dialogue.  More humanity.

That's who you are.  United, together.  You are Europe -- âUnited in diversity.â   Guided by the ideals that have lit the world, and stronger when you stand as one.

As you go forward, you can be confident that your greatest ally and friend, the United States of America, stands with you, shoulder-to-shoulder, now and forever.  Because a united Europe -- once the dream of a few -- remains the hope of the many and a necessity for us all.

Thank you very much.  Thank you.
","President Barack Obama made an emphatic pitch for international trade dealsduring a visit to this German city Sunday, as he and Chancellor Angela Merkel tried to lift momentum for a trans-Atlantic agreement that is facing resistance in both countries.

The two leaders called on negotiators to move forward with the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, saying the window to strike a deal soon could close.

Amid skepticism in the U.S. and criticism from Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, Mr. Obama touted what he called the indisputable benefits of international trade and called for completing the accord with Europe before the end of the year.

""We've now been negotiating TTIP for three years. We have made important progress. But time is not on our side,"" Mr. Obama said in a speech at an industrial-technology trade fair here. ""If we don't complete negotiations this year, then upcoming political transitions -- in the United States and Europe -- could mean this agreement won't be finished for quite some time.""

Negotiations for the sweeping agreement, which would include the U.S. and the 28 member states of the European Union, have progressed slowly. Critics fear the deal could weaken regulations protecting consumers, labor and the environment. Mr. Obama said Sunday the aim is to strengthen standards while eliminating ""regulatory and bureaucratic irritants and blockages to trade.""

While the president aimed to build support for TTIP during his two-day visit, he also sought to boost a friend under fire, praising Ms. Merkel's openness to accepting refugees and vowing to work together on a range of security and economic issues.

The chancellor has faced a backlash at home for welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Syria and other war-torn areas.

Mr. Obama lauded her willingness to take on tough issues, saying that she is ""on the right side of history on this."" He also praised the EU migration deal with Turkey that she brokered last month.

After stops in Saudi Arabia and London, Mr. Obama arrived in Germany Sunday for talks with Ms. Merkel and to attend the industrial trade fair, called Hannover Messe.

On Monday, they will be joined by British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to tackle issues including Syria, Libya, migration and Islamic State.

After meeting with Ms. Merkel, Mr. Obama continued to express confidence that the U.S. and its European partners could completethe trans-Atlantic trade deal, while acknowledging that there is a higher degree of difficulty during an election year. He said people around the world are feeling unsettled by globalization even though international trade strengthens the economy.

""People visibly see a plant moving and jobs lost, and the narrative develops that this is weakening rather than strengthening the position of ordinary people and ordinary workers,"" Mr. Obama said following discussions with Ms. Merkel. ""That, I think, is what drives a lot of suspicion, understandably, of these trade deals.""

He said later, during remarks at the trade fair, that the politics of trade are difficult, ""but we have to keep making our case."" Ms. Merkel pointed to a limited time frame in which the trade deal could be negotiated.

In the U.S., presidential candidates in both parties have expressed opposition to the trade deals the president has pursued, raising questions about the agreements' prospects once Mr. Obama leaves office. The skeptics include Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Mr. Obama's former secretary of state, who once supported a separate Pacific pact but now opposes it.

Mr. Obama predicted trade deals would find a warmer reception after election season. Ms. Merkel declined to weigh in on U.S. politics, even though Republican front-runner Donald Trump has had much to say about her, calling her welcoming of migrants ""insane.""

""First, I'm concentrating fully on the challenges of the year 2016, which I'm rather filled up with,"" she said in response to a question about Mr. Trump's criticism of NATO and her refugee policy. ""Second, I'm observing with interest the American election campaign.""

The two leaders said they also discussed tenuous cease-fires in Ukraine and Syria, and the need to put pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to push to scale back violence in both.
","President Obama said on Sunday that he was confident the United States and the European Union would succeed in negotiating a new trans-Atlantic trade deal by the end of the year, saying the benefits of such an agreement were ""indisputable.""

Mr. Obama said images of factories moving overseas and lost jobs created a narrative about trade agreements that ""drives, understandably, a lot of suspicion"" in places like the United States and Germany. But, he added, well-designed trade deals can have greater benefits.

""It is indisputable that it has made our economy stronger,"" he said. ""It has made sure that our businesses are the most competitive in the world.""

Mr. Obama spoke while standing next to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at a news conference in Hanover as they prepared to preside over the opening here of the world's largest industrial trade fair.

In the evening, Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel hosted a dinner for 29 chief executives of major American and German companies.

The president's visit to Germany was intended to bolster negotiators seeking to wrap up a trade agreement between the United States and the European Union, an accord that Ms. Merkel supports but that is highly unpopular in her country.

Ms. Merkel is among Mr. Obama's most trusted counterparts, and the president is eager to support her during difficult political times. Ms. Merkel has struggled in recent months to confront a surge of migrants and a weakening economy.

On Sunday, she echoed Mr. Obama's enthusiasm for the trans-Atlantic trade deal, using bolder language than is her usual style.

""We should get a move on,"" the chancellor said. ""We all know the reproaches, worries and fears, and what difficulties remain.""

But if time is used wisely, she said, an agreement that will raise living standards can emerge. ""So my request to those who are present,"" she added, looking around the audience of hundreds of business leaders and politicians, is: ""Do it, and then we can have a great success this year.""

The chancellor greeted the president at the Schloss Herrenhausen, the former summer residence of the Royal House of Hanover. They stood in front of a line of German troops in gray overcoats and green berets as the national anthems of the two nations played before the two leaders returned inside for a private meeting.

Mr. Obama said he hoped the trade negotiations could be completed before he left office.

""I don't anticipate that we will be able to complete ratification of a deal by the end of this year, but I do anticipate that we will have completed the agreement,"" he said. Once negotiations are finished, he said, ""people will be able to see exactly why this will be good for our two countries.""

Yet even as he expressed confidence that a deal would be reached this year, Mr. Obama acknowledged that ""time is not on our side,"" and he offered a thinly veiled warning that a deal could be doomed if politicians like Hillary Clinton, who opposes the accord, are elected this year.

""If we don't complete negotiations this year, then upcoming political transitions in the United States and Europe could mean this agreement won't be finished for quite some time,"" Mr. Obama said, not mentioning Mrs. Clinton, his former secretary of state, directly.

Earlier, Mr. Obama's commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, told an audience of 350 business leaders, ""We must ask ourselves: What is the cost of delay?""

""Now is the time for U.S.-German leadership,"" she said.

Yet Germans often veer between admiration and scorn of the United States. Rarely was that more clear than in the contrasting ways that two groups prepared to greet Mr. Obama here this weekend.

Undeterred by the scandal caused by Volkswagen's deceit about emissions from its diesel vehicles in the United States, Germany's export-driven businesses showed off their wares in eager anticipation of the fair's opening on Sunday and the first visit to this city by a sitting American president. Mr. Obama helped open the fair.

Mr. Obama kindled good will with an unusually glowing appraisal of Ms. Merkel, telling Germany's best-selling newspaper, Bild, that he was proud to call her a friend. In particular, he praised Ms. Merkel's ""real political and moral leadership"" in welcoming more than a million migrants last year.

None of that impressed the tens of thousands of protesters who gathered in Hanover's Opera Square on Saturday. Their goal, as proclaimed in hundreds of banners and chants, was to topple the trade deal, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

Germany depends on exports for its wealth and on the United States for its security. Yet many Germans do not see the trade agreement as a good thing.

Monica Orth, 54, a therapist for teenagers who lives in Bonn, is one of many here who see the trade pact as a plot by big businesses -- often American ones -- to lower consumer standards, bypass national justice systems and undermine Europe's way of life.

""I don't want Monsanto and Bayer to determine which seeds I eat,"" Ms. Orth said. As two friends nodded in agreement, she added, ""Democracy is a really valuable thing, and I don't want big business to take that from me.""

At least a dozen other protesters who were interviewed echoed her words. All accused corporations like Monsanto -- the American biotechnology corporation reviled by some for using genetically modified seeds that it says help battle disease -- or the German pharmaceutical company Bayer of trying to force on them products they do not want.

In a way, these Germans should be a source of American pride, fierce believers in the democratic creed that the Western Allies spread after the defeat of the Nazis.

Yet popular sentiment in Germany often turns against the United States, which, though admired for its liberty and technical prowess, is also mistrusted by many for its commercial and military dominance.

""Anti-Americanism plays a certain role"" in the opposition to the trade accord, said Christian Bluth, a researcher at Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German research institute that recently commissioned a poll suggesting even stronger rejection of the deal than the latest survey by ZDF, a public-service television broadcaster, which found in mid-February that at least half of Germans opposed the proposed trade agreement.

""What I personally find very difficult to understand is why Germans are so full of fears about trade and the future at a time when they have it good and unemployment is relatively low,"" Mr. Bluth said in an interview.

Anton Hofreiter, a leader of the Greens party who observed the protest on Saturday, said anti-American beliefs were not the guiding force of the campaign against the trade pact. Yet he noted that demonstrators were wary that Mr. Obama had come to Europe partly to make a quick trade deal.

Protesters who were asked why they so feared a pact likely to enhance Germany's trade prospects or why they distrusted American regulators, who uncovered the Volkswagen scandal when European regulators did not, insisted that they would be deceived, describing the trade talks as secretive.

As a leading commentator, Nico Fried, noted in the newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung on Saturday, ""It sometimes seems easier to get the conflicting parties in Syria to agree on peace than for the friendly trans-Atlantic partners to produce a trade agreement.""

94,94,2016-05-06-FlintWaterCrisis.txt,"All right.  Let me do some businessing.  Let me begin by recognizing some of the guests who are here.  Your mayor, Karen Weaver, is here.   I know Governor Rick Snyder is here.

No, no -- because here's here to -- we're doing some business here. Members of Congress are here, including your outstanding senator, Debbie Stabenow.  Flint's own Dan Kildee is here.  Debbie Dingell is here.    Brenda Lawrence is here.  John Conyers is here.  And Sandy Levin.  An outstanding Michigan delegation.  We've got Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who is the head of Health and Human Services, works for me. And Administrator Gina McCarthy is here, as well.  I want to thank Superintendent Bilal Tawwab -- and Principal Tim Green for their hospitality.  And I want to thank all of you for being here.

Now, not too long ago, I received a letter from a young lady, an eight-year-old girl named Mari Copeny.  You may know her as ""Little Miss Flint.""

Those of you who have seats, please feel free to sit down so folks can see behind you.  If you don't have a seat, don't sit down.

And like a lot of you, Mari has been worried about what happened here in Flint.  She's worried about what it means for children like her.  She's worried about the future of this city and this community.

So in the middle of a tragedy that should have never happened here in the United States of America -- the denial of something as basic as clean, safe drinking water -- this eight-year-old girl spoke out and marched and, like many of you, protested.  As Mari was getting ready to hop on a bus to Washington, she wrote to ask if she could meet with me while she was in town.  There she is.

Now, I would have been happy to see Mari in Washington.  But when something like this happens, a young girl shouldn't have to go to Washington to be heard.  I thought her President should come to Flint to meet with her.    And that's why I'm here -- to tell you directly that I see you and I hear you, and I want to hear directly from you about how this public health crisis has disrupted your lives, how it's made you angry, how it's made you worried.

And I just had a chance to meet with a few of your neighbors in a roundtable discussion, and I heard from them what I know a lot of you are feeling:  That a lot of you are scared.  That all of you feel let down. And I told them that I understood why you'd be afraid -- not just for yourselves, but for your kids.

I also wanted to come here, though, to tell you that I've got your back -- that we're paying attention.  So I met and heard directly from those who are leading the federal response and who are working hard to make sure that Flint is whole again, to make sure that this proud city bounces back not just to where it was, but stronger than ever.  And I want all of you to know I am confident that Flint will come back.    I will not rest, and I'm going to make sure that the leaders, at every level of government, don't rest until every drop of water that flows to your homes is safe to drink and safe to cook with, and safe to bathe in -- because that's part of the basic responsibilities of a government in the United States of America.

So as President, I've sent Flint the best resources our federal government has to support our state and local partners.  The agencies that serve you -- the agencies that specialize in health and housing, and those that support small businesses and our kids' education; those that are responsible for the food that our children eat and, of course, the water we drink. Everybody is on duty.  The National Guard is on duty.  This is a hands-on-deck situation -- all hands on deck.  Because if there's a child who feels neglected on the north side of Flint, or a family on the east side of this city who wonders whether they should give up on their hometown and move away, or an immigrant who wonders whether America means what we say about being a place where we take care of our own.  That matters to all of us -- not just in Flint, not just in Michigan, but all across America.  Flint's recovery is everybody's responsibility.    And I'm going to make sure that responsibility is met.

So I just talked with some of the team of responders that are on the ground to make sure that they're coordinating.  And they're doing some incredible things.  They've distributed enough water to fill more than three Olympic-sized swimming pools.  They've distributed thousands of filters.  They're helping students afford nutritious food that work against the contaminants in bad water.  They're making sure new moms have access to instant infant formula that doesn't require water.  They've expanded health services for children and pregnant women, and education programs for Flint's youngest children.  They're out there testing homes for lead and testing children for exposure to lead.

But like all our best responses in tough times, this is not a government effort alone.  We need our businesses and nonprofits and philanthropies to step up.  And what's incredible about Flint is how many volunteers have already been leading the way.    You've got members of one union, UA Local 370, that have donated tens of thousands of dollars and 10,000 hours of their time.  They've installed thousands of filters, hundreds of faucets by going door to door, night and day.  They're not asking for anything in return, they're just doing the right thing.

So many Americans, here in Flint and around the country, have proven that you don't have be a plumber or a pipefitter to pitch in -- although it's very helpful if you're a plumber or pipefitter.  So, in March, dozens of accountants teamed up with the American Red Cross to help residents recycle all the plastic water bottles that have been piling up.  Religious and community groups are organizing supply drives, supporting families, offering free medical services.

The director of a local dance studio, I understand, found a creative way to help; she's letting people use her studio as a space to support one another by sharing their stories and realizing they're not alone.  Even inmates at an Indiana prison came together to donate more than $2,500 to the people of Flint.   And a second-grader from Virginia, a young man named Isiah Britt, set up a website to see if he could raise $500 for hand sanitizers to send to the kids at Eisenhower Elementary here in Flint.   So Isiah, it's fair to say, surpassed his goal, because he raised $15,000.    And he explained that the experience taught him just because you're small ""doesn't mean you can't do big things.""

So when you think of all those stories, it should be clear that the American people care about Flint.  The American people are paying attention and they care about you.  And as is true when disasters strike in other ways, people pitch in, they come together.  Because they imagine, ""All right, that could have been me.""  That's the good news.

The bad news is that this should not have happened in the first place.   And even though the scope of the response looks sort of like the efforts we're used to seeing after a natural disaster, that's not what this was. This was a manmade disaster.  This was avoidable.  This was preventable.

Now, I'm not here to go through the full history of what happened.  Like a lot of manufacturing towns, Flint's economy has been taking hits for decades now -- plants closing, jobs moving away.  Manufacturing has shrunk.  And that's made it harder for the city to maintain city services.  And let's face it, government officials at every level weren't attentive to potential problems the way they should have been.  So they start getting short-staffed, they start getting a shrinking tax base, more demand for services.  Things start getting strained, and there's not enough help from the outside.  And then when Flint's finances collapsed, an emergency manager was put in place whose mandate was primarily to cut at all costs.  And then some very poor decisions were made.  All these things contributed to this crisis.  Many of you know the story.

Now, I do not believe that anybody consciously wanted to hurt the people in Flint.  And this is not the place to sort out every screw-up that resulted in contaminated water.  But I do think there is a larger issue that we have to acknowledge, because I do think that part of what contributed to this crisis was a broader mindset, a bigger attitude, a corrosive attitude that exists in our politics and exists in too many levels of our government.

And it's a mindset that believes that less government is the highest good no matter what.  It's a mindset that says environmental rules designed to keep your water clean or your air clean are optional, or not that important, or unnecessarily burden businesses or taxpayers.  It's an ideology that undervalues the common good, says we're all on our own and what's in it for me, and how do I do well, but I'm not going to invest in what we need as a community.  And, as a consequence, you end up seeing an underinvestment in the things that we all share that make us safe, that make us whole, that give us the ability to pursue our own individual dreams.  So we underinvest in pipes underground.  We underinvest in bridges that we drive on, and the roads that connect us, and the schools that move us forward.

And this is part of the attitude, this is part of the mindset:  We especially underinvest when the communities that are put at risk are poor, or don't have a lot of political clout -- and so are not as often heard in the corridors of power.

And this kind of thinking -- this myth that government is always the enemy; that forgets that our government is us -- it's us; that it's an extension of us, ourselves -- that attitude is as corrosive to our democracy as the stuff that resulted in lead in your water.  Because what happens is it leads to systematic neglect.  It leads to carelessness and callousness.    It leads to a lot of hidden disasters that you don't always read about and aren't as flashy, but that over time diminish the life of a community and make it harder for our young people to succeed.

In one of the roundtables, I was listening to somebody -- I think it was a pastor who told me, you know, it made us feel like we didn't count.  And you can't have a democracy where people feel like they don't count, where people feel like they're not heard.

And that attitude ignores how this country was built, our entire history -- which is based on the idea that we're all connected and that what happens in a community like Flint matters everybody, and that there are things that we can only do together, as a nation, as a people, as a state, as a city that no man is an island.

We've been debating this since the Republic began:  What are our individual responsibilities and what are our collective responsibilities.  And that's a good debate.  But I've always believed what the first Republican President, a guy named Abraham Lincoln, said.  He said we should do individually those things that we do best by ourselves.  But through our government, we should do together what we can't do as well for ourselves.

So it doesn't matter how hard you work, how responsible you are, or how well you raise your kids -- you can't set up a whole water system for a city.  That's not something you do by yourself.  You do it with other people.  You can't hire your own fire department, or your own police force, or your own army.  There are things we have to do together -- basic things that we all benefit from.

And that's how we invested in a rail system and a highway system. That's how we invested in public schools.  That's how we invested in science and research.  These how we invested in community colleges and land grant colleges like Michigan State.

Can I get some water?    Come on up here.  Give me some water.  I want a glass of water.  I want a glass of water.  Sit down.  I'm all right.  I'm going to get a glass of water right here.  Let's make sure we find one.  It will be filtered.  Hold on, I'm going to talk about that in a second.  Settle down, everybody.

Where was I?  We invested in our communities and our cities.  And by making those investments in the common good, we invested in ourselves. That's the platform we create that allows each of us independently to succeed.  That's what made America great.

So the people in Flint, and across Michigan, and around the country -- individuals and church groups and non-for-profits and community organizations -- you've proven that the American people will step up when required.  And our volunteers, our non-for-profits, they're the lifeblood of our communities.  We so appreciate what you do.

But volunteers don't build county water systems and keep lead from leaching into our drinking glasses.  We can't rely on faith groups to reinforce bridges and repave runways at the airport.  We can't ask second-graders, even ones as patriotic as Isiah Britt who raised all that money, to raise enough money to keep our kids healthy.

You hear a lot about government overreach, how Obama -- he's for big government.  Listen, it's not government overreach to say that our government is responsible for making sure you can wash your hands in your own sink, or shower in your own home, or cook for your family.   These are the most basic services.  There is no more basic element sustaining human life than water.  It's not too much to expect for all Americans that their water is going to be safe.

Now, where do we go from here?

Well, I'm still waiting for my water.  Somebody obviously didn't hear me. Usually I get my water pretty quick.  Hold on a second.

Now, the reason I know I'm okay is because I already had some Flint water.  There we go.  I really did need a glass of water.  This is not a stunt.

Now, I'm going to talk about this.  Everybody settle down.  This is a feisty crowd.  Hold on a second.  All right, everybody settle down.  I got some serious points to make here.

So where do we go from here?  Now, Mayor Weaver has a plan to fix the pipes in Flint.  And unfortunately, because the state initially cut so many corners, it's going to end up being more expensive -- much more expensive now than it would have been to avert the disaster in the first place.  But the good news is that Michigan does have funds it can use from the federal government to help Flint.  The Governor indicated that in his budget he has put forward additional funds to replace the pipes.  In order for it to happen -- and I said this to the Mayor and the Governor; I had them both in my car, the Beast -- I told them I wasn't going to let either of them out until we figured this out.    I had Secret Service surrounding everybody.

But what I said was, is that the city and the state and the federal government, everybody is going to have to work together to get this done.  So it's not going to happen overnight.  But we have to get started.  We have to get the money flowing.  We've got to work with our plumbers and pipefitters, but also train local residents and start getting apprenticeship programs going -- so that even as we're trying to deal with this disaster, we're also hopefully lifting people up and giving them an opportunity for employment.    Congress, led by your congressional delegation, needs to act in a bipartisan fashion, do their job, make sure Flint has the necessary resources.

And so it's long past time that Flint has a well-managed, monitored, modern water system that protects not just against lead, but other contaminants.  All right?  So that's our goal.  That's one goal.

But we've got to do more than just ensure the integrity and safety of your water for the long term.  What we also have to do is work as one team -- federal, state, and local leaders, Democrats and Republicans -- to address some of the broader issues that have been raised by this crisis.  The federal officials I met with today are committed to staying on the job until we get it done.    But that requires the state of Michigan to step up and be fully invested in this process, as well.    Today's vote in Lansing to increase funding for health care was a good start.

But part of keeping the faith with the people of Flint means making sure that you're first in line for the jobs this effort will create.    It means that since the state voted this afternoon to expand Medicaid, every child who lived in Flint while the water was bad needs to be able to get seen by a doctor, diagnosed, make sure that there's follow-up.  We can't just promise it, we've got to deliver it.  And that means everybody has got to cooperate.  Everybody has got to cooperate.

And keeping the faith with you also means the state has to step up and deliver the resources that will help not only fix the water, but transform Flint so that it is once again a functioning city with the capacity and the democratic structures to work.  The city government has to be on a firm foundation.  The mayor can't do it by herself.  She's got to have a team and a staff, and there's got to be a budget that works, that's sustainable, and a plan for long-term economic development, and a plan to make sure that health care is available to all of our kids, and a plan to make sure that education is top-notch in this city, and that more jobs are being created.    And that will require many more of the good work that we've seen from citizens and community groups who care about your families.

But it's not enough just to fix the water.  We've got to fix the culture of neglect, the mindset I was talking about -- that has degraded too many schools and too many roads and hurt too many futures.  We've got to fix the mindset that only leaves people cynical about our government.  Our government is us -- of us, by us, for us -- the people.

So we've got a lot of work to do.  But I'm here to tell you I'm prepared to work with you on this.  I'm paying attention.

Now, a couple of specific things I want to address.  These aren't in my prepared remarks, but this is what I gathered from the conversations that I had.

I'm in Flint right now, not Detroit.  But I do love Detroit.  And their school needs support, and there is -- some of that same mindset has hurt the schools there.

But listen up, because this is drawn from the conversations I had with many of your neighbors and friends, as well as the federal response teams that I sent out here a while back.  We're going to do everything we can to accelerate getting new pipes here in Flint.    But even with all the money, even with an efficient, speeded-up process, it's going to take a while for all the pipes to be replaced.  It's not going to happen next month.  It's not going to happen six months from now, where all the pipes in Flint are going to be replaced.  We've got to get started, and you need to see that it's getting started and that progress is being made.  But it's not going to happen overnight.  Even if we get all the plumbers and pipefitters, and we get some more apprentices trained -- even if we do all that, it's going to take some time.

And so one of the things I heard talking to a lot of your neighbors is, boy, right now it's rough just trying to figure out how to get bottled water on the way home from work, and you're trying to just shower real quick, and people are still concerned about what's safe and what information is correct and what is not.  So I do want to just tell you what I know, based on not just what I've been reading in the papers, but what our top scientists have told me.

The first is that while you are waiting to get your pipes replaced, you need to have a filter installed, and use that filter.  And if you do use that filter, then the water is safe to consume for children over the age of six and who are not pregnant.

Now, hold on a second.  Don't just start shouting, okay?  Because this is the problem -- we're going to have to solve this problem.  And if people don't listen to each other, then it's not going to get fixed.

So I'm telling you -- and I promise you, I'm really good at stirring folks up.  So if I want to just come here and stir folks up, I know how to do that.  But that's not actually going to solve the problem, all right?  So I'm telling what I know, because I guarantee you that the scientists who work for me, if they tell me something -- which I'm saying in front of all those cameras -- turns out to be wrong, that person will not have a job.

So although I understand the fear and concern that people have, and it is entirely legitimate, what the science tells us at this stage is you should not drink any of the water that is not filtered.  But if you get the filter and use it properly, that water can be consumed.  That's point number one.

And you can get those filters free, and people will help install them if you need help -- particularly seniors who may have trouble going back and forth and trying to get a whole bunch of bottles of water and so forth.  So that's information that I trust and I believe.  That's point number one.

Point number two:  Every child in Flint who may have consumed water during the course of this tragedy -- and that is the overwhelming majority of children here -- should get checked.

Now, the reason that's important is because lead is a serious issue.  And if undiagnosed and not dealt with, it can lead to some long-term problems.  But -- and this is really important, so I want everybody to pay attention -- if you know that your child may have been exposed and you go to a health clinic, a doctor, a provider, and are working with them, then your child will be fine.  And the reason I can say that with some confidence is not just based on science, but based on the fact that keep in mind that it wasn't until the â80s where we started banning lead in paint, lead in toys, lead in gasoline.  So if you are my age, or older, or maybe even a little bit younger, you got some lead in your system when you were growing up.  You did.  I am sure that somewhere, when I was two years old, I was taking a chip of paint, tasting it, and I got some lead.  Or sometimes toys were painted with lead, and you were chewing on them.

Now, I say that not to make light of the situation.  We know now what we didn't know then, which is it can cause problems if children get exposed to lead at elevated levels.  But the point is that as long as kids are getting good health care, and folks are paying attention, and they're getting a good education, and they have community support, and they're getting some good home training, and they are in a community that is loving and nurturing and thriving, these kids will be fine.  And I don't want anybody to start thinking that somehow all the kids in Flint are going to have problems for the rest of their lives, because that's not true.  That is not true.     And I don't want that stigma to be established in the minds of kids.

We've learned a lot of things since I was a kid.  I used to have adults blowing smoke in my face all the time.    We didn't use seat belts.  We wrapped dry-cleaning bags around us and thought that was funny.    Folks didn't know.  No, no, but the reason I think this is important is because I heard from a lot of folks who were saying how moms and dads were feeling guilty.  They're feeling sad.  They're feeling depressed.  Oh, Lord, what's -- how is this going to affect my child.  And it's right to be angry.  But you can't get passive.  You can't just suddenly sit back and sink into despair.  Our kids will be fine, but you have to now take action.  Don't wait for somebody else to reach out and ask whether your child has gotten a checkup recently.  We just expanded Medicaid.  Go take your child to that doctor.   Use that health system.

And so community organizations, churches, et cetera, one of the things that we need to do is -- and I've talked to the Governor and the Mayor about this -- is set up a system of outreach so that we're getting everybody as a village looking out for every child, making sure that they're getting checked up, making sure they've got pediatric care, making sure they're being tested effectively, making sure then that they're getting nutritious food.

Just to give you an example, we know that if kids are getting vegetables and eating properly -- that, just by itself, is going to have some impact on any effects of lead.  But I know that here in Flint there are whole neighborhoods that don't even have a supermarket.  So we're going to have to figure out how to get supermarkets in those communities.    And in the meantime, we got to help make sure that those kids are getting the nutrition they need.

So I say all this just to indicate you should be angry, but channel that anger.  You should be hurt, but don't sink into despair.  And most of all, do not somehow communicate to our children here in this city that they're going to be saddled with problems for the rest of their lives.  Because they will not.    They'll do just fine, just like I did fine with a single mom, and a lot of you did fine growing up in a tough neighborhood.  They'll make it as long as we're there for them and looking after them, and doing the right thing for them and giving them the resources that they need.  Don't lose hope.  Don't lose hope.

I talked longer than I was going to.    But I feel strongly about this whole issue with kids now.  Kids rise to the expectations we set for them.    A lot of kids in Flint already got some crosses they got to bear.  They've already got people telling them, oh, it's too tough for you because you're black or you're poor.  They will do fine as long as we do right by them.  And that's my intention.  And set high expectations for them.

Just a couple more points.  What happened here is just an extreme example, an extreme and tragic case of what's happening in a lot of places around the country.  We've seen unacceptably high levels of lead in townships along the Jersey Shore and in North Carolina's major cities.  We've seen it in the capitals of South Carolina and Mississippi.  And even, not long ago, lead-contaminated drinking water was found right down the street from the United States Capitol.

So Flint is just a tip of the iceberg in terms of us reinvesting in our communities.    We've seen bridges fall and levies break.  So we've got to break that mindset.  These things aren't a coincidence.  They're the same mindset that left Flint's water unsafe to drink.  And it's self-destructive when we don't invest in our communities.  Because a lot of times the people who are against government spending, they'll say, well, the private sector is the key.  The private sector is the key for our economy.  Free markets and free enterprise are great.  But companies won't invest in a place where your infrastructure is crumbling and your roads are broke.    You're not going to start a business or be able to recruit outstanding staff if there's no safe drinking water in the city.

So my hope is, is that this begins a national conversation about what we need to do to invest in future generations.  And it's no secret that, on this pipeline of neglect, a lot of times it's the most poor folks who are left behind.  It's working people who are left behind.  We see it in communities across the Midwest that haven't recovered since the plants shut down.  We see it on inner city corners where they might be able to drink the water, but they can't find a job.  We see it in the rural hills of Appalachia.

We've got to break that mindset that says that that neighborhood over there, that's not my problem; those kids over there, they don't look like my kids exactly, so I don't have to worry about them -- out of sight, out of mind.  We've got to break that attitude that says somehow there's an ""us"" in ""them,"" and remind ourselves that there's just one big ""we"" -- the American family, and everybody has got to look out for each other.    Because the kids here in Flint aren't ""those"" kids, they're ""our"" kids.    That's what Scripture teaches us.  But I'm not going to start preaching in front of some pastors.

So let me just close by saying this.  Look, I know this has been a scary time.  I know this is disappointing.  You've been let down.  But there is a sermon about a phoenix rising from these ashes.  And there is the opportunity out of this complete screw-up, this painful tragedy, this neglect, this disappointment to actually pull together and make for a better future.

Sometimes it takes a crisis for everybody to focus their attention.  Because there have been a lot of crises going on in Flint; they just weren't as loud and noisy, and nobody noticed.    There are a lot of small, quiet crises going on in the lives of people around this country.  And this helps lift it up.

And when we see it, and we understand it, and we feel it, then maybe we start making a connection with each other.  And that begins to change our mindset and improve our politics and improve our government to make it more responsive and more accountable.  And the good news is, is that that's the natural mindset of our young people.  That's why I'm so hopeful about the people of Flint.  That's why I'm so hopeful about America generally, is I meet young people all the time, and they've got a mindset just like Little Miss Flint here.  She decides, I'm just going right to the President, because I think we can fix this.  Or the mindset of Isiah raising $15,000 to help an elementary school where he's never been.

That's America.  That's who we are at our best.  We are a nation of individuals, and we should be proud of everything that we can accomplish on our own through hard work, and grit, and looking after our own families, and making sure we're raising our children right.  But we don't do these things alone.  Ultimately, our success is dependent on each other.  Our success is dependent on each other.

I have had the privilege of being the President of the United States, a big office -- an office that gives me enormous power and enormous responsibility.  But the thing I've learned in that job is that I can't do it by myself.  I can't fix every problem on my own.  I need a mother-in-law who helps Michelle and me raise Malia and Sasha.  I need incredible staff who are carrying out our policies to sign people up for health care.  I've got to have our incredible men and women in uniform who are willing to go overseas and fight on behalf of our freedom.    I've got to have governors and mayors who are willing to work with me to get things done in their states and in their cities.

And, most of all, I need fellow citizens who share the values that built this great country and are willing to work with me and work together to make it better.  I said this before:  The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen.  It's more important than the President.  More important than any senator or governor or mayor.    It is the idea that each of us has something to contribute, each of us has something to give back.

So, Flint, I'm here not just to say I've got your back.  I'm here not just to say that you will get help.  I'm also here to say you've got power.  I'm also here to say you count.  I'm also here to say that you can make a difference and rebuild this city better than ever.  And you'll have a friend and partner in the President of the United States.

God bless you.  God bless Flint.  God bless Michigan.  God bless the United States of America.
","The Flint, Michigan, water crisis began in April 2014. This week, two years later, President Obama stood before a crowd of Flint residents and said: ""I've come here to tell you that I've got your back, that we're paying attention.""

And people wonder why Bernie Sanders is doing so well.

This being Barack Obama, he went on, embellishing his commitment to the people of Flint: ""I will not rest, and I'm going to make sure that the leaders at every level of government don't rest until every drop of water that flows to your home is safe to drink and safe to cook with and safe to bathe in, because that's part of the basic responsibilities of a government in the United States of America.""

It's worth parsing that last sentence about clean water being a basic responsibility ""of a government in the United States of America.""

A government? Which government? Flint's, or Michigan's, or Barack Obama's government in Washington?

After two years, what we know about this water crisis is that governments indeed failed at the local, state and federal level. That may have something to do with why the presidential campaign is overflowing, from right to left, with the idea that government is ""failing"" in virtually every imaginable respect. So maybe Mr. Obama has touched on something important, to wit: Why is it that government, whether in Flint or Washington, is in a failed state?

It looks to us as if Mr. Obama sensed that the narrative of the Flint failure was turning against his view of government, so he decided it was necessary to reframe the problem. He told the Flint residents that their crisis was the result of ""a larger issue,"" which was a certain mindset toward government. ""It's a mindset,"" Mr. Obama said, ""that believes that less government is the highest good no matter what.""

No matter what? No one believes that. The anger coursing through the electorate now is over a government that doesn't seem to be able to do its job -- no matter what.

The Flint water crisis is a case study in government that has become a morass of conflicting regulations and authorities, which in turn ensures that instead of responsibility or accountability -- at any level -- the agents of government spend their time buck-passing.

At congressional hearings in March, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy bucked it over to the state of Michigan, which had given her people ""confusing, incomplete and incorrect information."" And so EPA staff was ""unable to understand the problem"" until it was too late.

But the EPA Region 5 administrator who later resigned, Susan Hedman, told Congress at that hearing she didn't intervene in September 2015 for fear the Michigan Attorney General might sue her agency.

Worth noting here is the Clean Water Rule that Mr. Obama waved into existence in May, and with which the EPA now claims federal dominion over ditches and prairie potholes. But for Flint's purposes, the more relevant directive is the 1991 federal Lead and Copper Rule, which gave EPA authority to control lead and copper in drinking water. Scientists have been urging a clarifying revision of that rule for the last decade. The update isn't expected until sometime in 2017.

As to Ms. Hedman's fear of being sued by Michigan, maybe she had a point. Another recent Obama directive, the Clean Power Plan, is creating tension with the states and has made state officials defensive about their turf.

In Mr. Obama's telling, Flints happen because of a ""corrosive attitude"" that forces us to ""underinvest"" in pipes, bridges and roads. That is, any government failure is due to a lack of funding. And the opposite: Spend more and government failure goes away.

A counter-view would be that ""we"" underinvest in better infrastructure because entitlement spending has first claim on so much of the revenue taxpayers send government, at every level. In Flint, pensions and retiree health benefits consumed one-third of the city's budget.

The default solution, for Mr. Obama, is that Washington's rainbow pot can be expanded to pay for Flints everywhere. This is what he means by, ""I've got your back."" The prudent might slip a hand around to their back pocket.
","President Obama vowed federal support for the beleaguered residents of this city on Wednesday and said government officials at all levels should have prevented Flint's water supply from being contaminated with lead.

In his first visit to the city since the water crisis began, Mr. Obama received updates from local officials and residents, made a show of drinking filtered tap water, and told a crowd of about 1,000 people at a high school that they deserved more from their leaders.

""I've come here to tell you that I've got your back, that we're paying attention,"" Mr. Obama told the crowd, which cheered loudly.

""I will not rest,"" he vowed, ""and I'm going to make sure that the leaders at every level of government don't rest until every drop of water that flows to your home is safe to drink and safe to cook with and safe to bathe in, because that's part of the basic responsibilities of a government in the United States of America.""

Mr. Obama, who coughed occasionally throughout the speech, paused at one point and looked offstage. ""Can I get a glass of water?"" he asked, drawing laughs and applause.

""I really did need a glass of water,"" Mr. Obama said as he sipped the water that an aide handed to him. ""This is not a stunt.""

Many here welcomed the president's message, but his visit, months after the magnitude of the water crisis became apparent, also prompted expressions of exasperation from residents who are still struggling to confront the health and safety repercussions of drinking lead-tainted water for months.

When he landed in Flint on Wednesday, the president was greeted with evident good will from people here, many of whom voted for him twice and consider themselves supporters.

But mixed with the affection were misgivings. Many Flint residents say that the federal Environmental Protection Agency shares the blame for failing to forcefully intervene early in the crisis, even after receiving complaints in 2014 that the water was foul and discolored.

Dozens of neighbors and demonstrators gathered across the street from the high school where Mr. Obama was scheduled to appear. Some chanted in unison, ""Obama, Obama, can't you see, this Flint water is killing me."" Others waved bottles filled with brown water and wore T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan #FlintLivesMatter. Volunteers carried clipboards, busily soliciting signatures as part of a statewide effort to recall Gov. Rick Snyder.

In the seventh month since officials acknowledged the crisis, with unfiltered water still unsafe to drink, many remain angry with Mr. Snyder for the state's failure to prevent the contamination. When Mr. Snyder tried to apologize to the crowd on Wednesday, he had to speak over repeated eruptions of boos and jeers.

""You didn't create this problem,"" he said. ""Government failed you.""

""You failed us,"" several people in the audience yelled.

But residents are also impatient that more federal aid has not made its way to Flint so that the lead pipes that contributed to the contamination can be replaced.

On Tuesday, Valerie Smith paused from taking orders at Spectacular Spudz at the Flint Farmers' Market to recall her thoughts when she heard about Mr. Obama's visit.

""I was like, 'Obama's coming?' "" she said, cracking a smile. "" 'That's great. Bring a check.' ""

The Department of Health and Human Services announced a $10 million grant on Wednesday for health services in Michigan, including $1 million for a health center in Flint that is treating those affected by the water. White House officials said the federal government had already provided nine million liters of water and 55,000 water filters.

""It's a little too late,"" Jimmie Stephen, a truck driver, said as he walked down Saginaw Street in downtown Flint on Tuesday. ""The E.P.A. had a job to do, and they ignored it. None of the politicians have helped us. I think the community is just going to have to band together to resolve our problems.""

Mr. Obama had been under pressure for months to visit Flint. White House aides said he had decided to make the trip after receiving a letter from an 8-year-old girl, Amariyanna Copeny, who is known among many in the city as Little Miss Flint.

After receiving a briefing from federal officials who have been on the ground in Flint for months, Mr. Obama urged residents to use filters for their drinking water and to make sure that children received medical checkups. At the end of the briefing, he took a sip from a glass of Flint water after saying, ""Filtered water is safe.""

Karen Weaver, the mayor of Flint, told the high school audience that Mr. Obama deserved credit for a robust response to the crisis. ""We asked for help, Mr. President, and you answered the call,"" she said.

But critics have said the federal government was conspicuously absent during the crucial months before the crisis was declared, when residents were drinking the lead-tainted water, and state and local officials were largely brushing off their concerns.

Emails from last summer, which were among thousands of pages of messages and documents released this year, show a lack of alarm about the crisis on the part of some E.P.A. officials. Susan Hedman, a regional administrator for the agency, resigned in January, and Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the E.P.A., withstood withering attacks by Republicans during a House Oversight Committee hearing about the agency's failure to step in. She had argued that states bore primary responsibility for water safety.

Officials at the E.P.A. pointed out Wednesday that a commission had concluded that state officials were primarily responsible and that investigations into the crisis had led to indictments of people at the state and local levels. Monica Lee, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the federal government had not been told the truth about the situation in Flint.

""We can't serve our oversight role when the state is lying to us about what they're doing,"" Ms. Lee said.

Mr. Obama also used his visit to Flint as an opportunity to pressure Republicans in Congress to support billions of dollars in improvements to infrastructure around the country. He tweaked them and some of the party's presidential candidates, who have suggested deep cuts to federal environmental programs.

The president chided Republicans for a ""corrosive attitude"" that does not support government investments in public infrastructure.

""It's a mind-set that says that environmental rules designed to keep your water clean or your air clean are optional or not that important,"" Mr. Obama said. ""That attitude is as corrosive to our democracy as the stuff that results in lead in your water. It leads to systemic neglect. It leads to carelessness and callousness.""

95,95,2016-06-13-OrlandoShooting.txt,"d Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder -- a horrific massacre -- of dozens of innocent people.  We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts.  We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city.  Although itâs still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate.  And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.

I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisors.  The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement.  Iâve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation. 

We are still learning all the facts.  This is an open investigation.  Weâve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer.  The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism.  And Iâve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what -- if any -- inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups.  What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred.  Over the coming days, weâll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us.

This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people.  This could have been any one of our communities.  So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need -- they are going to get it.  As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come.

We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harmâs way.  Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse.  Itâs the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough.

This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends -- our fellow Americans -- who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live.  The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub -- it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights. 

So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American -- regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation -- is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.  And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.

Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history.  The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle.  This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub.  And we have to decide if thatâs the kind of country we want to be.  And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.

In the coming hours and days, weâll learn about the victims of this tragedy.  Their names.  Their faces.  Who they were.  The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world.  Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families -- that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable.  And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change.  We need to demonstrate that we are defined more -- as a country -- by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us.

As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts -- friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives.  In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another.  We will not give in to fear or turn against each other.  Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.    

May God bless the Americans we lost this morning.  May He comfort their families.  May God continue to watch over this country that we love.  Thank you.
","The deadliest shooting attack in U.S. history killed at least 50 people at a popular gay nightclub here, injured 53, left a community and nation in grief and reignited concern about home-grown American terrorists.

Authorities said Omar S. Mateen opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in downtown Orlando in an onslaught that sent patrons scrambling for the exits. Many remained trapped inside in what became an hourslong siege. During the attack, Mr. Mateen took time to call 911 and claim allegiance to Islamic State, officials said, leading them to treat the shooting as a terror attack inspired by a foreign terror organization.

Police shot and killed Mr. Mateen at about 5 a.m. Sunday, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. He had carried an assault rifle and a handgun, Mr. Mina said.

""Today we're dealing with something that we never imagined and is unimaginable,"" Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said at a news briefing.

Many of the wounded were in critical condition at Orlando Regional Medical Center, where surgeries continued throughout the day, trauma surgeon Michael Cheatham said. Families waited for word of loved ones at an official outpost positioned near the hospital. Later in the day, authorities began releasing names of victims.

In a brief press conference Sunday, President Barack Obama called the shootings an ""act of terror and act of hate.""

Two counterterrorism officials said Mr. Mateen, 29 years old, worked as a security guard, had a gun license and was a U.S. citizen. Mr. Mateen was born in the U.S. to parents from Afghanistan. He lived in the Port Saint Lucie, Fla., area, officials said.

A woman who said she is the ex-wife of Mr. Mateen described him as an ""unbalanced"" person who was abusive during their marriage. Mr. Mateen had told her he wanted to become a police officer, she said on CNN, adding that she believed he was mentally unstable, but that she saw no sign that he had terrorist leanings.

A propaganda agency linked to Islamic State claimed the massacre was ""carried out by an Islamic State fighter"" and ""targeted a nightclub for homosexuals."" The statement from the propaganda outfit, known as Amaq, was distributed on Telegram, a secure communications channel.

Senior U.S. officials who reviewed the statement said it didn't contain any evidence of a link between the shooter and Islamic State, such as foreknowledge of the attack or indications that the group gave him direction.

In the territory it controls in Syria and Iraq, Islamic State routinely executes homosexuals and releases videos of its fighters throwing men accused of homosexuality off tall buildings. Islamic State supporters online called Sunday for more shootings in gay nightclubs world-wide and referred to an Islamic State spokesman's recent appeal for Western followers to launch attacks at home.

Mr. Mateen had twice been investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for terrorism links in recent years, but those cases were closed after interviews with him proved inconclusive, FBI officials said.

The nightclub shooting in downtown Orlando began around 2 a.m. Sunday.

""All the killing that was done was with an assault rifle, a single weapon . . . it was done very quickly also,"" said Rep. Alan Grayson, (D., Fla.). ""There's blood everywhere"" in the club, he said, noting that he spoke to someone who had seen the club after the shooting.

Mayor Dyer said police didn't negotiate with the shooter during the roughly three-hour standoff that followed, though he said officials did communicate with him. Through text messages with hostages, law enforcement officers learned that between five and eight hostages were in a room inside the nightclub with the shooter, while 15 to 25 others were in an isolated room elsewhere in the club.

Police breached the wall of the isolated room with an armored vehicle called a BearCat and were able to move the hostages to safety around 5 a.m.

The shooter then opened the club's door and started firing outside, Mr. Dyer said. ""That's when we took him down,"" he said.

Police didn't immediately enter the club after the shooter was killed because of concerns about possible explosive devices, Mr. Dyer said. Once inside they learned that instead of the feared 20 dead, there were 39 fatalities plus the shooter, along with two outside the club, he said. Nine other people died at or en route to hospitals, he said.

Chief Mina said authorities found a handgun and ""an AR-15-type assault rifle,"" along with an unknown number of ammunition rounds.

Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found that Mr. Mateen had legally purchased a rifle and a hand gun within the last week or so, said Trevor Velinor, assistant special agent in charge for the agency's Tampa field division. He declined to say where the weapons were purchased.

A Florida state database shows Mr. Mateen had two firearms licenses: a security officer license and a statewide firearms license. Both are listed as scheduled to expire in September 2017.

The high death toll in Orlando underscores the challenges presented by nightclubs or the Bataclan concert theater in Paris, scene of a terror attack last November that killed 90 people, said Ed Davis, a former Boston police commissioner who is a private security consultant.

Clubs present a dense crowd of people, loud music that can be confused with gunfire and drinking that can slow reaction time, Mr. Davis said. ""There's the whole issue of disbelief, thinking it could be part of a show,"" he said.

Meantime, police in Santa Monica, Calif., arrested a man who was armed with weapons and explosive material and said he was in town for a gay pride parade Sunday in nearby West Hollywood, law-enforcement officials said. They added that there was no known connection to the Orlando shootings. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that while there were no credible threats, New Yorkers would see additional police presence in busy areas and ""in front of some key LGBT institutions.""

On Sunday, officials gathered evidence at the nightclub with medical examiner's staff in white, hooded body suits and blue protective booties.

Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs said Orlando's close-knit lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has been ""dramatically impacted."" The community is united, she said, adding that ""what we saw last night does not reflect what we feel in our hearts and our souls here in Orange County.""

The incident follows the fatal shooting late Friday of 22-year-old singer Christina Grimmie after her concert in Orlando by a 27-year-old Florida man who later killed himself. Ms. Grimmie was a YouTube sensation and former contestant on ""The Voice.""

It also follows a December shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., during which Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday party of his co-workers, killing 14 people and injuring 22. The couple was killed during a shootout with police.

Federal authorities have said Farook spent years becoming more radicalized and violence-oriented, in part by watching videos that advocated jihad. On the day of the attack, a Facebook account used by his wife posted a pledge of allegiance to Islamic State.
","A man who called 911 to proclaim allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group, and who had been investigated in the past for possible terrorist ties, stormed a gay nightclub here Sunday morning, wielding an assault rifle and a pistol, and carried out the worst mass shooting in United States history, leaving 50 people dead and 53 wounded.

The attacker, identified by law enforcement officials as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old who was born in New York, turned what had been a celebratory night of dancing to salsa and merengue music at the crowded Pulse nightclub into a panicked scene of unimaginable slaughter, the floors slicked with blood, the dead and the injured piled atop one another. Terrified people poured onto the darkened streets of the surrounding neighborhood, some carried wounded victims to safety, and police vehicles were pressed into service as makeshift ambulances to rush people to hospitals.

Joel Figueroa and his friends ""were dancing by the hip-hop area when I heard shots, bam, bam, bam,"" he said, adding, ""Everybody was screaming and running toward the front door.""

Pulse, which calls itself ""Orlando's Latin Hotspot,"" was holding its weekly ""Upscale Latin Saturdays"" party. The shooting began around 2 a.m., and some patrons thought at first that the booming reports they heard were firecrackers or part of the loud, thumping dance music.

Some people who were trapped inside hid where they could, calling 911 or posting messages to social media, pleading for help. The club posted a stark message on its Facebook page: ""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.""

Hundreds of people gathered in the glare of flashing red lights on the fringes of the law enforcement cordon around the nightclub, and later at area hospitals, hoping desperately for some word on the fates of their relatives and friends.

More than 12 hours after the attack, anguished relatives paced between Orlando Regional Medical Center and a nearby hotel as they waited for word. They were told that so many were gunned down that victims would be tagged as anonymous until the hospital was able to identify them.

""We are here suffering, knowing nothing,"" said Baron Serrano, whose brother, Juan Rivera, 36, had been celebrating a friend's birthday with his husband and was now unaccounted for. ""I cannot understand why they can't tell me anything because my brother is a very well-known person here in Orlando. He is a hairstylist, and everybody knows him.""

A tally of victims whose relatives had been notified began slowly building on a city website; by 6 p.m., it had six names. Among them was Juan Ramon Guerrero, a 22-year-old man of Dominican descent who had gone to the club with his boyfriend, Christopher Leinonen, who goes by the name Drew, because they wanted to listen to salsa. A friend, Brandon Wolf, watched people carry Mr. Guerrero outside, his body riddled with gunshot wounds.

But no one knew what had become of Mr. Leinonen. His mother, Christine, anxious because of health problems, had woken at 3 a.m. to news of the shooting, and learned from Mr. Wolf that her son had been inside.

A three-hour standoff followed the initial assault, with people inside effectively held hostage until around 5 a.m., when law enforcement officials led by a SWAT team raided the club, using an armored vehicle and explosives designed to disorient and distract. Over a dozen police officers and sheriff's deputies engaged in a shootout with Mr. Mateen, leaving him dead and an officer wounded, his life saved by a Kevlar helmet that deflected a bullet.

At least 30 people inside were rescued, and even the hardened police veterans who took the building and combed through it, aiding the living and identifying the dead, were shaken by what they saw, said John Mina, the Orlando police chief. ""Just to look into the eyes of our officers told the whole story,"" he said.

It was the worst act of terrorism on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001, and the deadliest attack on a gay target in the nation's history, though officials said it was not clear whether some victims had been accidentally shot by law enforcement officers.

The toll of 50 dead is larger than the number of murders in Orlando over the previous three years. Of an estimated 320 people in the club, nearly one-third were shot. The casualties far exceeded those in the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech, where 32 people were killed, and the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., where 26 people died.

""In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,"" President Obama said in a special address from the White House. ""We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united as Americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.""

As he had done after several previous mass shootings, the president said the shooting demonstrated the need for what he called ""common-sense"" gun measures.

""This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or a house of worship or a movie theater or a nightclub,"" Mr. Obama said. ""We have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well.""

The shooting quickly made its way into the presidential campaign. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who has accused Mr. Obama of weakness on radical Islam and has called for barring Muslim immigrants, suggested on Twitter that the president should resign.

""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism,"" he wrote. ""I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!""

Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, released a statement saying: ""We need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home.""

Fears of violence led to heightened security at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender events and gathering places around the country. Law enforcement officials in Santa Monica, Calif., confirmed the arrest on Sunday of a heavily armed man who said he was in the area for West Hollywood's gay pride parade. The authorities, however, said they did not know of any connection between the California arrest and the Orlando shooting.

The F.B.I. investigated Mr. Mateen in 2013 when he made comments to co-workers suggesting he had terrorist ties, and again the next year, for possible connections to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American who became a suicide bomber in Syria, said Ronald Hopper, an assistant agent in charge of the bureau's Tampa Division. But each time, the F.B.I. found no solid evidence that Mr. Mateen had any real connection to terrorism or had broken any laws. Still, he is believed to be on at least one watch list.

Mr. Mateen, who lived in Fort Pierce, Fla., was able to continue working as a security guard with the security firm G4S, where he had worked since 2007, and he was able to buy guns. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Mr. Mateen had legally bought a long gun and a pistol in the past week or two, though it was not clear whether those were the weapons used in the assault, which officials described as a handgun and an AR-15 type of assault rifle.

A former co-worker, Daniel Gilroy, said Mr. Mateen had talked often about killing people and had voiced hatred of gays, blacks, women and Jews.

Around the time of the massacre, Mr. Mateen called 911 and declared his allegiance to the Islamic State, the brutal group that has taken over parts of Syria, Iraq and Libya, Agent Hopper said. Other law enforcement officials said he called after beginning his assault.

Hours later, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed responsibility in a statement released over an encrypted phone app used by the group. It stated that the attack ""was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,"" according to a transcript provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist propaganda.

But officials cautioned that even if Mr. Mateen, who court records show was briefly married and then divorced, was inspired by the group, there was no indication that it had trained or instructed him, or had any direct connection with him. Some other terrorist attackers have been ""self-radicalized,"" including the pair who killed 14 people in December in San Bernardino, Calif., who also proclaimed allegiance to the Islamic State, but apparently had no contact with the group.

The Islamic State has encouraged ""lone wolf"" attacks in the West, a point reinforced recently by a group spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, in his annual speech just before the holy month of Ramadan. In past years, the Islamic State and Al Qaeda ramped up attacks during Ramadan.

American Muslim groups condemned the shooting. ""The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,"" said Rasha Mubarak, the Orlando regional coordinator of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

96,96,2016-07-28-DemocraticConvention.txt," Hello, America!

Hello, Democrats!

So, twelve years ago tonight, I addressed this convention for the very first time.

You met my two little girls, Malia and Sasha -- now two amazing young women who just fill me with pride.  You fell for my brilliant wife and partner Michelle, who has made me a better father and a better man; whoâs gone on to inspire our nation as First Lady; and who somehow hasnât aged a day.

I -- I know the same canât be said for me.  My girls remind me all the time: ""Wow, youâve changed so much, daddy."" And then they try to clean it up. Yeah. Not bad -- just more mature.

And -- And itâs true: I -- I was so young that first time in Boston. And...look, I'll admit maybe a little nervous addressing such a big crowd.  But I was filled with faith, faith in America -- the generous, bighearted, hopeful country that made my story, that made all of our stories possible.

A lotâs happened over the years.  And while this nation has been tested by war, and it's been tested recession and all manner of challenges, I stand before you again tonight, after almost two terms as your President, to tell you I am more optimistic about the future of America than every before.

How could I not be after all that weâve achieved together?

After the worst recession in 80 years, weâve fought our way back.  Weâve seen deficits come down, 401k)s recover, an auto industry set new records, unemployment reach eight-year lows, and our businesses create 15 million new jobs.

After a century of trying, we declared that health care in America is not a privilege for a few; it is a right for everybody.

After decades of talk, we finally began to wean ourselves off foreign oil. We doubled our production of clean energy.

We brought more of our troops home to their families. And we delivered justice to Osama bin Laden.

Through diplomacy, we shut down Iranâs nuclear weapons program.

We opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba; brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our children.

We put policies in place to help students with loans, protect consumers from fraud, cut veteran homelessness almost in half.

And through countless acts of quiet courage, America learned that love has no limits, and marriage equality is now a reality across the land.

By so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started. And through every victory and every setback, Iâve insisted that change is never easy, and never quick; that we wouldnât meet all of our challenges in one term, or one presidency, or even in one lifetime.

So tonight, Iâm here to tell you that, yes, we've still got more work to do -- more work to do for every American still in need of a good job or a raise, paid leave or a decent retirement; for every child who needs a sturdier ladder out of poverty or a world-class education; for everyone who has not yet felt the progress of these past seven and a half years.  We need to keep making our streets safer, and our criminal justice system fairer; our homeland more secure; our world more peaceful and sustainable for the next generation.  Weâre not done perfecting our union, or living up to our founding creed -- that all of us are created equal; all of use are free in the eyes of God.

And that work involves a big choice this November.  I think it's fair to say, this is not your typical election.  Itâs not just a choice between parties or policies -- the usual debates between left and right.  This is a more fundamental choice -- about who we are as a people, and whether we stay true to this great American experiment in self-government.

Look, we Democrats have always had plenty of differences with the Republican Party, and thereâs nothing wrong with that; itâs precisely this contest of idea[s] that pushes our country forward.

But what we heard in Cleveland last week wasnât particularly Republican -- and it sure wasnât conservative. What we heard was a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other, and turn away from the rest of the world. There were no serious solutions to pressing problems -- just the fanning of resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate. And that is not the America I know.

The America I know is full of courage and optimism and ingenuity. The America I know is decent and generous. Sure, we have real anxieties about paying the bills, and protecting our kids, caring for a sick parent. We get frustrated with political gridlock, and worry about racial divisions. We are shocked and saddened by the madness of Orlando -- or Nice. There are pockets of America that never recovered from factory closures -- men who took pride in hard work and providing for their families who now feel forgotten; parents who wonder whether their kids will have the same opportunities that we had.

All of that is real.  We are challenged to do better; to be better.

But as Iâve traveled this country, through all 50 states, as Iâve rejoiced with you and mourned with you, what I have also seen, more than anything, is what is right with America.   I see people working hard and starting businesses.  I see people teaching kids and serving our country.  I see engineers inventing stuff, doctors coming up with new cures.  I see a younger generation full of energy and new ideas, not constrained by what is, ready to seize what ought to be.

And most of all, I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together -- black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big, bold country that we love.   That's what I see.  That's the America I know!

And there is only one candidate in this race who believes in that future, has devoted her life to that future; a mother and a grandmother who would do anything to help our children thrive; a leader with real plans to break down barriers, and blast through glass ceilings, and widen the circle of opportunity to every single American -- the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.

Let me tell you, eight years ago, you may remember Hillary and I were rivals for the Democratic nomination.  We battled for a year and a half.  Let me tell you, it was tough, because Hillary was tough.  I was worn out. She was doing everything I was doing, but just like Ginger Rogers, it was backwards in heels. And every time I thought I might have the race won, Hillary just came back stronger.

But after it was all over, I asked Hillary to join my team.  And she was a little surprised.  Some of my staff was surprised.  But ultimately she said yes -- because she knew that what was at stake was bigger than either of us.   And for four years -- for four years, I had a front-row seat to her intelligence, her judgment, and her discipline.  I came to realize that her unbelievable work ethic wasnât for praise, it wasnât for attention -- that she was in this for everyone who needs a champion.  I understood that after all these years, she has never forgotten just who sheâs fighting for.

Hillary has still got the tenacity that she had as a young woman, working at the Childrenâs Defense Fund, going door-to-door to ultimately make sure kids with disabilities could get a quality education.

Sheâs still got the heart she showed as our First Lady, working with Congress to help push through a Childrenâs Health Insurance Program that to this day protects millions of kids.

Sheâs still seared with the memory of every American she met who lost loved ones on 9/11 -- which is why, as a Senator from New York, she fought so hard for funding to help first responders, to help the city rebuild; why, as Secretary of State, she sat with me in the Situation Room and forcefully argued in favor of the mission that took out bin Laden.

You know, nothing truly prepares you for the demands of the Oval Office.  You can read about it.  You can study it.  But until youâve sat at that desk, you donât know what itâs like to manage a global crisis, or send young people to war.  But Hillary has been in the room; sheâs been part of those decisions.  She knows whatâs at stake in the decisions our government makes -- whatâs at stake for the working family, for the senior citizen, or the small business owner, for the soldier, for the veteran.  And even in the midst of crisis, she listens to people, and she keeps her cool, and she treats everybody with respect.  And no matter how daunting the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never, ever quits.

That is the Hillary I know.  Thatâs the Hillary Iâve come to admire.  And thatâs why I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman -- not me, not Bill, nobody -- more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as President of the United States of America.

I hope you don't mind, Bill, but I was just telling the truth, man.

And, by the way, in case youâre wondering about her judgment, take a look at her choice of running mate.  Tim Kaine is as good a man, as humble and as committed a public servant as anybody that I know.  I know his family.  I love Anne. I love their kids.  He will be a great Vice President.  He will make Hillary a better President -- just like my dear friend and brother, Joe Biden, has made me a better President.

Now, Hillary has real plans to address the concerns sheâs heard from you on the campaign trail.  Sheâs got specific ideas to invest in new jobs, to help workers share in their companyâs profits, to help put kids in preschool and put students through college without taking on a ton of debt.  Thatâs what leaders do.

And then thereâs Donald Trump.

You know, the Donald is not really a plans guy.  Heâs not really a facts guy, either.  He calls himself a business guy, which is true, but I have to say, I know plenty of businessmen and women whoâve achieved remarkable success without leaving a trail of lawsuits, and unpaid workers, and people feeling like they got cheated.

Does anyone really believe that a guy whoâs spent his 70 years on this Earth showing no regard for working people is suddenly going to be your champion?  Your voice?

If so, you should vote for him.  But if youâre someone whoâs truly concerned about paying your bills, if you're really concerned about pocketbook issues and seeing the economy grow, and creating more opportunity for everybody, then the choice isnât even close.   If you want someone with a lifelong track record of fighting for higher wages, and better benefits, and a fairer tax code, and a bigger voice for workers, and stronger regulations on Wall Street, then you should vote for Hillary Clinton.

If youâre rightly concerned about whoâs going to keep you and your family safe in a dangerous world, well, the choice is even clearer.  Hillary Clinton is respected around the world -- not just by leaders, but by the people they serve.

I have to say this.  People outside of the United States do not understand whatâs going on in this election.  They really don't.  Because they know Hillary.  Theyâve seen her work.  Sheâs worked closely with our intelligence teams, our diplomats, our military.  She has the judgment and the experience and the temperament to meet the threat from terrorism.  Itâs not new to her.  Our troops have pounded ISIL without mercy, taking out their leaders, taking back territory.   And I know Hillary wonât relent until ISIL is destroyed.  She will finish the job.   And she will do it without resorting to torture, or banning entire religions from entering our country.  She is fit and she is ready to be the next Commander-in-Chief.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump calls our military a disaster.  Apparently, he doesnât know the men and women who make up the strongest fighting force the world has ever known.   He suggests America is weak.  He must not hear the billions of men and women and children, from the Baltics to Burma, who still look to America to be the light of freedom and dignity and human rights.   He cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein, tells our NATO allies that stood by our side after 9/11 that they have to pay up if they want our protection.

Well, Americaâs promises do not come with a price tag.  We meet our commitments.  We bear our burdens.   Thatâs one of the reasons why almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office.

America is already great.   America is already strong.   And I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.   In fact, it doesnât depend on any one person.  And that, in the end, may be the biggest difference in this election -- the meaning of our democracy.

Ronald Reagan called America âa shining city on a hill.â  Donald Trump calls it âa divided crime sceneâ that only he can fix.  It doesnât matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as theyâve been in decades -- because heâs not actually offering any real solutions to those issues.  Heâs just offering slogans, and heâs offering fear.  Heâs betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election.

And that's another bet that Donald Trump will lose.   And the reason he'll lose it is because heâs selling the American people short.  We're not a fragile people.  We're not a frightful people.  Our power doesnât come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way.  We donât look to be ruled.  Our power comes from those immortal declarations first put to paper right here in Philadelphia all those years ago:  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that We the People, can form a more perfect union.

That's who we are.  Thatâs our birthright -- the capacity to shape our own destiny.   Thatâs what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny and our GIs to liberate a continent.  Itâs what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot, and marchers to cross a bridge in Selma, and workers to organize and fight for collective bargaining and better wages.

America has never been about what one person says heâll do for us.  Itâs about what can be achieved by us, together through the hard and slow, and sometimes frustrating, but ultimately enduring work of self-government.

And thatâs what Hillary Clinton understands.  She knows that this is a big, diverse country.  She has seen it.  She's traveled.  She's talked to folks.  And she understands that most issues are rarely black and white.  She understands that even when youâre 100 percent right, getting things done requires compromise; that democracy doesnât work if we constantly demonize each other.   She knows that for progress to happen, we have to listen to each other, and see ourselves in each other, and fight for our principles but also fight to find common ground, no matter how elusive that may sometimes seem.

Hillary knows we can work through racial divides in this country when we realize the worry black parents feel when their son leaves the house isnât so different than what a brave copâs family feels when he puts on the blue and goes to work; that we can honor police and treat every community fairly.   We can do that.  And she knows -- she knows that acknowledging problems that have festered for decades isnât making race relations worse -- itâs creating the possibility for people of goodwill to join and make things better.

Hillary knows we can insist on a lawful and orderly immigration system while still seeing striving students and their toiling parents as loving families, not criminals or rapists; families that came here for the same reason our forebears came -- to work and to study, and to make a better life, in a place where we can talk and worship and love as we please.  She knows their dream is quintessentially American, and the American Dream is something no wall will ever contain.   These are the things that Hillary knows.

It can be frustrating, this business of democracy.  Trust me, I know.  Hillary knows, too.  When the other side refuses to compromise, progress can stall.  People are hurt by the inaction. Supporters can grow impatient and worry that youâre not trying hard enough; that youâve maybe sold out.  But I promise you, when we keep at it, when we change enough minds, when we deliver enough votes, then progress does happen.  And if you doubt that, just ask the 20 million more people who have health care today.   Just ask the Marine who proudly serves his country without hiding the husband that he loves.

Democracy works, America, but we got to want it -- not just during an election year, but all the days in between.

So if you agree that thereâs too much inequality in our economy and too much money in our politics, we all need to be as vocal and as organized and as persistent as Bernie Sanders supporters have been during this election.   We all need to get out and vote for Democrats up and down the ticket, and then hold them accountable until they get the job done.

That's right -- feel the Bern!

If you want more justice in the justice system, then weâve all got to vote -- not just for a President, but for mayors, and sheriffs, and stateâs attorneys, and state legislators.  That's where the criminal law is made.   And weâve got to work with police and protesters until laws and practices are changed.  That's how democracy works.

If you want to fight climate change, weâve got to engage not only young people on college campuses, we've got to reach out to the coal miner whoâs worried about taking care of his family, the single mom worried about gas prices.

If you want to protect our kids and our cops from gun violence, weâve got to get the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, who agree on things like background checks to be just as vocal and just as determined as the gun lobby that blocks change through every funeral that we hold.  That is how change happens.

Look, Hillary has got her share of critics.  She has been caricatured by the right and by some on the left.  She has been accused of everything you can imagine -- and some things that you cannot.  But she knows thatâs what happens when youâre under a microscope for 40 years.  She knows that sometimes during those 40 years sheâs made mistakes -- just like I have; just like we all do.   Thatâs what happens when we try.  Thatâs what happens when youâre the kind of citizen Teddy Roosevelt once described -- not the timid souls who criticize from the sidelines, but someone âwho is actually in the arenaâ¦who strives valiantly; who errsâ¦but who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement.â

Hillary Clinton is that woman in the arena.   Sheâs been there for us -- even if we havenât always noticed.  And if youâre serious about our democracy, you canât afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue.  Youâve got to get in the arena with her, because democracy isnât a spectator sport.   America isnât about âyes, he will.â  Itâs about âyes, we can.â   And weâre going to carry Hillary to victory this fall, because thatâs what the moment demands.

Yes, we can.  Not ""yes, she can.""  Not ""yes, I can.""  ""Yes, we can.""

You know, thereâs been a lot of talk in this campaign about what America has lost -- people who tell us that our way of life is being undermined by pernicious changes and dark forces beyond our control.  They tell voters thereâs a âreal Americaâ out there that must be restored.  This isnât an idea, by the way, that started with Donald Trump.  Itâs been peddled by politicians for a long time -- probably from the start of our Republic.

And itâs got me thinking about the story I told you 12 years ago tonight, about my Kansas grandparents and the things they taught me when I was growing up.   See, my grandparents, they came from the heartland.  Their ancestors began settling there about 200 years ago.  I donât know if they have their birth certificates -- but they were there.   They were Scotch-Irish mostly -- farmers, teachers, ranch hands, pharmacists, oil rig workers.  Hardy, small town folks.  Some were Democrats, but a lot of them -- maybe even most of them -- were Republicans.  Party of Lincoln.

And my grandparents explained that folks in these parts, they didnât like show-offs.  They didnât admire braggarts or bullies.  They didnât respect mean-spiritedness, or folks who were always looking for shortcuts in life.  Instead, what they valued were traits like honesty and hard work, kindness, courtesy, humility, responsibility, helping each other out. Thatâs what they believed in.  True things.  Things that last.  The things we try to teach our kids.

And what my grandparents understood was that these values werenât limited to Kansas.  They werenât limited to small towns. These values could travel to Hawaii.   They could travel even to the other side of the world, where my mother would end up working to help poor women get a better life; trying to apply those values.  My grandparents knew these values werenât reserved for one race.  They could be passed down to a half-Kenyan grandson, or a half-Asian granddaughter.  In fact, they were the same values Michelleâs parents, the descendants of slaves, taught their own kids, living in a bungalow on the South Side of Chicago.   They knew these values were exactly what drew immigrants here, and they believed that the children of those immigrants were just as American as their own, whether they wore a cowboy hat or a yarmulke, a baseball cap or a hijab.

America has changed over the years.  But these values that my grandparents taught me -- they havenât gone anywhere.  Theyâre as strong as ever, still cherished by people of every party, every race, every faith.  They live on in each of us.  What makes us American, what makes us patriots is whatâs in here.  Thatâs what matters.

And thatâs why we can take the food and music and holidays and styles of other countries, and blend it into something uniquely our own.  Thatâs why we can attract strivers and entrepreneurs from around the globe to build new factories and create new industries here.  Thatâs why our military can look the way it does -- every shade of humanity, forged into common service.   Thatâs why anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end.

That is America.  That is America.  Those bonds of affection; that common creed.  We donât fear the future; we shape it.  We embrace it, as one people, stronger together than we are on our own.  Thatâs what Hillary Clinton understands -- this fighter, this stateswoman, this mother and grandmother, this public servant, this patriot -- thatâs the America sheâs fighting for.

And that is why I have confidence, as I leave this stage tonight, that the Democratic Party is in good hands.  My time in this office, it hasnât fixed everything.  As much as weâve done, thereâs still so much I want to do.  But for all the tough lessons Iâve had to learn, for all the places where Iâve fallen short -- Iâve told Hillary, and Iâll tell you, whatâs picked me back up every single time:  Itâs been you.  The American people.

Itâs the letter I keep on my wall from a survivor in Ohio who twice almost lost everything to cancer, but urged me to keep fighting for health care reform, even when the battle seemed lost.  Do not quit.

Itâs the painting I keep in my private office, a big-eyed, green owl with blue wings, made by a seven year-old girl who was taken from us in Newtown, given to me by her parents so I wouldnât forget -- a reminder of all the parents who have turned their grief into action.

Itâs the small business owner in Colorado who cut most of his own salary so he wouldnât have to lay off any of his workers in the recession -- because, he said, âthat wouldnât have been in the spirit of America.â

Itâs the conservative in Texas who said he disagreed with me on everything, but he appreciated that, like him, I try to be a good dad.

Itâs the courage of the young soldier from Arizona who nearly died on the battlefield in Afghanistan, but who has learned to speak again and walk again -- and earlier this year, stepped through the door of the Oval Office on his own power, to salute and shake my hand.

It is every American who believed we could change this country for the better, so many of you whoâd never been involved in politics, who picked up phones and hit the streets, and used the Internet in amazing new ways that I didnât really understand, but made change happen.  You are the best organizers on the planet, and I am so proud of all the change that you made possible.

Time and again, youâve picked me up.  And I hope, sometimes, I picked you up, too.   And tonight, I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me.   I ask you to carry her the same way you carried me.  Because you're who I was talking about 12 years ago when I talked about hope.  Itâs been you who fueled my dogged faith in our future, even when the odds were great; even when the road is long.  Hope in the face of difficulty.  Hope in the face of uncertainty.  The audacity of hope.

America, you've vindicated that hope these past eight years. And now Iâm ready to pass the baton and do my part as a private citizen.  So this year, in this election, Iâm asking you to join me -- to reject cynicism and reject fear, and to summon what is best in us; to elect Hillary Clinton as the next President of the United States, and show the world we still believe in the promise of this great nation.

Thank you for this incredible journey.  Letâs keep it going.

God bless you.

God bless the United States of America.
","President Barack Obama, with the end of his own presidency in sight, vouched for Hillary Clinton in a speech Wednesday intended to rebut Republican criticism of her record as secretary of state and elevate her as a tested leader at a time when national security is taking a central role in the presidential campaign.

""Nothing truly prepares you for the demands of the Oval Office,"" Mr. Obama said in the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. ""You don't know what it's like to manage a global crisis or send young people to war. But Hillary's been in the room. She's been part of those decisions.""

On the third day of the convention, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, Vice President Joe Biden and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined Mr. Obama in blasting Republican nominee Donald Trump, attacks sure to be echoed as they fan out on the campaign trail.

In an address that marked a symbolic transfer of Democratic political leadership, from the first African-American president to the first woman to become a major party's nominee, Mr. Obama also addressed Americans who are skeptical about Mrs. Clinton's trustworthiness.

""She's made mistakes, just like I have. Just like we all do,"" he said. ""That's what happens when we try.""

Mr. Trump opposes many of the policies Democrats put in place since 2009, including the health-care law, climate-change measures and the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Obama's aides have said one of the president's motivations for aggressively campaigning for Mrs. Clinton is his belief that Mr. Trump would undo those and other policies.

Throughout the night, Democrats painted a brutal portrait of Mr. Trump as a businessman who is out for himself, not others; who has no knowledge of world affairs or interest in learning; and who has a temperament too uneven to exercise leadership at home and abroad.

""America is already great,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And I promise you, our strength, our greatness does not depend on Donald Trump.""

In accepting the vice presidential nomination, Mr. Kaine, who peppered his speech with Spanish, made a case for Mrs. Clinton, but also railed against Mr. Trump.

""Folks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth,"" said Mr. Kaine. ""Our nation is too great to put it in the hands of a slick-talking, empty-promising, self-promoting, one-man wrecking crew.""

Mr. Biden said he has known Mrs. Clinton for more than three decades as an advocate for the middle class and derided Mr. Trump on that score: ""He cares about the middle class? Give me a break. That's a bunch of malarkey.""

He also said the Republican nominee is exploiting voter fears of terrorism. ""He has no clue about what makes America great,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Actually he has no clue, period.""

Mr. Bloomberg said Mrs. Clinton would be a ""problem solver, not a bomb thrower."" He said in his dealings with Mrs. Clinton ""we didn't always agree"" but she ""always listened and that's the kind of approach we need in Washington today.""

Mr. Obama's appearance came a day after delegates officially nominated Mrs. Clinton and largely set aside lingering tensions between her supporters and those of her primary rival Bernie Sanders. Senior administration officials said Mr. Obama called Mr. SandersTuesdaynight to thank him for helping facilitate the show of party unity.

The president sought to reinforce Mrs. Clinton's narrative that her command of national security issues makes her a more solid choice for voters than Mr. Trump. He described how he leaned on her during some of the most critical moments of his presidency, including when he weighed whether to authorize the mission that killed Osama bin Laden.

And he cast her as the only candidate who has fought for middle class Americans, drawing a stark contrast with the dim outlook of the country during the Republican convention last week.

""What we heard in Cleveland last week wasn't particularly Republican -- and it sure wasn't conservative,"" Mr. Obama said. ""What we heard was a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other, and turn away from the rest of the world. There were no serious solutions to pressing problems -- just the fanning of resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate.""

The Republican National Committee has spent much of this week attacking Mrs. Clinton on her foreign policy record.

Her ""judgment is on trial, not her experience,"" said Richard Grennel, former spokesman for the United Nations during a Republican National Committee's news conference here. ""A surgeon who has been a surgeon for 25 years but has botched surgery should not be called a great surgeon.""

Mrs. Clinton's supporters hope highlighting her experience on foreign policy and national security issues at a time of rising anxiety over terrorism could swing to her voters considering Mr. Trump.

Polls show voters have more confidence in Mrs. Clinton as a world leader. Asked in a June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll which candidate would be better at handling foreign policy, 30% of voters said Mr. Trump and 54% said Mrs. Clinton.

On which candidate would be better as commander in chief, 32% said Mr. Trump and 44% said Mrs. Clinton. But on homeland security and combating terrorism, Mr. Trump was favored 44% to 39%.

Mr. Trump, in his GOP convention acceptance speech last week in Cleveland, set a dark tone with dire warnings of national and international peril. Mr. Obama, by contrast, said ""I am more optimistic about the future of America than ever before.""

After Mr. Obama wound up his speech declaring, ""I'm ready to pass the baton,"" Mrs. Clinton walked onto the stage. The two onetime rivals warmly embraced, waved to the cheering crowd and held hands to raise their fists in the air as Stevie Wonder's ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours"" played. They exited the stage with their arms around each other's waists.
","President Obama delivered a stirring valedictory address at the Democratic convention Wednesday night, hailing Hillary Clinton as his rightful political heir and the party's best hope to protect democracy from ""homegrown demagogues"" like the Republican Donald J. Trump.

Taking the stage to rapturous roars of ""We love you"" and ""Yes we can,"" Mr. Obama acknowledged that Democrats were still divided after a bruising nomination fight and that Mrs. Clinton had made ""mistakes.""

But he vouched passionately for Mrs. Clinton as a trusted and reliable ally not just for him but for all Americans who need a fighter to improve their lives and keep them safe.

""She's been there for us -- even if we haven't always noticed -- and if you're serious about our democracy, you can't afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue,"" Mr. Obama said, an explicit appeal to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders who continue to resist Mrs. Clinton.

Mr. Obama offered an optimistic portrait of America and a strong defense of his policies, but also unleashed by far his most ferocious attack yet on Mr. Trump, even portraying the Republican nominee as a threat to the country. ""That's why anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end,"" he said.

In the most unmistakable declaration yet by Mrs. Clinton that she is effectively seeking Mr. Obama's third term, she strolled on stage after his speech and embraced the president as the delegates roared. It was a tableau of continuity and a vivid illustration of how dependent the two former rivals are on each other now.

Mr. Obama also used his own remarks to try to drive a wedge between Mr. Trump's campaign and Republican voters. ""It wasn't particularly Republican and it sure wasn't conservative,"" he said of last week's Republican convention. ""There were no serious solutions to pressing problems. Just the fanning of resentments and blame and hate and anger.""

The president's contempt for Mr. Trump took on a personal dimension as well when he recalled his grandparents from Kansas and said, ""I don't know if they had their birth certificates"" -- a reference to Mr. Trump's leadership of the so-called birther movement that raised questions about Mr. Obama's citizenship.

Wednesday signaled a transition for the party. Emotion suffused the convention hall: Some delegates, in tears, were not ready to say goodbye to Mr. Obama yet, and others -- particularly some liberals and young Democrats -- were not ready to accept Mrs. Clinton as their new leader. As she prepares to give her nomination acceptance speech on Thursday night, the left wing of the party still remains divided, while many Republicans appear ready to fall in line behind Mr. Trump.

Mr. Obama's speech, a passionate defense of Mrs. Clinton's vision and character, did not itself herald the start of new political era. Mrs. Clinton has wrapped herself in the cloth of the Obama presidency rather than break with him and offer a new path, like Vice President George Bush's promise of ""a kinder, gentler nation"" in 1988 after the Reagan years.

Instead, the lineup on Wednesday reflected a party attempting to rally its own partisans and attract Republicans with blunt warnings that, whatever they may think about the new Democratic standard-bearer, they must all do their duty to thwart Mr. Trump.

And the convention speeches were full of cross-party appeals, as Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, offered Republicans ""a home"" if they felt Mr. Trump did not represent ""the party of Lincoln,"" and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York urged independents to vote for ""a sane, competent person"" -- Mrs. Clinton.

Mr. Kaine, a first-term senator and a former governor of Virginia, introduced himself to his largest television audience yet as a product of a Jesuit high school who embraced its motto -- ""Men for others"" -- who held close to his faith while trying to help Americans as a civil rights lawyer and then as a political leader whose most searing experience was the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007. He occasionally shifted to Spanish, which he speaks fluently, and led the audience in a chant of an Obama political slogan, ""SÃ­ se puede"" (""Yes you can"").

Mr. Kaine paid brief tribute to Republicans and also hailed Senator Bernie Sanders, whom Mrs. Clinton defeated for the nomination, at several points.

Yet some Sanders supporters were not willing to fall behind the new vice-presidential nominee. As Mr. Kaine spoke, jeers broke out from the Utah delegation attacking the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that the senator has supported and Mr. Sanders is against -- and Mrs. Clinton has shifted to oppose. Placards denouncing the trade deal quickly spread through the hall, including a couple of dozen in the California delegation.

Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and C.I.A. chief, spoke early in the evening and was repeatedly interrupted with shouts of ""No more war!"" from several state delegations that favored the candidacy of Mr. Sanders during the presidential race. As the heckling persisted, Mrs. Clinton's supporters took up a counter-chant heard more often at the Republican convention to drown out the jeers: ""U.S.A., U.S.A.!""

Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also turned to images and language more commonly used by the right to depict Mr. Trump as denigrating American greatness, invoking patriotism and saluting military service.

Before Mr. Obama even entered the convention hall here, the audience was clearly as devoted to him as they were excited for Mrs. Clinton. The first lady, Michelle Obama, was received with adoration and her speech on Monday was the most talked-about moment of the first days of the convention. And even a quick flash of Mr. Obama's face, amid a procession of past presidents on the convention screen Tuesday, brought a burst of applause.

The president is also the strongest adhesive holding Democrats together after five months of bitterly fought primary and caucus contests between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders of Vermont. According to a New York Times-CBS poll earlier this month, 82 percent of Sanders supporters approved of Mr. Obama's job performance.

After two nights of convention speeches focused on Mrs. Clinton's virtues and attempts to make peace with Sanders supporters, Clinton campaign officials sought to address the threat of radical Islamists -- an omission early on that Republicans had criticized. And in a shift from only about a decade ago when they largely avoided the issue, Democrats used much of Wednesday to advocate gun control, sending relatives of those murdered in Newtown, Conn., and Charleston, S.C., as well as a former congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, to recount their stories.

But virtually all of the anticipation on Wednesday surrounded Mr. Obama and the symbolic passing of the torch to Mrs. Clinton after she became the party's nominee on Tuesday night.

Mr. Obama's resounding endorsement of his one-time rival was the final consummation of a political alliance over a decade in the making, since Mrs. Clinton flew to Chicago in 2004 to raise money for a 42-year-old state senator and discovered a phenom.

Back then he was the one who benefited from the imprimatur of a well-established political star, and her support continued to prove critical over the years. After he won the presidential nomination that she expected to be hers in 2008, Mrs. Clinton put aside her resentment and helped him unify a divided Democratic Party. And later that year, she again came to his aid by agreeing to become his first secretary of state.

Mr. Obama is the one riding high now, his approval rating over 50 percent. And his image is only enhanced as voters view him, in his final months as president, through the prism of a race to replace him that features two deeply unpopular candidates.

While acknowledging that Mrs. Clinton has ""her share of critics"" on the right and the left, the president sought to transfer his prestige and political appeal to his long ago rival.

""Tonight, I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me,"" he said. ""I ask you to carry her the same way you carried me.""

""And if you're serious about our democracy, you can't afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue. You've got to get in the arena with her, because democracy isn't a spectator sport. America isn't about 'Yes he will.' It's about 'Yes we can.""'

97,97,2016-08-17-BatonRougeFloods.txt,"Well, to begin with, I just want to say thank you to the outstanding officials behind me who have been on the ground, working 24/7 since this flood happened.  It begins with outstanding leadership from the top -- with Governor John Bel Edwards.  And we very much appreciate all the outstanding work heâs done.  His better half, the First Lady of Louisiana, I know has been by his side every step of the way, and we are grateful for her.  I know theyâve got their own cleaning-up to do because the Governorâs Mansion was flooded as well.

In addition, I want to acknowledge Senator Bill Cassidy; Senator David Vitter; Representative Garret Graves; Representative Cedric Richmond; the Mayor of Baton Rouge, Kip Holden; and somebody who I can't brag enough about, one of the best hires I made as President -- the Administrator of FEMA, Craig Fugate, who has done such an outstanding job not just in dealing with this particular incident, but has really rebuilt FEMA so that thereâs a change of culture.  And everybody knows that when a disaster happens, FEMA is going to be there on the ground, cooperating with state and local officials rapidly and with attention to detail, and keeping the families whoâve been affected uppermost in their minds.  So we very much appreciate everything Craig has done.

It's hard, by the way, for Craig to be here because heâs a Florida Gator -- and heâs been seeing a lot of LSU T-shirts as we've been passing by.

I just had a chance to see some of the damage from the historic floods here in Louisiana.  I come here, first and foremost, to say that the prayers of the entire nation are with everybody who lost loved ones.  We are heartbroken by the loss of life.  There are also people who are still desperately trying to track down friends and family.  Weâre going to keep on helping them every way that we can.

As I think anybody who can see just the streets, much less the inside of the homes here, peopleâs lives have been upended by this flood.  Local businesses have suffered some terrible damage. Families have, in some cases, lost homes.  Theyâve certainly lost possessions, priceless keepsakes.  I was just speaking to a young woman whose husband died shortly after the birth of her second child, and she was talking about how her daughter was trying to gather all the keepsakes that she had in her bedroom, but reminded her of her father.  And that gives you some sense that this is not just about property damage.  This is about peopleâs roots.

You also have a situation where there are a lot of kids who are supposed to start a new school year, and theyâre going to need some special help and support for a while.

Sometimes when these kinds of things happen, it can seem a little bit too much to bear.  But what I want the people of Louisiana to know is that youâre not alone on this.  Even after the TV cameras leave, the whole country is going to continue to support you and help you until we get folks back in their homes and lives are rebuilt.

And the reason I can say that with confidence is because that's what Americans do in times like this.  I saw it when I visited displaced Louisianans when I came down here as a senator after Katrina.  I saw it when I visited New Orleans for the 10th anniversary last year.  I know how resilient the people of Louisiana are, and I know that you will rebuild again.  And what I've seen today proves it.

I want to thank all the first responders, the National Guard, all the good neighbors who were in a boat, going around and making sure people were safe, showing extraordinary heroism  -- in some cases, risking their own lives.  Governor Edwards, the state of Louisiana, the city, the parish governments, theyâve all stepped up under incredibly difficult circumstances.

I just want to thank the people on this block.  As I was walking down, one woman at the end, elderly, she was on her own. She had just lost her daughter.  But you had a young man next door who was helping out his father, but had also offered to help out that neighbor, so that she could salvage as much as she could and start the process of rebuilding.

With respect to the federal response, over a week ago I directed the federal government to mobilize and do everything we could to help. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate arrived here a week ago to help lead that effort.  Secretary of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson visited last week to make sure state and local officials are getting what they need.

To give you a sense of the magnitude of the situation here, more than 100,000 people have applied for federal assistance so far.  As of today, federal support has reached $127 million.  Thatâs for help like temporary rental assistance, essential home repairs, and flood insurance payments.

FEMA is also working with Louisiana around the clock to help people who were displaced by floods find temporary housing.  And any Louisiana family that needs help, you can find your nearest disaster recovery center by visiting FEMA.gov, or calling 1-800-621-FEMA.  Iâm going to repeat that:  FEMA.gov, or 1-800-621-FEMA.

Now, federal assistance alone is not going to be enough to make peopleâs lives whole again.  So Iâm asking every American to do what you can to help get families and local businesses back on their feet.  If you want help -- if you want to help, Governor Edwards put together some ways to start at VolunteerLouisiana.gov.  Thatâs VolunteerLouisiana.gov.

And the reason this is important is because even though federal money is moving out, volunteer help actually helps the state because it can offset some of its costs.  Obviously, private donations are going to be extremely important, as well.  We want to thank the Red Cross for everything theyâre doing, but there are a lot of private, philanthropic organizations, churches, parishes around the state and around the country who want to help, as well.  And that how weâre going to make sure that everybody is able to get back on their feet.

So let me just remind folks:  Sometimes once the floodwaters pass, peopleâs attention spans pass.  This is not a one-off.  This is not a photo op issue.  This is, how do you make sure that a month from now, three months from now, six months from now, people still are getting the help that they need.  I need all Americans to stay focused on this.  If youâre watching this today, make sure that you find out how you can help.  You can go to VolunteerLouisiana.gov, or you can go to FEMA.gov.  Weâll tell you, weâll direct you -- you can go to WhiteHouse.gov, and weâll direct you how you can help.

But weâre going to need to stay on this, because these are some good people down here.  Weâre glad that the families I had a chance to meet are safe, but theyâve got a lot of work to do, and they shouldnât have to do it alone.

 

All right?  Thank you very much, everybody.  God bless.

Question:  With the damage youâve seen, what more help may they need from Congress in terms of emergency spending?

President Obama:  You know, we discussed that on the way down here.  What you have is the Stafford Act provides a certain match.  A lot of the homes have flood insurance, but a lot of homes donât.  And what Craig Fugate is doing, what I instructed him to do from the start, is letâs get money out as fast as we can.  Because we know that thereâs going to be a certain amount of assistance thatâs going to be forthcoming, so thereâs no point in waiting.  We kind of make initial estimates and we start pushing stuff out.  That helps us and helps the Governor and all these officials here do their jobs.

And then what we have to do is, as we fine-tune exactly whatâs needed -- when we know, for example, how much permanent housing is going to have to be built, when we have a better sense of how much infrastructure has been damaged, what more we need to do in terms of mitigation strategies -- thatâs when Congress I think may be called upon to do some more.

Now, the good news is, is that youâve got four members of Congress right here, and a number of them happen to be in the majority, so I suspect that they may be able to talk to the Speaker and talk to Mitch McConnell.  But in part because of the fine stewardship at FEMA and, frankly, because weâve been a little lucky so far -- and Iâm going to knock on some wood -- in terms of the amount of money thatâs gone out this year, FEMA has enough money for now to cover the costs that can be absorbed.

The issue is going to be less what we need to do in terms of paying for the short term; itâs going to be the medium-term and the long-term rebuilding.  Congress should be back in session right after Labor Day.  By that time weâll probably have a better assessment.  And in the meantime, lawyers at FEMA will be examining what statutory flexibility weâve got. And I know the Governor has been right on top of making sure that Louisiana gets everything that it can get in order to help rebuild.

Question:  Mr. President, do you worry about that process becoming politicized and the trip here becoming politicized?

President Obama:  No, I donât.  First of all, one of the benefits of being five months short of leaving here is I donât worry too much about politics.

The second thing I have seen, historically, is that when disasters strike, thatâs probably one of the few times where Washington tends not to get political.  I guarantee you nobody on this block, none of those first responders, nobody gives a hoot whether youâre Democrat or Republican.  What they care about is making sure theyâre getting the drywall out and the carpet out, and thereâs not any mold building, and they get some contractors in here and they start rebuilding as quick as possible.  Thatâs what they care about.  Thatâs what I care about.

So we want to make sure that we do it right.  We want to make sure that we do it systematically.  But the one thing I just want to repeat is how proud I am of FEMA.  Because if you think about the number of significant natural disasters that have occurred since my presidency began, youâd be hard-pressed to find a local official anywhere in the country, including those in the other party, who wouldnât say that Craig Fugate and his team have been anything less than exemplary and professional.

And one of the things I did when I walked through each of these homes was ask, have you contacted FEMA?  Have you filed?  And uniformly they said that they had been in touch with FEMA; they had acted professionally; some of them had already been out here for inspections.

And I think that does indicate why itâs important for us to take the federal government seriously, federal workers seriously. Thereâs a tendency sometimes for us to bash them and to think that theyâre these faceless bureaucrats.  But when you get into trouble, you want somebody who knows what theyâre doing whoâs on the ground working with outstanding officials.  And thatâs true whatever party.  And I could not be prouder of the work that FEMA has done.

That doesnât mean that there arenât going to still be folks who need more help, and that weâre not going to have some constraints statutorily, and Congress isnât going to have to step up.  But it does mean that the basic backbone, the basic infrastructure and architecture that we have in terms of disaster response I think has been high quality.  And Iâm very proud of them for that.  And I want to publicly acknowledge that at the moment.

Thank you, guys.
","Days after floodwaters ravaged southeastern Louisiana, a picture is beginning to emerge of the extent of the devastation, even as the deluge continued to surge into other communities.

""This is a historic flooding event. We are seeing unprecedented flood levels,"" Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Tuesday.

At least 11 people died in the floods since pounding rains submerged the region over the weekend, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.

At least 40,000 homes have been damaged, Gov. Edwards said. As of Tuesday morning, about 40,000 people had registered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency seeking help, he said.

Federal officials declared 16 additional parishes as part of a federal disaster area by late Tuesday afternoon, up from four that President Barack Obama declared Sunday. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate visited the area Tuesday as 2,000 National Guard troops were called to duty.

The governor said some parts of the region -- which served as a haven for many who fled Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans 11 years ago -- were beginning to ""enter recovery mode"" even as officials continued to search for survivors and more possible fatalities.

The flooding, which has transformed miles of the state into a vast, muddy lake, was caused by heavy storms that dumped more than 2 feet of rain in some areas of Louisiana.

Many roads across the region, including major highways, remained closed Tuesday.

Louisiana is no stranger to severe storms. But Tim Destri, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Slidell, La., said the rain that fell during a 48-hour period late last week was extraordinarily heavy and widespread.

The water rushed into homes, pushing in doors, popping out windows and chasing residents up their stairs, and finally onto rescue boats. It lifted cars, and deposited them sideways in ditches. It uprooted trees and caskets, rearranging a cemetery.

""It didn't have no mercy for anything,"" said Mervin Fontenot, sifting through piles of soggy clothing and furniture in the muddy ruin of the house he and his wife had built 4 1/2 years ago.

Mr. Fontenot said water rushed into his home Saturday, sending his family -- including his 101-year-old mother-in-law, and his wife, Glenda -- fleeing by boat and jet-ski. A mud line on the walls marked the water's height at 4 feet.

By Tuesday, the water in his neighborhood had receded, leaving Mr. Fontenot and other residents to take stock of the damage -- even as thousands more braced for new flooding as the water moved past Baton Rouge.

In Ascension Parish, southeast of Baton Rouge, the Amite River and other waterways overflowed and spread. Officials declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew and distributed sandbags for people to pile up around their houses. All schools were closed.

In Sorrento, a town of about 1,500 between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Mayor Mike Lambert said that by late Tuesday morning 25% to 30% of the homes were inundated.

Closer to Baton Rouge, people began inspecting their losses.

""Yesterday, I was watching my life go out in the garbage,"" said Kay Myers, who emptied her log cabin house of ruined belongings Tuesday. Ms. Myers, 61, who lived in the home 39 years, said many residents were unprepared for how fast the floodwaters rushed in.

Most of Denham Springs, a city of about 10,000 east of Baton Rouge, was damaged. By Tuesday morning, much of the water had receded, leaving behind abandoned cars smeared with dirt along the roads. Homeowners piled foul-smelling furniture, carpeting and other ruined household items along the streets.

Janice Wheat, a manager at a Dollar General store in Denham Springs, spent the morning trying to clean up the wreckage left by 2 feet of water that swept through the building -- and then from looters, who kicked in a window and rummaged through the store.

""I can understand flooding, but what made me angry was the break-in. It wouldn't have been so bad if they hadn't done this,"" she said.

People who had fled to shelters or to stay with relatives returned home to see what they could salvage.

Mr. Fontenot and his wife, Glenda, both 69, were enjoying retirement and raising chickens in the house they had built. On Tuesday, their chicken coop was still standing, but 14 of their 15 chickens had drowned, many of their bloated bodies floating in a ditch.

Along the driveway of the one-story home, family members and friends piled up chairs, clothes, desks, a couch, lamps and other waterlogged items. The couple hopes that FEMA will help with repairs as they lack flood insurance.

As he stood in the 90-degree heat, Mr. Fontenot said he hadn't had time to become distraught. ""The emotion hasn't kicked in yet,"" he said. ""It's there. It just hasn't come out.""

The Fontenots have renamed the one chicken that survived. It used to be call Hard Head. Now it's called Lucky.
","Kathryn Morgan, 18, stood on the shore of the neighborhood, waiting for a boat and taking stock.

Home, truck, school, workplace, her friends' homes: all gone, flooded out. There was less certainty about the fate of her dog, left days ago with some food in a portable kennel. Or the bassinet and piles of baby clothes left behind when she and her 5-week-old daughter, Charlie, were picked up in a boat and taken to the safe and dry second story of her godmother's home.

""It's Louisiana, we always expect the ditches to fill when it rains,"" said Ms. Morgan, who was returning from the first supply run in three days. This was not just the ditches. ""It's like a hurricane,"" she said. ""But without any warning.""

As the receding floodwaters continued to expose the magnitude of the disaster the state has been enduring, Louisiana officials said Tuesday that at least 11 people had died, and that about 30,000 people had been rescued. Gov. John Bel Edwards acknowledged that the state did not know how many people were missing, but he said that nearly 8,100 people had slept in shelters on Monday night and that some 40,000 homes had been ""impacted to varying degrees.""

""We are still very much in an emergency, search-and-rescue response mode for much of the Florida parishes,"" Mr. Edwards said, referring to an eight-parish area east of the Mississippi River. ""Saving life is the most important priority that we have. We're going to dedicate every available response to that effort until it's no longer required.""

In Louisiana, severe weather can often seem a trauma visited and revisited. But the disaster unfolding here this week fits into a recent and staggering pattern in more than half-dozen states, where floods have rolled out at such a scale that scientists say they might be a once-every-500-or-1,000-year occurrence. The cumulative, increasingly grim toll, from Maryland to South Carolina to Louisiana to Texas, includes scores of lives and billions of dollars in economic losses.

Everywhere the same refrain -- that it has never happened like this -- has given rise to the same question: How should communities and families plan for deluges that are theoretically uncommon but now seem to play out with appalling regularity?

""We've clearly had a rash of these things in the last year; in the last 12 months, it's just been incredible,"" said Barry D. Keim, Louisiana's state climatologist. ""We're learning a lot, but, unfortunately, it's flooding a lot of people and causing a lot of problems.""

In Livingston Parish, which recorded more than 25 inches of rain in three days, unearthed coffins floated down main streets, and elementary schools became islands of shelter. The parish president's house was flooded out, even though the house was not located in the federally designated flood zone when he moved into it -- two weeks ago.

""Grab what you can and get out,"" is what the president, Layton Ricks, recalled a man telling him as he stood in the deepening lake of his driveway on Friday night. ""This is going under.""

In an interview at the parish government building, Mr. Ricks played down his troubles, talking instead, between catches in his voice, of the staggering challenges faced by the poor and newly homeless of his parish.

""What do they do?"" he said, asking for them as much as for himself as the parish's chief executive. ""It's ungodly what happened.""

After the interview, Mr. Ricks walked down the hallway to a small gathering of senior state and parish law enforcement officials. They hugged, and some wept.

Just to the west in Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital, federal and state officials also grappled Tuesday with how to manage the fallout from the unnamed storm system that experts said carried enough precipitation to rival a hurricane.

The administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, W. Craig Fugate, described the situation in Louisiana as ""a very large disaster,"" and the East Baton Rouge Parish authorities imposed a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Residents of 20 parishes are already eligible for federal disaster assistance.

As Louisiana on Tuesday faced its second catastrophic flood in about five months, climate scientists elsewhere cautioned that the state was unlikely to be the last to confront a disaster like this one.

""There's definitely an increase in heavy rainfall due to climate change,"" said John Nielsen-Gammon, the state climatologist in Texas. ""The actual increase from place to place is going to be variable because of the randomness of the weather. Some places will see a dramatic change.""

The blend of climate change and development in new areas has led to particularly dire flooding in places where storm-water systems were designed by people who were ""assuming it was always going to rain the same way as 40 years ago,"" said J. Marshall Shepherd, a professor at the University of Georgia and a former president of the American Meteorological Society.

Despite years of warnings, and long histories of planning for emergencies, officials in saturated cities and counties have often found themselves responding to far graver challenges than they imagined. A strategy for a flash flood that comes and goes within hours can hardly keep pace when record rains fall, and plans for action are often refined on the fly.

""We had a template before this disaster even happened,"" said Allan H. Kittleman, the county executive in Howard County, Md., which had severe flooding last month. ""Of course, you have to tweak it.""

In Louisiana on Tuesday, the miseries varied by geography. In Ascension Parish, officials were still handing out sandbags and urging evacuations. In Baton Rouge, the chore for emergency workers was going door to door to find the unreported missing, injured or dead. In Livingston Parish, the task had changed from a frantic flight to safety to attempts at return that were expected to end in heartbreak.

""It's not an emergency now,"" said David Truxillo, 51, who pulled up to a submerged road with his wife, both of them with pistols on their hips and both debating whether a truck could make it through the water at this height (it could not, they decided).

""It's trying to see what we got left,"" his wife, Tina, said. Definitely not the beehives in the backyard, the motorcycles, the camper or the shed. Maybe not the house.

In a subdivision across this slowly resurfacing town, a team of family and friends were helping drag everything out of Jim Bridges's waterlogged house, to which he had finally returned on Tuesday afternoon. Chairs, a television, beds, books, a piano, all of it in a long pile, like a barricade stretching across the front lawn.

""For us to flood, half of Denham would have to flood,"" Mr. Bridges, 70, recalled telling a concerned new neighbor a few years ago. He sighed. ""A lot more than half of Denham flooded.""

98,98,2016-09-05-G20Summit.txt," Good evening, everybody.  Let me begin by thanking President Xi and the people of Hangzhou and China for the hospitality in hosting this G20 summit on the shores of beautiful West Lake.  Thank you so much.  Xie xie.

This visit offered the eighth opportunity for President Xi and me to meet.  We agreed to advance our cooperation across a range of issues, including climate change, global health and development, peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, and nuclear security.  We also addressed our differences on issues like religious freedom, maritime security, and a level economic playing field, but we did so in a clear, candid, direct, and I think constructive way.  That has helped us to manage problems, and itâs consistently helped us to improve relations between the United States and China.

This has also been my tenth and final G20 meeting.  It goes by fast.  And so before I take your questions, let me put into context what weâve done over the course of our G20 meetings.

And I think back to April 2009, when hundreds of thousands of Americans were losing their jobs and their homes and their savings each month, and unemployment was on its way to 10 percent.  Around the world, for the first time in a generation, the global economy was contracting, trade was shrinking, and the international financial system was nearly frozen.  By several key measures, the global economy was on a worse trajectory than it was at the outset of the Great Depression.

But the size and the scope of the crisis was not what made that London G20 historic.  What made it historic was the speed and magnitude of our collective response.  One nation couldnât solve the problem alone, so together, developed and developing nations alike, took a comprehensive and unprecedented set of actions to prevent another depression and set the stage for recovery.

Most important was to create jobs and growth by stimulating demand across our economies.  And America led the way.  By then, in just my first 10 or so weeks as President, we had already passed the Recovery Act, set in motion plans to rescue our auto industry, stabilize our banks, jumpstart loans to small businesses, and launch programs to help homeowners refinance and stay in their homes.  And our G20 partners would follow with similar actions.

To stabilize the global economy, we rejected the protectionism that could deepen the crisis.  We cooperated to keep markets open and trade finance flowing, and bolstered the international finance systemâs lending capacity to respond to countries that were hurting the most.  And to prevent future crises, we took steps to reform our financial regulatory system -- including the historic Wall Street Reform that we passed more than six years ago.

These were the actions we took in 2009.  They were actions that prevented another depression, and created conditions for the global economy to grow by more than 25 percent over the past seven years. 

What we also did, though, was to elevate the G20 to become the worldâs premier forum for international economic cooperation. And that decision allowed us, as the global recovery progressed, to take further actions to strengthen the global economy.  And thatâs what we came to Hangzhou to do.

Weâve had long debates over the years about the best ways to promote sustained growth.  But Americaâs voice in the G20 has always been one of bold action, and that stance has been backed up by our economic performance.  Since job growth turned positive in early 2010, Americaâs businesses have created more than 15 million new jobs.  Weâve cut the unemployment rate in half.  And so far this year, wages have risen by almost 3 percent, which is much faster than the pace of inflation.

But one of the things that we learned through the G20 process is that more than ever our economies are interconnected and weâve got more work to do together to keep the global economy growing.  We have to do more to grow wages faster; to shrink inequality faster; to give everybody a shot at opportunity and security in a changing economy.  And that should be the way forward for the G20 -- to make sure that the benefits of trends like globalization and technological progress are shared broadly by more workers and families who still feel like the global economy is not working for them.

And thatâs what we did here at this G20 Summit.  We committed to using all of our policy tools to promote robust, inclusive growth that creates opportunity for young people and the middle class that theyâre working to join.  We focused on making sure that businesses can compete fairly and all working families can take advantage of the new prospects the digital economy creates.  And we reaffirmed our commitment to support emerging economies through an array of development initiatives.

We also discussed ways to unlock the mutual benefits that trade provides while keeping it fair for our workers and the playing field level for our businesses.  And that includes high-standard trade agreements that actually benefit the middle class, like the TPP.  That includes working together to abstain from unfair currency practices, and address corruption and global tax evasion.  And it includes our agreement to establish a new forum to address some of the market-distorting policies in the global steel sector that have hurt workers and businesses.

We also added momentum to the fight to protect our planet for future generations.  On Saturday, the U.S. and China formally entered the Paris Agreement.  And today, the G20 welcomed efforts to enter the Paris Agreement into force by the end of this year.

So if thereâs anything that the past eight years have taught us, itâs that the complicated challenges of the 21st century cannot be met without coordinated and collective action.  Agreement is not always easy and results do not always come quickly.  Respecting different points of view; forging consensus instead of dictating terms -- that can sometimes be frustrating. But it is how progress has been won and how it will be won in the future.  Itâs how weâve come as far as we have in the eight years since the crisis affected us all.  And itâs how the G20 can make progress for all people in the years to come.

So, with that, let me take some questions.  And I will start with Roberta Rampton of Reuters.
","The Group of 20 nations is close to an agreement that would require members to subject their economic policies to a type of ""peer review,"" according to several senior G-20 officials, in a shift that would expose the U.S. and China to broad scrutiny of the way they run their economies.

Also, the G-20 heads of state will announce on Friday that the G-20 will become the permanent council for international economic cooperation, eclipsing the Group of Eight, a senior U.S. administration official said.

""It's a reflection of the world today,"" the official said Thursday night. ""It's basically pulling international cooperation into the 21st century.""

The G-8 will continue to meet on matters important to the most-developed economies, such as international security issues. But those meetings will come as world leaders converge for other events, not in major summits.

The initiative was pressed by U.S. President Barack Obama, but it satisfied the demands of Brazil, China, India and other large developing countries, which have bristled at being left out of G-8 conclaves.

Under the G-20's proposal aimed at improving coordination of global economic policymaking, the world would reduce its reliance on U.S. consumers. The Chinese would boost domestic demand, the U.S. would trim its borrowing from overseas, and the Europeans would encourage investment, said a number of G-20 officials involved in the talks.

The scope and effectiveness of the agreement -- which was expected to be signed off on by G-20 leaders on Friday -- will depend on whether and how it is enforced. The potential agreement envisions a procedure where G-20 countries assess whether each others' policies are working, and the International Monetary Fund provides technical help. Not included are any enforcement mechanisms such as sanctions or other penalties.

The reviews will assess how the policies contribute to ""strong and balanced growth"" of the world economy, a senior G-20 official said. ""Who would have thought that the Chinese would have signed up to that?"" Germany and China had expressed strong reservations about the concept.

China is ""keenly aware"" of its problem of low consumption and is promoting domestic demand and consumption, said Ma Xin, a official at the National Development and Reform Commission.

The summit is also gearing up to announce a tough approach to dealing with tax havens, according to a draft of the communique the group will present Friday, and is preparing a compromise on regulating bonuses paid to bankers and the amount of capital banks must hold.

Although the G-20 has made progress on these thorny issues, disagreement between the U.S. and European nations over revamping the governance and structure of the IMF threatens to sour the mood. In addition, divisions persist over the level of capital the world's biggest banks should hold.

On yet another issue that has stoked controversy, the G-20 will pledge to move beyond the ""name and shame"" approach on tax havens it agreed to in April, according to a draft communique. Instead, it will move toward new systems of review and countermeasures to ensure that countries that promise to abide by transparency rules actually follow through.

Final agreements won't be made until Friday after the G-20 leaders review final language and cut 11th-hour deals. In addition to the dispute over the IMF, flash points include how specific to make commitments regarding capital and executive pay.

For the G-20, reaching an agreement with concrete and specific details is a priority as the group seeks to establish itself as the coordinating body for the world's largest economies and developing countries. It has been gradually assuming that role throughout the financial crisis, but as the global economy improves, countries are starting to go their own way.

The draft communique also calls for member states to move against oil-price speculation, largely by improving energy-demand forecasting and bolstering regulation of oil-futures markets.

The section of the draft communique on energy and climate change is still under intensive negotiations with many details still to be worked out, according to people familiar with the talks.

Meeting with reporters Thursday evening, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner acknowledged differences with European countries on raising the representation of developing nations in the governance of the World Bank and IMF, a U.S. priority.

""I don't think there's anybody who does not believe this is a necessary shift,"" Mr. Geithner said. ""I think Europe recognizes that."" But a final agreement on a revamped representation structure isn't going to be reached in Pittsburgh, he said. Rather, that will be completed in negotiations at the IMF set to conclude by January 2011.

In an area of particular interest to European nations -- tax havens -- the group appears to have made substantial progress.

""We're committed to maintain momentum in dealing with tax havens, money laundering, terrorist financing and prudential standards,"" said the draft communique. ""We stand ready to use countermeasures against tax havens from March 2010.""

Countermeasures could include allowing countries to band together to not accept tax deductions routed through jurisdictions determined to be out of compliance with the tax-haven standards.

The G-20 has focused much of its efforts in three areas: U.S. and British plans to get G-20 nations to remake economic policies to produce sustainable growth; financial regulations concerning executive compensation and bank capital; and restructuring the IMF so developing nations have a greater say.

The U.S. has proposed a five-percentage-point shift in the ownership of the IMF from industrialized to developing countries, and a cut in the number of IMF directors to 20 from 24. The loss in power would come from European nations, whose global economic clout has shrunk over the past two decades.

On the issue of financial regulation, G-20 leaders are likely to use a report by the Financial Stability Board, a group of central bankers and regulators, to work out a compromise.

The U.S. has pushed to require banks to have more capital, which European countries have said would hurt their firms. Europe, meanwhile, has pushed for tighter restrictions on executive compensation, in particular bonuses, than the U.S. wants.

The FSB's report, which will be presented at Friday's summit, will say the issues are two sides of the same coin.

According to people familiar with the matter, the group will urge banks to make sure their bonus payouts don't jeopardize their ability to keep enough capital on hand against future losses. National regulators should step in to limit a firm's bonus pool as a percentage of its revenue if that balance isn't maintained. It's unclear what, if any, sanctions might apply to banks that don't comply, however.

The report will also recommend that bonuses be reduced -- or even claimed back after being awarded -- if a bank's performance suffers, the people familiar with the matter said.

The announcement regarding the G-8 will clarify the future of what has become a round robin of economic summits. In the past year, the G-20 has met three times, in Washington, London and Pittsburgh. The G-8 met once, in Italy, but that summit included multiple iterations, such as the group of eight largest economies, the G-8 plus Egypt, the G-8 plus five other developing countries, the Major Economies Forum, and others. At that time, Mr. Obama expressed his annoyance, saying the system had to be streamlined.


","When Air Force One taxied to a stop here on Saturday afternoon, American and Chinese officials had already engaged in a lengthy, heated dispute over the most mundane of issues: How would the president depart his plane?

China's handling of President Obama's arrival for the Group of 20 summit meeting here has created a narrative that the Chinese snubbed the American president. The reality, American officials and diplomats familiar with China say, is both simpler and more complicated.

The United States military had flown in a set of rolling air stairs, as it does on all of Mr. Obama's foreign trips, and the White House had received Chinese approval to use the equipment. But before Mr. Obama's arrival, a senior administration official said, the Chinese suddenly reversed themselves.

The Americans were willing to use a Chinese stairway, this official said, but the Chinese insisted that the stairs be taken to the plane by a local driver, who the Americans said could not communicate with the White House team about even the simplest tasks. So the White House demanded that he be replaced with an English-speaking driver, a request the Chinese refused.

As Air Force One was landing, the Chinese relented and told the Americans they could use their own stairs. But by then, officials said, there was no time to make a switch.

So the White House decided to forgo the main doorway in favor of a smaller exit in the belly of the aircraft equipped with its own foldout stairs. Mr. Obama generally uses that door only when Air Force One arrives in places, like Afghanistan, with high security concerns.

The decision deprived the president of the grand display of descending the stairs from the main doorway to a red carpet. (The carpet was there, but easy to miss, as was Mr. Obama, who popped out as if he were getting off a commuter flight at a municipal airport.)

The president walked into a chaotic scene, with Chinese security officials roping off members of the White House press corps to prevent them from recording his arrival. Even the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, was hassled by security officials.

Clashes between China and the United States over the security and staging of Mr. Obama's visits have been a feature of every trip he has made here since November 2009. While few people believe that President Xi Jinping issued the order to rebuff the American request on the stairs, the impasse embodies a kind of nationalist pride and defiance toward the United States that has deepened in the years Mr. Xi has been in power.

""It's part of a nationalist culture that he is imparting throughout China at every level: 'The U.S. does not tell us what to do,""' said Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China.

Mr. Guajardo said he had been on the receiving end of extreme demands from the Chinese when he worked with them during a Group of 20 conference in Los Cabos, Mexico, in 2012. ""The driver-staircase issue is a way to take a stance and make the Chinese people proud that they're not pushovers,"" he said.

Administration officials disputed the suggestion that the staircase incident was part of a broader attempt to humiliate Mr. Obama. Instead, they said, it reflected how on edge the Chinese have been in hosting the Group of 20, a major summit meeting involving dozens of world leaders.

The authorities largely emptied this city of 10 million before the meeting, paying the residents to take vacations. Hangzhou is a provincial capital, officials noted, so it does not have the experience of dealing with visiting V.I.P.s that Beijing or even Shanghai has.

The Chinese authorities have also placed extraordinary limitations on news media access to Mr. Obama while he is here. The White House press corps, which normally has access to the president's public events wherever he travels, has been sequestered in buses 200 yards from the site of the Group of 20, without access to food or toilets.

Mr. Obama played down the incident, saying it was part of the normal give-and-take over security and media access that the United States has with many foreign countries.

He noted that foreign delegations often feel bruised by their treatment when they visit the United States. And he acknowledged that the White House places a lot of demands on countries he visits because of the size of his entourage and his security demands.

""Part of it is we also have a much bigger footprint than a lot of other countries,"" Mr. Obama said. ""We've got a lot of planes and a lot of helicopters and a lot of cars and a lot of guys, and if you're a host country, sometimes it may feel a little bit much.""

Still, with China, the president acknowledged, ""the seams are showing a little more than usual in terms of some of the negotiations and jostling that takes place behind the scenes.""

99,99,2016-11-09-PresidentialElection.txt,"Good afternoon, everybody.

Yesterday, before votes were tallied, I shot a video that some of you may have seen in which I said to the American people, regardless of which side you were on in the election, regardless of whether your candidate won or lost, the sun would come up in the morning.

And that is one bit of prognosticating that actually came true. The sun is up. And I know everybody had a long night. I did as well. I had a chance to talk to President-elect Trump last night about 3:30 in the morning, I think it was, to congratulate him on winning the election. And I had a chance to invite him to come to the White House tomorrow to talk about making sure that there is a successful transition between our presidencies.

Now, it is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences. But remember, eight years ago President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences. But President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so that we could hit the ground running.

And one thing you realize quickly in this job is that the presidency and the vice presidency is bigger than any of us. So I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago, and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the President-elect -- because we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.

I also had a chance last night to speak with Secretary Clinton and I just had a chance to hear her remarks. I could not be prouder of her. She has lived an extraordinary life of public service. She was a great First Lady. She was an outstanding senator for the state of New York. And she could not have been a better secretary of state.

I'm proud of her. A lot of Americans look up to her. Her candidacy and nomination was historic and sends a message to our daughters all across the country that they can achieve at the highest levels of politics. And I'm absolutely confident that she and President Clinton will continue to do great work for people here in the United States and all around the world.

Now, everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team. This is an ""intramural scrimmage."" We're not Democrats first. We're not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We're patriots first.

We all what -- want what's best for this country. That's what I heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night. That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly. And I was heartened by that. That's what the country needs -- a sense of unity, a sense of inclusion, a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law, and a respect for each other.  I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition. And I certainly hope that's how his presidency has a chance to begin.

I also told my team today to keep their heads up, because the remarkable work that they have done, day in, day out, often without a lot of fanfare, often with a lot of -- a lot of attention -- work in agencies, work in obscure areas of policy that make government run better, and make it more responsive, and make it more efficient, and make it more service-friendly so that it's actually helping more people. That remarkable work has left the next President with a stronger, better country than the one that existed eight years ago.

So win or lose in this election, that was always our mission. That was our mission from day one. And everyone on my team should be extraordinarily proud of everything that they have done; and so should all the Americans that I've had a chance to meet all across this country who do the hard work of building on that progress every single day: teachers in schools, doctors in E.R. clinic, small businesses putting their all into starting something up, making sure they're treating their employees well, all the important work that's done by moms and dads and families and congregations in every state, the work of perfecting this union.

So this was a long and hard fought campaign. A lot of our fellow Americans are exalted today; a lot of Americans are less so, but that's the nature of campaigns. That's the nature of democracy. It is hard and sometimes contentious and noisy and it's not always inspiring.

But to the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know, you have to stay encouraged. Don't get cynical. Don't ever think you can't make a difference. As Secretary Clinton said this morning, fighting for what is right is worth it. Sometimes you lose an argument; sometimes you lose an election.

You know, the path that this country has taken has never been a straight line. We zig and zag and sometimes, you know, we move in ways that some people think is forward and others think is moving back, and that's okay. I've lost elections before. Joe hasn't, but, you know -- So I've been -- I've been sort of sharing --

That's the way politics works sometimes. We -- We try really hard to persuade people that we're right and then people vote. And then if we lose, we learn from our mistakes. We do some reflection. We lick our wounds. We brush ourselves off. We get back in the arena. We go at it. We try even harder the next time.

The point, though, is is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens, because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy. That's how this country has moved forward for 240 years. It's how we've pushed boundaries and promoted freedom around the world. That's how we've expanded the rights of our founding to reach all of our citizens. It's how we have come this far.

And that's why I'm confident that this incredible journey that we're on, as Americans, will go on. And I'm looking forward to doing everything that I can to make sure that the next President is successful in that.

I've said before, I think of this job as being a relay runner. You take the baton. You run your best race. And hopefully by the time you hand it off, you're a little further ahead; you've made a little progress. And I can say that we've done that, and I want to make sure that handoff is well executed because ultimately we're all on the same team.

All right? Thank you very much, everybody.
","Republican Donald Trump won the 2016 election, becoming the nation's 45th president in one of the biggest upsets in U.S. political history.

Mr. Trump reached his stunning triumph over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the early morning hours Wednesday, after a cliffhanger night of vote counting that capped the bitter, monthslong presidential contest.

Defying polls and political pundits, Mr. Trump ran up extraordinary vote totals in rural areas and working-class counties across the U.S., where his message of economic populism resonated. It was an appeal the first-time candidate used in the primaries to upend Republican Party orthodoxy and defeat 16 more experienced Republican rivals.

In the wee hours of the morning, the Associated Press projected Mr. Trump would win, after calling Wisconsin in his favor. Mrs. Clinton's path to victory was shut off when Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania, following a string of victories in the vote-rich battleground states of Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Iowa.

Mrs. Clinton racked up victories, too, in Nevada, Virginia and Colorado, battleground states that she had expected to win. But Virginia, home of her vice presidential running mate and a sitting senator Tim Kaine, went down to the wire, and many of her other wins came with tight margins after prolonged vote counts. And elsewhere, in urban areas she counted on for support from blacks and other voters, turnout fell short.

The candidates and their supporters were on an emotional roller coaster late into the evening, tracking the early neck-and-neck returns. But as the vote counting dragged into early Wednesday morning, there was a dramatic mood switch between the campaigns: The Clinton rally was ashen with the prospect of defeat; Trump supporters giddy at the turnaround.

John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, addressed her supporters after 2 a.m., before the race was called by the AP in favor of Mr. Trump. He asked for patience and conceded nothing.

""They are still counting the votes, and every vote should count,"" he said, sending supporters home for the night with a request to wait a little longer.

The election provided a historic choice: selecting the first female president in U.S. history, taking the baton of leadership from the nation's first black president, or electing a political novice on the promise of radical change.

The long night of vote counting was an appropriate end to a campaign that had turned into one of the most unpredictable in modern politics. Heading into Election Day, Mrs. Clinton had enough states locked up, according to polls, that Mr. Trump's narrow path required him to win just about every battleground state and pick up at least one Democratic-leaning state.

Mr. Trump's hopes hinged partly on the belief that polls may have underestimated his support from voters reluctant to say they were picking him, and that enthusiasm for his candidacy would give him an advantage in turnout that would be hard to measure.

Some state election officials, including those in North Carolina and New Hampshire, said they experienced a record voter turnout.

Mr. Trump benefited from efforts by the Republican National Committee, long before anyone dreamed he would win the nomination. The RNC decided to build a better ground game to catch up with the performance of Democrats in 2008 and 2012. The work proved essential because Mr. Trump won the nomination unprepared to compete on the ground with Democrats, given his minimal campaign structure and limited support from other Republicans.

Since 2013, the RNC has invested more than $175 million in voter databanks, digital technology and a political infrastructure, which was made available to the Trump campaign.

After such a long and closely fought battle, the next president faces a deeply divided nation. Both candidates were viewed negatively by a majority of voters, polls showed. To many, the presidential election was seen as a choice between the lesser of two evils.

Craig Joerres, 50 years old, of Waukesha, Wis., said he needed a glass of whiskey before voting Tuesday. ""It has been such a stressful election season,"" he said. ""Both parties had so much hate."" He said he voted for Mr. Trump to shake up Washington.

Liliana Sanchez, age 29, said she voted for Mrs. Clinton, in part, because she was repelled by Mr. Trump.

""I have a daughter who has a disability. I didn't like the way he talked about people who are disabled,"" the Colorado woman said, referring to a campaign appearance that showed Mr. Trump seemingly mock a disabled reporter. ""I'm also, of course, a woman,"" she added, ""I don't like the way he expressed himself about women.""

About 130 million Americans were expected to cast ballots in what has been one of the most unpredictable campaigns in modern history.

At stake was not only the presidency, but a vacancy on the Supreme Court, as well as control of the Senate.

At least 47 million people cast ballots in early voting across such states as Arizona, Florida and Nevada, setting records. In Florida, more than six million people voted early -- a 35% increase from 2012. In North Carolina, about half of all registered voters cast ballots early, totaling more than 3 million.

Through mid-October, the two candidates and their allies spent about $1.4 billion on campaign operations and advertising to persuade American voters.

Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump voted Tuesday morning in their home state of New York, following a frantic spate of 11th hour campaigning in battleground states that spanned New Hampshire, Nevada, Florida and Michigan.

When Mrs. Clinton voted in Chappaqua, N.Y., she spoke of her chance to make history and the enormity of the task should she win.

""I know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country and I will do the very best I can if I'm fortunate enough to win today,"" she told reporters.

Mr. Trump projected confidenceas he arrived to cast his vote at a public school in New York City.

""I'm very excited,"" he said. ""It's a great opportunity. There is tremendous enthusiasm from everybody.""

Asked if he would concede if Mrs. Clinton were declared the winner by night's end, Mr. Trump said, ""We'll see what happens.""

The presidential campaign presented voters with a contrast of visions -- both about the state of the nation and where it should head next.

Mr. Trump spoke of a country in decline, burdened by illegal immigration, poor trade deals and terrorist threats. He labeled Mrs. Clinton as ""crooked."" He called for tax cuts and promised to repeal President Barack Obama's health-care law.

The New York businessman said he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and send those living in the U.S. without permission back to their home countries.

Preliminary exit polls on Tuesday showed that voters, by a nearly three-to-one margin, preferred offering illegal immigrants a path to legal status rather than conducting mass deportations; a solid majority opposed building the wall.

Mrs. Clinton, in contrast, embraced the health care law, along with economic improvements and social changes of the past eight years. After criticizing Mr. Trump for weeks, she sought to end the campaign on an optimistic note, asking voters to choose a ""hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America.""

Faced with the chance to elect the first woman to the White House, many voters paid homage Tuesday to those who knocked down barriers in the fight for women's suffrage in the early 1900s.

Mr. Trump will leave his own stamp on political history. He mobilized millions of voters with a blunt challenge to the status quo and gave voice to the economic and political grievances of a struggling American middle class.

Those are sentiments that have been brewing for years. But they emerged with surprising force behind Mr. Trump, who was dismissed as a TV celebrity when he first announced what seemed a quixotic candidacy.
","Donald John Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States on Tuesday in a stunning culmination of an explosive, populist and polarizing campaign that took relentless aim at the institutions and long-held ideals of American democracy.

The surprise outcome, defying late polls that showed Hillary Clinton with a modest but persistent edge, threatened convulsions throughout the country and the world, where skeptics had watched with alarm as Mr. Trump's unvarnished overtures to disillusioned voters took hold.

The triumph for Mr. Trump, 70, a real estate developer-turned-reality television star with no government experience, was a powerful rejection of the establishment forces that had assembled against him, from the world of business to government, and the consensus they had forged on everything from trade to immigration.

The results amounted to a repudiation, not only of Mrs. Clinton, but of President Obama, whose legacy is suddenly imperiled. And it was a decisive demonstration of power by a largely overlooked coalition of mostly blue-collar white and working-class voters who felt that the promise of the United States had slipped their grasp amid decades of globalization and multiculturalism.

In Mr. Trump, a thrice-married Manhattanite who lives in a marble-wrapped three-story penthouse apartment on Fifth Avenue, they found an improbable champion.

""The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,"" Mr. Trump told supporters around 3 a.m. on Wednesday at a rally in New York City, just after Mrs. Clinton called to concede.

In a departure from a blistering campaign in which he repeatedly stoked division, Mr. Trump sought to do something he had conspicuously avoided as a candidate: Appeal for unity.

""Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division,"" he said. ""It is time for us to come together as one united people. It's time.""

That, he added, ""is so important to me.""

He offered unusually warm words for Mrs. Clinton, who he has suggested should be in jail, saying she was owed ""a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.""

Bolstered by Mr. Trump's strong showing, Republicans retained control of the Senate. Only one Republican-controlled seat, in Illinois, fell to Democrats early in the evening. And Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, easily won re-election in a race that had been among the country's most competitive. A handful of other Republican incumbents facing difficult races were running better than expected.

Mr. Trump's win -- stretching across the battleground states of Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- seemed likely to set off financial jitters and immediate unease among international allies, many of which were startled when Mr. Trump in his campaign cast doubt on the necessity of America's military commitments abroad and its allegiance to international economic partnerships.

From the moment he entered the campaign, with a shocking set of claims that Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals, Mr. Trump was widely underestimated as a candidate, first by his opponents for the Republican nomination and later by Mrs. Clinton, his Democratic rival. His rise was largely missed by polling organizations and data analysts. And an air of improbability trailed his campaign, to the detriment of those who dismissed his angry message, his improvisational style and his appeal to disillusioned voters.

He suggested remedies that raised questions of constitutionality, like a ban on Muslims entering the United States.

He threatened opponents, promising lawsuits against news organizations that covered him critically and women who accused him of sexual assault. At times, he simply lied.

But Mr. Trump's unfiltered rallies and unshakable self-regard attracted a zealous following, fusing unsubtle identity politics with an economic populism that often defied party doctrine.

His rallies -- furious, entertaining, heavy on name-calling and nationalist overtones -- became the nexus of a political movement, with daily promises of sweeping victory, in the election and otherwise, and an insistence that the country's political machinery was ""rigged"" against Mr. Trump and those who admired him.

He seemed to embody the success and grandeur that so many of his followers felt was missing from their own lives -- and from the country itself. And he scoffed at the poll-driven word-parsing ways of modern politics, calling them a waste of time and money. Instead, he relied on his gut.

At his victory party at the New York Hilton Midtown, where a raucous crowd indulged in a cash bar and wore hats bearing his ubiquitous campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again,"" voters expressed gratification that their voices had, at last, been heard.

""He was talking to people who weren't being spoken to,"" said Joseph Gravagna, 37, a marketing company owner from Rockland County, N.Y. ""That's how I knew he was going to win.""

For Mrs. Clinton, the defeat signaled an astonishing end to a political dynasty that has colored Democratic politics for a generation. Eight years after losing to President Obama in the Democratic primary -- and 16 years after leaving the White House for the United States Senate, as President Bill Clinton exited office -- she had seemed positioned to carry on two legacies: her husband's and the president's.

Her shocking loss was a devastating turn for the sprawling world of Clinton aides and strategists who believed they had built an electoral machine that would swamp Mr. Trump's ragtag band of loyal operatives and family members, many of whom had no experience running a national campaign.

On Tuesday night, stricken Clinton aides who believed that Mr. Trump had no mathematical path to victory, anxiously paced the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center as states in which they were confident of victory, like Florida and North Carolina, either fell to Mr. Trump or seemed in danger of tipping his way.

Mrs. Clinton watched the grim results roll in from a suite at the nearby Peninsula Hotel, surrounded by her family, friends and advisers who had the day before celebrated her candidacy with a champagne toast on her campaign plane.

But over and over, Mrs. Clinton's weaknesses as a candidate were exposed. She failed to excite voters hungry for change. She struggled to build trust with Americans who were baffled by her decision to use a private email server as secretary of state. And she strained to make a persuasive case for herself as a champion of the economically downtrodden after delivering perfunctory paid speeches that earned her millions of dollars.

The returns Tuesday also amounted to a historic rebuke of the Democratic Party from the white blue-collar voters who had formed the party base from the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt to Mr. Clinton's. Yet Mrs. Clinton and her advisers had taken for granted that states like Michigan and Wisconsin would stick with a Democratic nominee, and that she could repeat Mr. Obama's strategy of mobilizing the party's ascendant liberal coalition rather than pursuing a more moderate course like her husband did 24 years ago.

But not until these voters were offered a Republican who ran as an unapologetic populist, railing against foreign trade deals and illegal immigration, did they move so drastically away from their ancestral political home.

To the surprise of many on the left, white voters who had helped elect the nation's first black president, appeared more reluctant to line up behind a white woman.

From Pennsylvania to Wisconsin, industrial towns once full of union voters who for decades offered their votes to Democratic presidential candidates, even in the party's lean years, shifted to Mr. Trump's Republican Party. One county in the Mahoning Valley of Ohio, Trumbull, went to Mr. Trump by a six-point margin. Four years ago, Mr. Obama won there by 22 points.

Mrs. Clinton's loss was especially crushing to millions who had cheered her march toward history as, they hoped, the nation's first female president. For supporters, the election often felt like a referendum on gender progress: an opportunity to elevate a woman to the nation's top job and to repudiate a man whose remarkably boorish behavior toward women had assumed center stage during much of the campaign.

Mr. Trump boasted, in a 2005 video released last month, about using his public profile to commit sexual assault. He suggested that female political rivals lacked a presidential ""look."" He ranked women on a scale of one to 10, even holding forth on the desirability of his own daughter -- the kind of throwback male behavior that many in the country assumed would disqualify a candidate for high office.

On Tuesday, the public's verdict was rendered.

Uncertainty abounds as Mr. Trump prepares to take office. His campaign featured a shape-shifting list of policy proposals, often seeming to change hour to hour. His staff was in constant turmoil, with Mr. Trump's children serving critical campaign roles and a rotating cast of advisers alternately seeking access to Mr. Trump's ear, losing it and, often, regaining it, depending on the day.

Even Mr. Trump's full embrace of the Republican Party came exceedingly late in life, leaving members of both parties unsure about what he truly believes. He has donated heavily to both parties and has long described his politics as the transactional reality of a businessman.

Mr. Trump's dozens of business entanglements -- many of them in foreign countries -- will follow him into the Oval Office, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. His refusal to release his tax returns, and his acknowledgment that he did not pay federal income taxes for years, has left the American people with considerable gaps in their understanding of the financial dealings.

But this they do know: Mr. Trump will thoroughly reimagine the tone, standards and expectations of the presidency, molding it in his own self-aggrandizing image.

He is set to take the oath of office on Jan. 20.

100,100,2017-01-11-FarewellAddress.txt,"My fellow Americans:

Michelle and I have been so touched by all the well-wishes that weâve received over the past few weeks.  But tonight -- tonight itâs my turn to say thanks.  Whether we have seen eye-to-eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people -- in living rooms and in schools; at farms, on factory floors; at diners and on distant military outposts -- those conversations are what have kept me honest, and kept me inspired, and kept me going.  And every day, I have learned from you.  You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.

So I first came to Chicago when I was in my early 20s. And I was still trying to figure out who I was, still searching for a purpose to my life.  And it was the neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills.  It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.

Now, this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, and they get engaged, and they come together to demand it. 

After eight years as your President, I still believe that.  And itâs not just my belief. Itâs the beating heart of our American idea -- our bold experiment in self-government. Itâs the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Itâs the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing; that we, the people, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect union.

What a radical idea, the great gift that our Founders gave to us: the freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat, and toil, and imagination -- and the imperative to strive together as well, to achieve a common good, a greater good.

For 240 years, our nationâs call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation.  Itâs what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom.  Itâs what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the Rio Grande. It's what pushed women to reach for the ballot. It's what powered workers to organize.  Itâs why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima; Iraq and Afghanistan -- and why men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well. 

So -- So thatâs what we mean when we say America is exceptional.  Not that our nation's been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change, and make life better for those who follow.

Yes, our progress has been uneven.  The work of democracy has always been hard; it's always been contentious. Sometimes it's been bloody.  For every two steps forward, it often feels that we take one step back.  But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some.

If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history, if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iranâs nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9/11, if I had told you that we would win marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens -- if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high.

But thatâs what we did.

Thatâs what you did.

You were the change.

You answered peopleâs hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.

In 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy --

The peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected President to the next.  I committed to President-elect Trump that my Administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.  Because itâs up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face.

We have what we need to do so.  We have everything we need to meet those challenges. After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on Earth.  Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours.

But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works; only if our politics better reflects the decency of the our people; only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now. 

Thatâs what I want to focus on tonight: the state of our democracy.

Understand, democracy does not require uniformity.  Our Founders argued, they quarreled, eventually they compromised. They expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity -- the idea that for all our outward differences, we're all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.

There have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity.  And the beginning of this century has been one of those times: a shrinking world, growing inequality, demographic change, and the specter of terrorism. These forces havenât just tested our security and our prosperity, but are testing our democracy as well.  And how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids, and create good jobs, and protect our homeland. In other words, it will determine our future.

To begin with, our democracy wonât work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity.  And the good news is that today the economy is growing again; wages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are all rising again; poverty is falling again.  The wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records.  The unemployment rate is near a ten-year low.  The uninsured rate has never, ever been lower.  Health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years.  And I've said -- and I mean it -- if anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements weâve made to our health care system -- that covers as many people at less cost -- I will publicly support it. Because that, after all, is why we serve -- not to score points or take credit, but to make peopleâs lives better. 

But, for all the real progress that weâve made, we know itâs not enough.  Our economy doesnât work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class, and ladders for folks who want to get into the middle class. That's the economic argument, but stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic idea.  While the top one percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many of our families, in inner cities and in rural counties, have been left behind: the laid-off factory worker; the waitress or health care worker who's just barely getting by and struggling to pay the bills -- convinced that the game is fixed against them, that their government only serves the interests of the powerful. That's a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics. 

And there are no quick fixes to this long-term trend.  I agree, our trade should be fair and not just free.  But the next wave of economic dislocations wonât come from overseas.  It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle-class jobs obsolete.

And so we're going to have to forge a new social compact -- to guarantee all our kids the education they need; to -- to give workers the power to unionize for better wages; to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now, and make more reforms to the tax code so corporations and individuals who reap the most from this new economy donât avoid their obligations to the country thatâs made their very success possible.

We can argue about how to best achieve these goals.  But we canât be complacent about the goals themselves.  For if we donât create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.

Thereâs a second threat to our democracy -- and this one is as old as our nation itself.  After my election, there was talk of a ""post-racial America.""  And such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic.  Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.  Now Iâve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say. You can see it not just in statistics. You see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.

But weâre not where we need to be.  And all of us have more work to do.  If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minority, then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves.  If we're unwilling to invest in the children of immigrants just because they donât look like us, we will diminish the prospects of our own children -- because those brown kids will represent a larger and larger share of Americaâs workforce.  And we have shown that our economy doesnât have to be a zero-sum game.  Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women. 

So, if we're going to be serious about race, going forward, we need to uphold laws against discrimination -- in hiring, and in housing, and in education, and in the criminal justice system.  That is what our Constitution and our highest ideals require.  But laws alone wonât be enough.  Hearts must change.  They won't change overnight. Social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change, but if our democracy is to work the way it should in this increasingly diverse nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in American fiction -- Atticus Finch, who said âYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of viewâ¦until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.â1

For blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face -- not only the refugee, or the immigrant, or the rural poor, or the transgender American, but also the middle-aged white guy who, from the outside, may seem like he's got advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change. We have to pay attention, and listen.

For white Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn't suddenly vanish in the '60s -- that when minority groups voice discontent, they're not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness. When they wage peaceful protest, they're not demanding special treatment but the equal treatment that our Founders promised.

For native-born Americans -- For native-born Americans it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish, and Italians, and Poles -- who it was said we're going to destroy the fundamental character of America. And as it turned out, America wasn't weakened by the presence of these newcomers; these newcomers embraced this nation's creed, and this nation was strengthened.

So regardless of the station that we occupy, we all have to try harder. We all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family just like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.

And that's not easy to do. For too many of us, it's become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses, or places of worship, or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions. And the rise of naked partisanship, and increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste -- all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable. And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there. And this trend represents a third threat to our democracy.

But politics is a battle of ideas. That's how our democracy was designed. In the course of a healthy debate, we prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them. But without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter -- then we're going to keep talking past each other, and we'll make common ground and compromise impossible.

And isn't that part of what so often makes politics dispiriting? How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when we're cutting taxes for corporations? How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing? It's not just dishonest, this selective sorting of the facts; it's self-defeating. Because, as my mother used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.

Take the challenge of climate change. In just eight years, we've halved our dependence on foreign oil; we've doubled our renewable energy; we've led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet. But without bolder action, our children won't have time to debate the existence of climate change. They'll be busy dealing with its effects: more environmental disasters, more economic disruptions, waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.

Now, we -- we can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem. But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country -- the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders.

It is that spirit -- It is that spirit, born of the Enlightenment, that made us an economic powerhouse -- the spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral; the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket. 

Itâs that spirit -- a faith in reason, and enterprise, and the primacy of right over might -- that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression; that allowed us to build a post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations but built on principles -- the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion, and speech, and assembly, and an independent press.

That order is now being challenged -- first by violent fanatics who claim to speak for Islam; more recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who see free markets and open democracies and and civil society itself as a threat to their power.  The peril each poses to our democracy is more far-reaching than a car bomb or a missile.  They represent the fear of change; the fear of people who look or speak or pray differently; a contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders accountable; an intolerance of dissent and free thought; a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of whatâs true and whatâs right.

Because of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform, because of our intelligence officers, and law enforcement, and diplomats who support our troops, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years.  And although Boston and Orlando and San Bernardino and Fort Hood remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever.  We have taken out tens of thousands of terrorists -- including bin Laden.  The global coalition weâre leading against ISIL has taken out their leaders, and taken away about half their territory.  ISIL will be destroyed, and no one who threatens America will ever be safe.

And to all who serve, or have served, it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your Commander-in-Chief.  And we all owe you a deep debt of gratitude.

But protecting our way of life, that's not just the job of our military.  Democracy can buckle when it gives in to fear.  So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are.

And thatâs why, for the past eight years, Iâve worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firmer legal footing.  Thatâs why weâve ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, reformed our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties.  Thatâs why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans, who are just as patriotic as we are.

Thatâs why -- That's why we cannot withdraw -- That's why we cannot withdraw from big global fights -- to expand democracy, and human rights, and womenâs rights, and LGBT rights.  No matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem, that's part of defending America.  For the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression.  If the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world, the likelihood of war within and between nations increases, and our own freedoms will eventually be threatened.

So letâs be vigilant, but not afraid.  ISIL will try to kill innocent people.  But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight.  Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world, unless we give up what we stand for, and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.

Which brings me to my final point:  Our democracy -- Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted.  All of us, regardless of party, should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.  When voting rates in America are some of the lowest among advanced democracies, we should be making it easier, not harder, to vote.  When -- When trust in our institutions is low, we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics, and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service.  When Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our congressional districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.

But remember, none of this happens on its own.  All of this depends on our participation, on each of us accepting the responsibility of citizenship, regardless of which way the pendulum of power happens to be swinging.

Our Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift.  But itâs really just a piece of parchment.  It has no power on its own.  We, the people, give it power.  We, the people, give it meaning -- with our participation, and with the choices that we make, and the alliances that we forge; whether or not we stand up for our freedoms; whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law.  That's up to us.

America is no fragile thing.  But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.

In his own farewell address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but âfrom different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken, [many artifices employed] to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth.â  And so we have to preserve this truth with âjealous anxiety;â that we should reject âthe first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred tiesâ that make us one.

America, we weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character aren't even willing to enter into public service; so coarse with rancor that Americans with whom we disagree are seen not just as misguided but as malevolent.  We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others; when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt; and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.

It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the joyous task weâve been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours.  Because for all our outward differences, we, in fact, all share the same proud title, the most important office in a democracy: ""citizen.""

Citizen.

So, you see, thatâs what our democracy demands.  It needs you. Not just when thereâs an election; not just when your own narrow interest is at stake; but over the full span of a lifetime.  If youâre tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life.  If something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing.  If youâre disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.

Show up. Dive in. Stay at it.

Sometimes youâll win.  Sometimes youâll lose.  Presuming a reservoir of goodness in other people, that can be a risk, and there will be times when the process will disappoint you.  But for those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of this work, and to see it up close, let me tell you: It can energize and inspire.  And more often than not, your faith in America, and in Americans, will be confirmed.

Mine sure has been.  Over the course of these eight years, Iâve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers.  I have mourned with grieving families searching for answers, and found grace in a Charleston church.  Iâve seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch.  I've seen wounded warriors who at points were given up for dead walk again.  Iâve seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks.

Iâve seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees, or work for peace, and, above all, to look out for each other.   

So that faith that I placed all those years ago, not far from here, in the power of ordinary Americans to bring about change -- that faith has been rewarded in ways I could not have possibly imagined.  And I hope your faith has, too.  Some of you here tonight or watching at home, you were there with us in 2004, in 2008, 2012; maybe you still canât believe we pulled this whole thing off.  Let me tell you, you're not the only ones.

Michelle -- Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side: For the -- For the past 25 years you have not only been my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend.  You took on a role you didn't ask for. And you made it your own with grace and with grit and with style, and good humor. You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody.

And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model. So, you have made me proud, and you have made the country proud.

Malia and Sasha: Under the strangest of circumstances you have become two amazing young women. You are smart and you are beautiful. But more importantly, you are kind and you are thoughtful and you are full of passion. And yo wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I have done in my life, I am most proud to be your dad.

To Joe Biden, the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware's favorite son: You were the first decision I made as a nominee, and it was the best; not just because you have been a great Vice President, but because in the bargain I gained a brother. And we love you and Jill like family. And your friendship has been one of the great joys of our lives.

To my remarkable staff:  For eight years -- and for some of you, a whole lot more -- I have drawn from your energy, and every day I tried to reflect back what you displayed: heart, and character, and idealism.  Iâve watched you grow up, get married, have kids, start incredible new journeys of your own.  Even when times got tough and frustrating, you never let Washington get the better of you.  You guarded against cynicism.  And the only thing that makes me prouder than all the good that weâve done is the thought of all the amazing things that youâre going to achieve from here.

And to all of you out there -- every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town, every kind family who welcomed them in, every volunteer who knocked on doors, every young person who cast a ballot for the first time, every American who lived and breathed the hard work of change: You are the best supporters and organizers anybody could ever hope for, and I will be forever grateful.  Because you did change the world.  You did.

And thatâs why I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we started.  Because I know our work has not only helped so many Americans, it has inspired so many Americans, especially so many young people out there, to believe that you can make a difference, to hitch your wagon to something bigger than yourselves.

Let me tell you, this generation coming up -- unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic, Iâve seen you in every corner of the country.  You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America.  You know that constant change has been Americaâs hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace.  You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward.  Youâll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands.

My fellow Americans:

It has been the honor of my life to serve you.  I wonât stop.  In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days.  But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago:

I'm asking you to believe.

Not in my ability to bring about change -- but in yours. 

I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written:  Yes, we can.

Yes We Did! Yes We Can!

Thank you.

God bless you.

And may God continue to bless the United States of America.
","In a farewell address to a hall filled with the activists who helped him become the first black president, Barack Obama Tuesday urged Americans to unite to protect the nation's democracy, which he said is being threatened by outside forces as well as tensions within.

""There have been moments throughout our history that threatened to rupture that solidarity,"" the president said. ""The beginning of this century has been one of those times. A shrinking world, growing inequality, demographic change and the specter of terrorism -- these forces haven't just tested our security and prosperity, but our democracy as well,"" he warned.

Beyond economic and national-security threats, the president said two other forces threaten the nation's future: race relations and a hardening political divide riven by disputed facts such as the veracity of global warming and human contributions to it.

While acknowledging progress for the black community, Mr. Obama said the nation needed to do more and to broaden the discussion to include other minorities whose children also will inherit the nation.

""If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don't look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America's workforce,"" he said.

Mr. Obama addressed the country still popular among Americans. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in December found he has a 52% approval rating, with 42% disapproval.

The president's decision to deliver his speech in his hometown of Chicago, where he first addressed the country after his 2008 victory, is a departure from the traditional settings his predecessors have chosen for their farewell addresses.

Mr. Obama, who campaigned aggressively against his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, has often told his supporters that all the progress of the last eight years ""goes out the window"" if Americans elect ""somebody who has proven himself unfit to lead or represent this country that we love.""

On Tuesday, he referred just once to Mr. Trump, who has vowed to dismantle much of Mr. Obama's policies when he takes office on Jan. 20.

""I committed to President-elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me,"" Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama also defended policies he sees as the benchmarks of his legacy.

On the domestic front, that included the economy's recovery from the biggest recession since the Great Depression and his health-care law.

In terms of foreign policy, Mr. Obama pointed to the reduction of U.S. troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, although his promise to end both of those wars is unfulfilled and he has opened new military fronts against terrorist groups in other countries such as Syria, Libya and Yemen.

Mr. Obama also highlighted his re-establishment of U.S. relations with Cuba, a deal with Iran to restrain its nuclear program and an international climate-change agreement.

Mr. Trump has criticized Mr. Obama on all of those policies, although it remains unclear how he will attempt to change them.

The president, meanwhile, included a veiled bit of advice for the incoming administration. ""Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world -- unless we give up what we stand for, and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors,"" he said.
","President Obama delivered a nostalgic and hopeful farewell address to the nation on Tuesday evening, but warned both the divided country he led for eight years and his successor not to shrink from the challenges of economic inequality, racial strife, political isolation and voter apathy that still threaten its ideal of democracy.

Mr. Obama returned to the city that nurtured his political career and his improbable journey from Hyde Park to Pennsylvania Avenue, just 10 days before he will leave the White House to Donald J. Trump. In his final speech to the nation, the president expressed his belief that even the deepest ideological divides can be bridged by an active, engaged populace.

""After eight years as your president, I still believe that,"" Mr. Obama told a large crowd at McCormick Place, the cavernous lakeside convention center where he thanked supporters after his re-election in 2012. ""And it's not just my belief. It's the beating heart of our American idea -- our bold experiment in self-government.""

Tearing up as he concluded the final speech of a remarkable political career, Mr. Obama thanked his wife, his daughters, his vice president (""the scrappy kid from Scranton"") and the army of supporters who helped sweep the first African-American into the White House.

""I won't stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain,"" Mr. Obama pledged, fighting back emotion as audience members rose to their feet. He asked them to believe, as they did during his first campaign. ""Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can.""

But a president who rode an exhortation of hope and change to the Oval Office delivered a final speech to the country built around the need to confront a changing world and nation.

Mr. Obama urged the country to deal with the persistent problems that undermine the equality, diversity and unity that he sought to achieve during his tenure. He said economic inequality would continue to cause ""disaffection and division"" and warned that race would remain a potent force dividing the nation unless discrimination is attacked and eliminated.

""But laws alone won't be enough. Hearts must change,"" he told the crowd. ""When minority groups voice discontent, they're not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness; that when they wage peaceful protest, they're not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment our founders promised.""

The president said that a splintered news media threatened democracy by allowing people to retreat into their own bubbles of knowledge, everyone certain of a different set of facts. ""We become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that's out there,"" he said.

And, the president said, the country's democratic order is threatened by a sense of apathy among the many Americans who do not vote or participate in civic life. He urged members of both political parties to work to restore trust in society's institutions in ways that will attract more people to become involved in the country's fate.

""If something needs fixing, lace up your shoes and do some organizing,"" Mr. Obama, a onetime community organizer, told the crowd. ""If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Persevere. Sometimes you'll win. Sometimes you'll lose.""

But, he added: ""More often than not, your faith in America -- and in Americans -- will be confirmed.""

Eight years ago, Mr. Obama basked in the glow of his history-making victory that drew nearly a quarter-million people to a jubilant celebration in the city's nearby Grant Park. On Tuesday night, visibly older and chastened by years of political battles in Washington, Mr. Obama returned to his adopted hometown to bring his tenure to an end.

""You are the best supporters and organizers anyone could hope for, and I will forever be grateful. Because yes, you changed the world,"" Mr. Obama said. ""I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than I was when we started.""

But that expression of hope was tempered by the reality playing out in the nation's capital: Mr. Trump has promised to unwind Mr. Obama's legacy, erasing the president's disciplined and professorial approach to governing with a noisy, chaotic style of leadership. Even as Mr. Obama took the stage, another controversy dogged Mr. Trump even before his inauguration as unverified allegations about his personal behavior emerged in news reports.

Mr. Obama said he had committed to ensuring Mr. Trump ""the smoothest possible transition,"" drawing boos from a crowd clearly not ready to see that happen; at one point, they began chanting, ""Four more years."" Mr. Obama dismissed them quickly, though. ""I can't do that,"" he said.

In parts of the speech, Mr. Obama appeared to be talking to Mr. Trump as much as the rest of America, warning him of the dangers of continuing to stoke the divisions that helped Republicans defeat Hillary Clinton in the presidential campaign.

""That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans,"" Mr. Obama said to huge cheers from the adoring crowd. ""That's why we cannot withdraw from global fights -- to expand democracy, and human rights, women's rights, and L.G.B.T. rights -- no matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem.""

To a successor who has often questioned the reality of climate change, Mr. Obama seemed to say: Be careful.

""We can and should argue about the best approach to the problem,"" he said. ""But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations; it betrays the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our founders.""

For many Chicago residents, who embrace Mr. Obama as one of their own, the president's speech was a coda to a political career that spoke as much to their own evolution as a community as it did to how the nation has changed over his eight years in office.

The White House had meticulously planned the event, from the location to the tone and cadence of the speech. Mr. Obama was still rewriting the speech on Tuesday afternoon, one of his aides said, after being up late Monday night scrawling edits on what at that point was the fourth draft.

Dozens of alumni from the White House and Mr. Obama's political operation converged on Chicago to witness their former boss's last major turn on the national stage, attending parties and receptions all over town. ""Beers and tears,"" said Ben LaBolt, the former national press secretary for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign.

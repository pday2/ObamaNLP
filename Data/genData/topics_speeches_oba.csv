Unfortunately, faced uncertain threat, government series hasty decisions. believe decisions motivated desire protect American people. believe government decisions based fear foresight; government trimmed evidence fit ideological predispositions. strategically applying power principles, set principles luxuries longer afford. season fear, Democrats Republicans, politicians, journalists, citizens fell silent. words, went course. assessment alone. assessment shared American people nominated candidates major parties who, differences, called new approach rejected torture recognized imperative closing prison Guantanamo Bay. let clear: war Qaeda affiliates. need update institutions deal threat. abiding confidence rule law process; checks balances accountability. reasons explain, decisions years established ad hoc legal approach fighting terrorism effective sustainable framework failed rely legal traditions time-tested institutions, failed values compass. that's took steps taking office protect American people. First, banned so-called enhanced interrogation techniques United States America. know argued brutal methods like waterboarding safe. disagree more. Commander-in-Chief, intelligence. bear responsibility keeping country safe. categorically reject assertion effective means interrogation. What's more, undermine rule law. alienate world. serve recruitment tool terrorists, increase enemies fight us, decreasing work America. risk lives troops making likely surrender battle, likely Americans mistreated captured. short, advance war counterterrorism efforts undermined them, ended all. Now, add, arguments techniques originate administration. Senator McCain said, torture ""serves great propaganda tool recruit people fight us."" Bush, recognition members administration including Secretary State, senior officials, military intelligence community argued tactics wrong debate, wrong history. That's leave methods belong past. are, America. second decision order closing prison camp Guantanamo Bay. years, detained hundreds people Guantanamo. time, military commissions place Guantanamo succeeded convicting grand total suspected terrorists. Let repeat that: convictions years. bringing terrorists justice, efforts prosecution met setback setback, cases lingered on, 2006 Supreme Court invalidated entire system. Meanwhile, 525 detainees released Guantanamo administration, previous administration. Let repeat that: Two-thirds detainees released took office ordered closure Guantanamo. Guantanamo set moral authority America's strongest currency world. building durable framework struggle Qaeda drew deeply held values traditions, government defending positions undermined rule law. fact, rationale establishing Guantanamo place misplaced notion prison law proposition Supreme Court soundly rejected. Meanwhile, serving tool counter terrorism, Guantanamo symbol helped Qaeda recruit terrorists cause. Indeed, existence Guantanamo likely created terrorists world detained. record clear: keeping safer, prison Guantanamo weakened American national security. rallying enemies. sets willingness allies work fighting enemy operates scores countries. measure, costs keeping open far exceed complications involved closing it. That's argued closed campaign, ordered closed year. decision order review pending cases Guantanamo. knew ordered Guantanamo closed difficult complex. 240 people spent years legal limbo. dealing situation, don't luxury starting scratch. We're cleaning is, simply, mess misguided experiment left wake flood legal challenges administration forced deal constant, daily basis, consumes time government officials time spent protecting country. Indeed, legal challenges sparked debate recent weeks Washington taking place decided close Guantanamo. example, court order release 17 Uighurs 17 Uighur detainees took place fall, George Bush President. Supreme Court invalidated prosecution Guantanamo 2006 overwhelmingly appointed Republican Presidents wild-eyed liberals. words, problem Guantanamo detainees caused decision close facility; problem exists decision open Guantanamo place. let blunt. neat easy answers here. wish were. tell wrong answer pretend like problem away maintain unsustainable status quo. President, refuse allow problem fester. refuse pass else. responsibility solve problem. security interests permit delay. courts won't allow it. conscience. Now, weeks, we've seen return politicization issues characterized years. I'm elected official; understand problems arouse passions concerns. should. We're confronting complicated questions democracy face. spending time relitigating policies years. I'll leave others. want solve problems, want solve Americans. ill-served fear-mongering emerges discuss issue. Listening recent debate, I've heard words that, frankly, calculated scare people educate them; words politics protecting country. want opportunity lay doing, intend resolve outstanding issues. explain action taking help build framework protects American people values hold dear. I'll focus broad areas: first, issues relating Guantanamo detention policy; but, second, want discuss issues relating security transparency. Now, let begin disposing argument plainly can: going release endanger national security, release detainees United States endanger American people. demanded justice national security, seek transfer detainees type facilities hold manner dangerous violent criminals borders namely, highly secure prisons ensure public safety. decisions, bear mind following face: escaped federal, supermax prisons, hold hundreds convicted terrorists. Republican Lindsey Graham said, idea place securely house 250-plus detainees United States rational. currently process reviewing detainee cases Guantanamo determine policy dealing them. so, acutely aware administration, detainees released and, cases, returned battlefield. That's away poorly planned, haphazard approach let detainees past. treating cases care attention law requires security demands. Now, going forward, cases fall distinct categories. First, feasible, try violated American criminal laws federal courts courts United States Constitution. derided federal courts incapable handling trials terrorists. wrong. courts juries, citizens, tough convict terrorists. record makes clear. Ramzi Yousef tried blow World Trade Center. convicted courts serving life sentence U.S. prisons. Zacarias Moussaoui identified 20th 9/11 hijacker. convicted courts, serving life sentence prison. try terrorists courts hold prisons, detainees Guantanamo. Recently, prosecuted received guilty plea detainee, al-Marri, federal court years legal confusion. We're preparing transfer detainee Southern District Court New York, face trial charges 1998 bombings embassies Kenya Tanzania bombings killed 200 people. Preventing detainee coming shores prevent trial conviction. decade, time finally justice served, intend do. second category cases involves detainees violate laws war best tried military commissions. Military commissions history United States dating George Washington Revolutionary War. venue trying detainees violations laws war. allow protection sensitive sources methods intelligence-gathering; allow safety security participants; presentation evidence gathered battlefield effectively presented federal courts. Now, suggested represents reversal part. look record. 2006, strongly oppose legislation proposed Bush administration passed Congress failed establish legitimate legal framework, kind meaningful process rights accused stand appeal. time, however, supported military commissions try detainees, reforms, bipartisan efforts achieve reforms. reforms making. using flawed commissions years, administration bringing commissions line rule law. longer permit evidence evidence statements obtained using cruel, inhuman, degrading interrogation methods. longer place burden prove hearsay unreliable opponent hearsay. detainees greater latitude selecting counsel, protections refuse testify. reforms, others, military commissions credible effective means administering justice, work Congress members parties, legal authorities political spectrum, legislation ensure commissions fair, legitimate, effective. category detainees includes ordered released courts. Now, let repeat earlier: decision close Guantanamo. rule law. courts spoken. there's legitimate reason hold 21 people currently held Guantanamo. Nineteen findings took place sworn office. ignore rulings President, bound law. United States nation laws abide rulings. fourth category cases involves detainees determined transferred safely country. far, review team approved 50 detainees transfer. administration ongoing discussions number countries transfer detainees soil detention rehabilitation. Now, finally, remains detainees Guantanamo prosecuted pose clear danger American people. honest toughest single issue face. We're going exhaust avenue prosecute Guantanamo pose danger country. process complete, number people prosecuted past crimes, cases evidence tainted, nonetheless pose threat security United States. Examples threat include people who've received extensive explosives training Qaeda training camps, commanded Taliban troops battle, expressed allegiance Osama bin Laden, clear want kill Americans. people who, effect, remain war United States. Let repeat: going release individuals endanger American people. Qaeda terrorists affiliates war United States, capture like prisoners war prevented attacking again. that, recognize detention policies unbounded. can't based simply executive branch decide alone. That's administration begun reshape standards apply ensure line rule law. clear, defensible, lawful standards fall category. fair procedures don't mistakes. process periodic review, prolonged detention carefully evaluated justified. know creating poses unique challenges. countries grappled question; now, we. want clear goal construct legitimate legal framework remaining Guantanamo detainees transferred. goal avoid legitimate legal framework. constitutional system, prolonged detention decision man. determine United States hold individuals carrying act war, involves judicial congressional oversight. so, going forward, administration work Congress develop legal regime efforts consistent values Constitution. Now, efforts close Guantanamo forward, know politics Congress difficult. issues fodder 30-second commercials. picture direct mail pieces emerge vote issue designed frighten population. it. continue decisions climate fear, mistakes. refuse deal issues today, guarantee albatross efforts combat terrorism future. confidence American people interested right protect country political posturing. person city swore oath uphold Constitution member Congress. responsibility enlist values effort secure people, leave legacy makes easier future Presidents country safe. Now, let touch second set issues security transparency. National security requires delicate balance. hand, democracy depends transparency. hand, protected public disclosure sake security instance, movement troops, intelligence-gathering, terrorist organization affiliates. cases, lives stake. Now, weeks ago, ongoing court case, released memos issued previous administration's Office Legal Counsel. disagreed enhanced interrogation techniques memos authorized, didn't release documents rejected legal rationales counts. released memos existence approach interrogation widely known, Bush administration acknowledged existence, banned methods. argument releasing memos terrorists interrogated makes sense. interrogating terrorists using approach. approach prohibited. short, released memos overriding reason protect them. ensuing debate helped American people understand interrogation methods came authorized used. hand, recently opposed release photographs taken detainees U.S. personnel 2002 2004. Individuals violated standards behavior photos investigated held accountable. debate reflected photos wrong. concealed absolve perpetrators crimes. However, judgment informed national security team releasing photos inflame anti-American opinion allow enemies paint U.S. troops broad, damning, inaccurate brush, endangering theaters war. short, clear compelling reason release photos. nearly 200,000 Americans serving harm's way, solemn responsibility safety Commander-in-Chief. gained release photos matters lives young men women serving harm's way. Now, press's mind public's mind, cases contradictory. me. cases, strike right balance transparency national security. balance brings precious responsibility. There's doubt American people seen balance tested years. images Abu Ghraib brutal interrogation techniques public long President, American people learned actions taken bear resemblance ideals generations Americans fought for. run-up Iraq war revelation secret programs, Americans felt like story unnecessarily withheld them. caused suspicion build up. leads thirst accountability. understand that. ran promising transparency, meant said. that's why, possible, administration American people informed judgments hold accountable. argued sensitive national security matters simply open book. abandon vigorously defend necessity classification defend troops war, protect sources methods, safeguard confidential actions American people safe. Here's difference though: release public valid national security reasons, insist oversight actions Congress courts. We're currently launching review current policies agencies responsible classification documents determine reforms possible, assure branches government position review executive branch decisions matters. checks balances, watch watchers especially comes sensitive administration information. Now, lines, administration confronting challenges known ""state secrets"" privilege. doctrine allows government challenge legal cases involving secret programs. It's past Presidents Republican Democrat decades. principle absolutely circumstances protect national security, concerned over-used. currently subject wide range lawsuits. let lay principles here. protect merely reveals violation law embarrassment government. that's administration nearing completion review practice. plan embrace principles reform. apply stricter legal test material protected state secrets privilege. assert privilege court following formal process, including review Justice Department committee personal approval Attorney General. year voluntarily report Congress invoked privilege because, before, proper oversight actions. matters disclosure sensitive information, wish say simple formula had. not. involve tough calls, involve competing concerns, require surgical approach. common thread runs decisions simple: safeguard protect American people, ensure accountability oversight hallmark constitutional system. hide truth it's uncomfortable. deal Congress courts co-equal branches government. tell American people know don't know, release publicly secret, tell why. Now, areas I've discussed today, policies I've proposed represent new direction years. protect American people values, we've banned enhanced interrogation techniques. closing prison Guantanamo. reforming military commissions, pursue new legal regime detain terrorists. declassifying embracing oversight actions, we're narrowing state secrets privilege. dramatic changes approach national security surer, safer, sustainable footing. implementation time, done. There's core principle apply actions. clean mess Guantanamo, constantly reevaluate approach, subject decisions review branches government, public. seek strongest sustainable legal framework addressing issues long term serve politics, what's right long term. leave legacy outlasts administration, presidency, endures legacy protects American people enjoys broad legitimacy home abroad. Now, mean say need focus future. recognize strong desire focus past. comes actions years, passions high. Americans angry; want re-fight debates settled, cases debates lost. know debates lead directly, cases, fuller accounting, independent commission. I've opposed creation commission believe existing democratic institutions strong deliver accountability. Congress review abuses values, ongoing inquiries Congress matters like enhanced interrogation techniques. Department Justice courts work punish violations laws miscarriages justice. It's secret tendency Washington spend time pointing fingers another. it's secret media culture feeds impulse lead fight copy. contribute extended relitigation years. Already, we've seen kind effort leads Washington sides laying blame. distract focusing time, efforts, politics challenges future. that, all, recent debate recent debate obscured truth sends people opposite absolutist ends. spectrum, little allowance unique challenges posed terrorism, national security transparency. end spectrum, embrace view summarized words: ""Anything goes."" arguments suggest ends fighting terrorism justify means, blanket authority wants agree. sides views, right. American people absolutist, don't elect impose rigid ideology problems. know need sacrifice security values, sacrifice values security, long approach difficult questions honesty care dose common sense. That, all, unique genius America. That's challenge laid Constitution. source strength ages. That's makes United States America nation. stand today, United States, say exception equivocation torture, vigorously protect people forging strong durable framework allows fight terrorism abiding rule law. mistake: fail turn page approach taken past years, able say President. stand core values, keeping faith documents enshrined hall.

Thursday, spent hours summit Democrats Republicans engaged public substantive discussion health care. meeting capped debate began similar summit nearly year ago. then, idea table. argument made. say health care it. time decision finally reform health care works, insurance companies, America’s families America’s businesses. Now, sides say agree status quo working American people. Health insurance expensive day. Families can’t afford it. Businesses can’t afford it. federal government can’t afford it. Smaller businesses individuals don’t coverage work squeezed especially hard. insurance companies freely ration health care based who’s sick who’s healthy; pay can’t. That's status quo. That's right now. Democrats Republicans agree problem America. agree throw hands walk away it’s problem grow worse. disputes that. Americans lose family's health insurance switch jobs lose job. small businesses forced choose health care hiring. insurance companies deny people coverage preexisting conditions, they'll drop people's coverage sick need most. rising cost Medicare Medicaid sink government deeper deeper deeper debt. agree. is, it? end spectrum, who've suggested scrapping private insurance replacing government-run health care system. countries system, America practical realistic. end spectrum, those, includes Republicans Congress, believe answer loosen regulations insurance industry it's state consumer protections minimum standards kind insurance sell. argument is, lower costs. disagree approach. I'm concerned insurance industry freer rein raise premiums deny care. don't believe government bureaucrats insurance company bureaucrats control health care America. believe it's time American people control health care health insurance. don't believe afford leave life-and-death decisions health care discretion insurance company executives alone. believe doctors nurses physician assistants like ones room free decide what's best patients. Now, proposal forward gives Americans control health insurance health care holding insurance companies accountable. builds current Americans health insurance employer. like plan, plan. like doctor, doctor. tell father young girls, want plan interferes relationship family doctor. Essentially, proposal change current health care system. First, end worst practices insurance companies. longer able deny coverage preexisting condition. longer able drop coverage sick. longer able force pay unlimited amounts money pocket. longer able arbitrarily massively raise premiums like Anthem Blue Cross recently tried California 39 percent increases year individual market. practices end. Second, proposal uninsured individuals small business owners kind choice private health insurance members Congress it’s members Congress, it’s people pay salaries. reason federal employees deal health insurance participate insurance market insurance companies coverage rates, customers. It's idea Republicans embraced past, politics intruded. proposal says can’t afford insurance new marketplace, it's going deals people right individual marketplace, we'll offer tax credits tax credits add largest middle-class tax cut health care history. all, wealthiest buy best insurance is, able coverage Medicaid. it's middle class squeezed, that’s help. Now, absolutely true cost money $100 billion year. comes nearly $2 trillion year America spends health care spent wisely. money wasted spent badly. plan, we’re going sure dollars spend making insurance affordable secure. We’re going eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies currently insurance pharmaceutical companies; set new fee insurance companies stand gain money profits millions Americans able buy insurance; we're going sure wealthiest Americans pay fair share Medicare. line proposal paid for. new money generated plan goes small businesses middle-class families can't afford health insurance. lower prescription drug prices seniors. help train new doctors nurses physician assistants care American families. Finally, proposal bring cost health care millions families, businesses, federal government. incorporated ideas political spectrum contain rising cost health care ideas waste abuse system, especially programs like Medicare. protecting Medicare benefits, extending financial stability program nearly decade. cost-cutting measures mirror proposals current Senate bill, reduces people's premiums brings deficit trillion dollars decades brings deficit. aren't numbers; savings determined Congressional Budget Office, Washington acronym nonpartisan, independent referee Congress terms stuff costs. that's proposal. we've ended up. It's approach debated changed believe improved year. incorporates best ideas Democrats Republicans including ideas Republicans offered health care summit, like funding state grants medical malpractice reform, curbing waste fraud abuse health care system. proposal rid provisions place health care reform provisions winning individual votes Congress improving health care Americans. Now, agree Republican ideas we've incorporated, Republicans Congress fundamental disagreement oversight insurance companies. truly believe regulation lead higher quality, affordable health insurance, vote proposal I've forward. Now, believe should, I'm proposing, pursue piecemeal approach health insurance reform, tinker edges challenge years. acknowledge problem uninsured say can't afford help right Republican proposal covers 3 million uninsured Americans cover 31 million. problem approach access affordable coverage, can't prevent insurance companies denying coverage based preexisting conditions; can't limit families forced pay pockets. insurance reforms rest access coverage. don't taxpayers currently end subsidizing uninsured they're forced emergency room care, tune thousand bucks family. can't savings people going emergency room. is, health reform works care problems once. Now, week's summit, Republicans Congress insisted acceptable course health care reform start over. given honest substantial differences parties need regulate insurance industry need help millions middle-class families insurance, don't year negotiations help. Moreover, insurance companies aren't starting over. They're continuing raise premiums deny coverage speak. start simply lead delay decade, more. American people, U.S. economy, can't wait long.

That’s middle-class economics, but, know what, trade. strive sure economy lives high standards, parts world, rules unfair. playing field uneven. puts American businesses American workers disadvantage. is, it? folks think withdraw try engage trade countries. disagree. sure America writes rules global economy. today, economy position global strength. don’t write rules trade world guess China will. they’ll write rules way gives Chinese workers Chinese businesses upper hand, locks American-made goods out. That’s choice face. We're going able isolate world markets. compete. is, going sure rules fair businesses workers level playing field. are, win time. rules fair, win time. I’m strong supporter new trade agreements. They're going help workers compete businesses compete. left issue right issue, business labor issue. fairness equity access. like issues we’ve waged slow, steady fights years, past future. Trans-Pacific Partnership we’re working on, it’s biggest trade deal we're working right Asia Pacific region. reflects values ways that, frankly, previous trade agreements not. It’s highest-standard, progressive trade deal history. It’s strong, enforceable provisions workers, preventing like child labor. It’s strong, enforceable provisions environment, helping haven’t before, prevent wildlife trafficking, deforestation, dealing oceans. enforceable agreement.

Portland right away. moves right direction. Vietnam, countries trade agreement don’t meet requirements, they’ll face meaningful consequences. you’re country wants agreement, meet higher standards. don’t, you’re out. break rules, actual repercussions. that’s American businesses American workers, meet higher standards rest world, helps level playing field. deal strengthen hand overseas giving tools open markets goods services sure play fair rules help write. truth is, open markets world.

It’s stuff. that’s best happen businesses workers opening markets previously closed, markets they’re selling stuff here. There’s lack reciprocity. It’s fair deal right now. want fair. Now, want acknowledge looks like well-read informed crowd bunch critics trade deals generally Trans-Pacific Partnership. what’s interesting typically they’re friends, coming party, they’re fellow travelers minimum wage job training clean energy. progressive issue, they’re right me. one, they’re like whooping me. tell what. I’ve run election, reason think it’s American workers American people American economy. don’t rationale think it’s best American people. issue, trade, actually think dearest friends wrong. They’re wrong. here’s why. all, say trade agreement cost American jobs. they’re basing past experience, looking happened ‘90s, 20 years, outsourcing going on. know what, past trade agreements, it’s true, didn’t reflect values didn’t protect American workers. that’s we’re designing kind trade deal. truth companies care low wages, they’ve moved. don’t need new trade deals move. They’ve outsourced. They’ve located search low wages. trade agreement open doors higher-skill, higher-wage jobs future jobs excel at. sure manufacturers operating higher end value chain able access growing markets. is, past years, manufacturers steadily creating jobs time 1990s Administration. decade away spot, business leaders world declared United States world’s number place invest year row. year row. point is, outsourcing giving way insourcing. Companies starting advanced manufacturing, trend expect continue. trade deal help that. morning, Mark mentioned, Nike announced that, Trans-Pacific Partnership, new investments advanced manufacturing overseas, right United States. far Nike products U.S.A. means thousands new jobs manufacturing engineering design Nike facilities country, potentially tens thousands new jobs Nike’s supply chain home. That’s trade do. Look, I’ve spent half years trying rescue economy half years trying revitalize American manufacturing, including rescuing American auto industry fully recovered. risk thought trade deals going undermine it. reason I’m think enhance advance it. that’s point number one. Point number ask folks specifically, oppose trade deal, say “NAFTA.” NAFTA passed 20 years ago. agreement. fact, agreement fixes wrong NAFTA making labor environmental provisions actually enforceable. law school NAFTA passed. Number you’ve critics saying deal rushed through; it’s secret deal, people don’t know what’s it. true. agreement finalize 11 countries posted online 60 days sign it. Congress know they’re going fast. months review. crossed, dotted. going able exactly what’s it. There’s fast-track this. deliberate track fully subject scrutiny. I’m confident people read agreement themselves, they’ll progressive trade deal history. Number critics warn parts deal undermine American regulation food safety, worker safety, financial regulations. They’re making stuff up. true. trade agreement going force change laws. agreement sure companies aren’t discriminated countries. treat companies countries fairly here. companies don’t treated fairly there. need way settle disputes it’s subject whims government bureaucrat country. That’s important. want businesses succeed selling that's workers jobs United States. finally, critics talk currency manipulation. Now, problem past. countries, try lower currency makes goods cheaper, makes expensive. time China pretty egregious this. came office, started pounding them. time meet them, I’d talking currency. pushed hard, China moved. real terms, currency appreciated 30 percent came office. we're going going it. that’s argument trade agreement. chance help businesses sell stuff world’s fastest-growing markets, doesn't currency manipulation. is, folks opposed trade deals principle, reflexive principle. tell is, know what, you're opposed smart, progressive trade deals, means satisfied status quo. status quo hasn’t working workers. hasn’t working businesses. people tell why. I’m going couple examples small businesses chance meet today. Egg Press Portland-based greeting card company. nice. sell cards Australia, member Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. CEO, Tess Darrow where’s Tess? Raise hand. saw her. is. Tess says easily reach customers Japan, well, they’d sell half volume America. That’s lot. Right now, logistics exporting Japan complicated.

I’m teasing. trade deal help eliminate barriers, simplify customs, hold countries accountable products delivered swiftly. Tess sells, grow, hire Oregon, United States. Oregon Fruit Products makes canned fruits, berries, products depends exports 20 percent annual sales. Right now, exports members partnership we're putting together: Japan, Australia, Singapore, Canada.

Right now, high tariffs American wine country. trade partnership, tariffs eliminated, wineries America sales grow overseas. brother --and-sister team runs vineyard wave, guys say, “If easier business countries trading partners, countries allies, that’s thing.” They’re right. deal thing. let’s “just it.” took catch that, didn’t it? thought pretty obvious. So, listen, know folks skeptical trade. Past trade deals didn’t live hype. Labor environmental protections weren’t strong enough. saw years, Chicago towns Illinois, manufacturing collapsing, jobs drying up. Outsourcing real. Folks didn’t up. manufacturing base shifted 25 years, wasn’t manufacturing wasn’t communities, wasn’t workers. That’s truth. benefits jobs created, cheaper goods. real displacement real pain. so, Americans, abstraction; real. we’ve learn right lessons that. lesson pull drawbridge build moat ourselves. lesson is, we’ve sure trade deals shape ones allow compete fairly. took office, decided rethink way trade way actually works working Americans. didn’t think right companies. didn’t think right working families, fighting it. agreement undercuts working families, won’t sign it. ran office expand opportunity all-American idea matter are, come from, started out, love, America try.

That's I've asked Dr. Jill Biden happens relation Vice President, Joe Biden, community college educator 16 years promote community colleges help community colleges stronger. that's we're putting place American Graduation Initiative. Let specifics we're going do. Number one, offer competitive grants, challenging community colleges pursue innovative, results-oriented strategies exchange federal funding. We'll fund programs connect students looking jobs businesses looking hire. We'll challenge schools new ways help students catch basics, like math science, essential competitiveness. We'll colleges employers create programs match curricula classroom needs boardroom. kinds kinds examples what's possible. We've seen Cisco, example, working community colleges prepare students workers jobs ranging work broadband health IT. know successful community colleges partner private sector. want encourage companies work schools build type relationships. way, goes training program, know there's job end training. We'll create new research center simple mission: measure works doesn't. often, don't know happens walks classroom factory floor library laboratory office. means businesses can't sure degree worth. schools don't informed choices programs receive achieve results programs don't. important, businesses colleges, students workers, well. parent going spend time classroom away family especially long day work degree mean something. know degree, going help advance goals. worker going spend years training enter new profession, certificate mean ready, businesses ready hire. addition, want propose new funding innovative strategies promote enrollment community college program, completion program. See, half half students enter community college earn associate degree, transfer four-year school earn bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail reach goal. That's waste valuable resource, that's tragedy students. Oftentimes they've taken debt don't degree, pay debt. it's disaster economy. we'll fund programs track student progress inside classroom. Let's figure what's keeping students crossing finish line, place reforms remove barriers. Maybe difficult parent away home, expensive waiter nurse miss shift. Maybe young student isn't sure education lead employment. point is, need figure solutions kinds challenges facing impediments shouldn't prevent reaching potential. right, that's big chunk initiative. second part: We're going $10 billion loans renovate rebuild college classrooms buildings country. often, community colleges treated like stepchild higher education system; they're afterthought, they're thought all. means schools years facilities provide, means, 21st century economy, they're years education offer. That's mistake it's we'll help correct. fund, schools chance borrow affordable rate modernize facilities, they'll building funds recovery plan helping renovate schools, including community colleges country. way, improve schools training they're providing, guess what? hire workers tradesmen women work schools. means it's putting people work Michigan right right now.

That's judgment Commander-in-Chief.

It’s wonder, then, you're asking hard questions. let answer important questions I've heard members Congress, I've read letters you've me. First, asked, won’t slippery slope war? man wrote “still recovering involvement Iraq.” veteran bluntly: “This nation sick tired war.” answer simple: American boots ground Syria. pursue open-ended action like Iraq Afghanistan. pursue prolonged air campaign like Libya Kosovo. targeted strike achieve clear objective: deterring chemical weapons, degrading Assad’s capabilities. asked it's worth acting don’t Assad. members Congress said, there’s point simply “pinprick” strike Syria. Let clear: United States military doesn’t pinpricks. limited strike message Assad nation deliver. don't think remove dictator force learned Iraq makes responsible comes next. targeted strike Assad, dictator, think twice using chemical weapons. questions involve dangers retaliation. don’t dismiss threats, Assad regime ability seriously threaten military. retaliation seek line threats face day. Assad allies escalation lead demise. ally, Israel, defend overwhelming force, unshakeable support United States America. asked broader question: involved place that's complicated, person wrote “those come Assad enemies human rights?” It’s true Assad’s opponents extremists. Qaeda draw strength chaotic Syria people world prevent innocent civilians gassed death. majority Syrian people Syrian opposition work want live peace, dignity freedom. day military action, redouble efforts achieve political solution strengthens reject forces tyranny extremism. Finally, asked: leave countries, seek solutions short force? people wrote me, “We world’s policeman.” agree, deeply held preference peaceful solutions. years, administration tried diplomacy sanctions, warning negotiations chemical weapons Assad regime. However, days, we’ve seen encouraging signs. credible threat U.S. military action, constructive talks Putin, Russian government willingness join international community pushing Assad chemical weapons. Assad regime admitted weapons, they’d join Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibits use. It’s early tell offer succeed, agreement verify Assad regime keeps commitments. initiative potential remove threat chemical weapons force, Russia Assad’s strongest allies. have, therefore, asked leaders Congress postpone vote authorize force pursue diplomatic path. I’m sending Secretary State John Kerry meet Russian counterpart Thursday, continue discussions Putin. I’ve spoken leaders closest allies, France United Kingdom, work consultation Russia China forward resolution U.N. Security Council requiring Assad chemical weapons, ultimately destroy international control. We’ll U.N. inspectors opportunity report findings happened August 21st. continue rally support allies Europe Americas Asia Middle East agree need action. Meanwhile, I’ve ordered military maintain current posture pressure Assad, position respond diplomacy fails. tonight, military families incredible strength sacrifices. fellow Americans, nearly decades, United States anchor global security. meant forging international agreements meant enforcing them. burdens leadership heavy, world place borne them. so, friends right, ask reconcile commitment America’s military failure act cause plainly just. friends left, ask reconcile belief freedom dignity people images children writhing pain, going cold hospital floor. resolutions statements condemnation simply enough. Indeed, I’d ask member Congress, watching home tonight, view videos attack, ask: kind world live United States America sees dictator brazenly violate international law poison gas, choose look way? Franklin Roosevelt said, “Our national determination free foreign wars foreign entanglements prevent feeling deep concern ideals principles cherished challenged.” ideals principles, national security, stake Syria, leadership world seek ensure worst weapons used.

We're creating new rewards tie teachers' performance new pathways advancement. I've asked American commit year higher education career training, tax credits college education affordable American, attend Georgetown. And, way, changes like I'm going talking weeks come seeing best brightest commit making engineers, scientists, innovators. long, placed pinnacle folks manipulate numbers engage complex financial calculations. that's good, need that. know scientists engineers, building making export countries. Now, pillar new foundation harness renewable energy create millions new jobs new industries. know country harnesses new energy source lead 21st century. we've allowed countries outpace race future. don't know you, accept future jobs industries tomorrow root borders. think it's time America lead again. investments Recovery Act double nation's supply renewable energy years. putting Americans work making homes buildings efficient save billions energy bills grow economy time.

Altogether, budget reduce discretionary spending domestic programs share economy 10 percent decade lowest level we've seen began keeping records nearly half century ago. continue federal budget line line, announcing additional savings, secured eliminating consolidating programs don't need room need. That's we're now. course, realize some, isn't enough. know there's criticism administration spending reckless abandon, pushing liberal social agenda mortgaging children's future. You've heard argument. Well, let points. First, earlier, worst recession severe try cut government spending time families businesses world cutting spending. deficit debt problems major efforts deal focus medium long-term budget picture, short-term. that's exactly we've done. Second, tackling deficit issue, simply sacrifice long-term investments desperately need generate long-term prosperity. That's argument critics made: Well, you're proposing health care reform, shouldn't that; you're proposing education investments, shouldn't that, adds deficit. Look, cash-strapped family cut kinds luxuries, insist spending money children college, refuse kids drop college work fast-food place, bring income short-term, they're thinking long term country current choices eye future. don't invest renewable energy, don't invest skilled workforce, don't invest affordable health care system, economy simply won't grow pace needs 10 years road. don't lay new foundation now, won't long we're right today. assure chronically slow growth help long-term budget situation. That's second point. point, problem deficit debt new. building dramatically past years, largely big tax cuts combined increased spending wars increased costs government health care programs pushed upwards. structural gap budget, money that's coming money that's going out, worse baby boomers age, lead unsustainable path. let's kid suggest solve problem trimming earmarks cutting budget National Endowment Arts.

Now, important goal passing health care reform brings costs system, including Medicare Medicaid. mistake, health care reform entitlement reform. That's opinion conclusion wide range participants Fiscal Responsibility Summit held White House February. that's reasons firmly believe need health care reform year. tackle rising health care costs, work Social Security firmer footing. It's time parties come way promise sound retirement future generations. restore sense fairness balance tax code including shutting corporate loopholes ensuring pays owe. efforts require tough choices. efforts require compromise. difficulties can't serve excuse inaction anymore brings final point I'd like today.

Thursday, TV networks covering Joe’s meetings topic, news broke school shooting, California. month 20 precious children brave adults violently taken Sandy Hook Elementary, 900 fellow Americans reportedly died end gun 900 past month. day wait, number growing. I’m putting forward specific set proposals based work Joe’s task force. days ahead, intend weight office holds reality. law set laws prevent senseless act violence completely, piece legislation prevent tragedy, act evil, reduce violence, life saved, we've obligation try. I’m going part. soon I'm finished speaking here, sit desk sign directive giving law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals public health community tools need help reduce gun violence. easier guns hands criminals strengthening background check system. help schools hire resource officers want develop emergency preparedness plans. sure mental health professionals know options reporting threats violence acknowledge mental illness far likely victim violent crime perpetrator. year year, oppose modest gun safety measures threatened defund scientific medical research causes gun violence, direct Centers Disease Control ahead study best ways reduce Congress fund research effects violent video games young minds. don't benefit ignorance. don't benefit knowing science epidemic violence. 23 executive actions I’m announcing today. important steps are, way substitute action members Congress. real lasting difference, Congress, too, act Congress act soon. I’m calling Congress pass specific proposals right away. First: It’s time Congress require universal background check trying buy gun. law requires licensed gun dealers run background checks, 14 years that’s kept 1.5 million wrong people hands gun. it’s hard enforce law 40 percent gun purchases conducted background check. That’s safe. That's smart. It’s fair responsible gun buyers sellers. want buy gun it’s licensed dealer private seller felon legally prohibited buying one. common sense. overwhelming majority Americans agree need universal background checks including 70 percent National Rifle Association’s members, according survey. there’s reason can’t this. Second: Congress restore ban military-style assault weapons, 10-round limit magazines. type assault rifle Aurora, example, paired high-capacity magazines, purpose pump bullets possible, quickly possible; damage, using bullets designed inflict maximum damage. that's allowed gunman Aurora shoot 70 people 70 people killing 12 matter minutes. Weapons designed theater war place movie theater. majority Americans agree this. And, way, Ronald Reagan, staunchest defenders Second Amendment, wrote Congress 1994, urging Ronald Reagan speaking urging “listen American public law enforcement community support ban manufacture weapons.” finally, Congress needs help, hinder, law enforcement job. tougher people buy guns express purpose turning selling criminals. severely punish helps this. Congress hasn’t confirmed director Bureau Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms years, confirm Todd Jones, Acting, nominating post. time budget cuts forcing communities reduce police force, cops job streets. Let absolutely clear. Like Americans, believe Second Amendment guarantees individual right bear arms. respect strong tradition gun ownership rights hunters sportsmen. millions responsible, law-abiding gun owners America cherish right bear arms hunting, sport, protection, collection. believe gun owners agree respect Second Amendment keeping irresponsible, law-breaking inflicting harm massive scale. believe agree America worked harder guns hands dangerous people, atrocities like occurred Newtown. That’s reforms designed do. They’re common-sense measures. support majority American people. yet, doesn’t mean going easy enact implement. were, we’d universal background checks. ban assault weapons high-capacity magazines allowed expire. fellow Americans alive, celebrating birthdays anniversaries graduations. difficult. pundits politicians special lobbyists publicly warning tyrannical, all-out assault liberty that’s true, want gin fear higher ratings revenue themselves. scenes, they’ll block common-sense reform sure changes whatsoever. way able change audience, constituents, membership says time time, protect communities kids.

That's it's going take. letter Julia wrote me, said, “I know laws passed Congress, beg try hard.” Julia, try hard. she’s right. important changes depend congressional action. need bring proposals vote, American people need sure do. record.

We’re longer competing achieve singular goal like reaching Moon. fact, global competition long global collaboration. measure achievements changed great deal past 50 years, fail seeking new frontiers consequential future space Earth. let start extremely clear: 100 percent committed mission NASA future. broadening capabilities space continue serve society ways scarcely imagine. exploration inspire wonder new generation sparking passions launching careers. because, ultimately, fail press forward pursuit discovery, ceding future ceding essential element American character. know number questions raised administration’s plan space exploration, especially Florida rely NASA source income source pride community. questions come time transition, space shuttle nears scheduled retirement 30 years service. understandably, adds worries folks concerned futures future space program they’ve devoted lives. know underlying concerns deeper worry, precedes plan administration. stems sense people Washington driven vision politics years neglected NASA’s mission undermined work professionals fulfill it. We’ve seen NASA budget, risen fallen political winds. ways: reluctance hold office set clear, achievable objectives; resources meet objectives; justify plans larger purpose space exploration 21st century. change. strategy I’m outlining today, will. start increasing NASA’s budget $6 billion years, want people understand context this. happening instituted freeze discretionary spending sought cuts budget. NASA, start, months ago issued budget, areas didn’t maintain freeze actually increased funding $6 billion. ramp robotic exploration solar system, including probe Sun’s atmosphere; new scouting missions Mars destinations; advanced telescope follow Hubble, allowing peer deeper universe before. increase Earth-based observation improve understanding climate world science garner tangible benefits, helping protect environment future generations. extend life International Space Station likely years, actually using intended purpose: conducting advanced research help improve daily lives people Earth, testing improving capabilities space. includes technologies like efficient life support systems help reduce cost future missions. order reach space station, work growing array private companies competing space easier affordable. Now, recognize unfeasible unwise work private sector way. disagree. truth is, NASA relied private industry help design build vehicles carry astronauts space, Mercury capsule carried John Glenn orbit nearly 50 years ago, space shuttle Discovery currently orbiting overhead. buying services space transportation vehicles continue ensure rigorous safety standards met. accelerate pace innovations companies young startups established leaders compete design build launch new means carrying people materials atmosphere. addition, effort, build work Orion crew capsule. I’ve directed Charlie Bolden begin developing rescue vehicle using technology, forced rely foreign providers quickly bring people home International Space Station. Orion effort technological foundation advanced spacecraft future deep space missions. fact, Orion readied flight right room. Next, invest $3 billion conduct research advanced “heavy lift rocket” vehicle efficiently orbit crew capsules, propulsion systems, large quantities supplies needed reach deep space. developing new vehicle, look revising modifying older models; want look new designs, new materials, new technologies transform there. finalize rocket design later 2015 begin build it. want understand: That’s years earlier previously planned that’s conservative, given previous program schedule budget. time, decades neglect, increase investment right away groundbreaking technologies allow astronauts reach space sooner often, travel farther faster cost, live work space longer periods time safely. means tackling major scientific technological challenges. shield astronauts radiation longer missions? harness resources distant worlds? supply spacecraft energy needed far-reaching journeys? questions answer answer. questions answers doubt reap untold benefits right Earth. point we’re looking continue path want leap future; want major breakthroughs; transformative agenda NASA. Now, yes, pursuing new strategy require revise old strategy. part, old strategy including Constellation program fulfilling promise ways. That’s assessment; that’s assessment panel respected non-partisan experts charged looking issues closely. Now, this, harsh words decisions we’ve made, including individuals I’ve enormous respect admiration for. hope is, look planning, consider details we’ve laid out, merits I’ve them. line committed manned space flight, human exploration space am. we’ve smart way, can’t old we’ve thinking going want go. said, instance, plan gives leadership space produce plans NASA reach low Earth orbit, relying companies countries. actually reach space faster new plan, ways help improve technological capacity lower costs, essential long-term sustainability space flight. fact, plan, we’ll sending astronauts space decade. criticized decision end parts Constellation hinder space exploration low Earth orbit. it’s precisely investing groundbreaking research innovative companies potential rapidly transform capabilities build important work completed, projects like Orion, future missions. previous program, setting course specific achievable milestones. Early decade, set crewed flights test prove systems required exploration low Earth orbit. 2025, expect new spacecraft designed long journeys allow begin first-ever crewed missions Moon deep space. we’ll start we’ll start sending astronauts asteroid time history. mid-2030s, believe humans orbit Mars return safely Earth. landing Mars follow. expect it. want repeat want repeat this: Critical deep space exploration development breakthrough propulsion systems advanced technologies. I’m challenging NASA break barriers. we’ll resources break barriers. know will, ingenuity intensity, that’s you’ve done. Now, understand believe attempt return surface Moon first, previously planned. say pretty bluntly here: We’ve before. Buzz there. There’s space explore, learn do. believe it’s important ramp capabilities reach operate series increasingly demanding targets, advancing technological capabilities step forward. that’s strategy does. that’s ensure leadership space stronger new century last. Finally, want say words jobs. Suzanne pointed time here, clear promise help transition new program sure people going tough time region helped. reports contrary, plan add 2,500 jobs Space Coast years compared plan previous administration. want point. We’re going modernize Kennedy Space Center, creating jobs upgrade launch facilities. there’s potential jobs companies Florida America compete new space transportation industry. industry leaders today. holds promise generating 10,000 jobs nationwide years. jobs created right Florida area primed lead competition. Now, it’s true Floridians work shuttle end program winds down. based decision years ago, months ago, doesn’t painful families communities affected decision reality. I’m proposing strong lobbying Suzanne, Charlie I’m proposing $40 million initiative led high-level team White House, NASA, agencies develop plan regional economic growth job creation. expect plan reach desk August 15th. It’s effort help prepare skilled workforce new opportunities space industry beyond. chapter write NASA. partner industry. invest cutting-edge research technology. set far-reaching milestones resources reach milestones. step step, push boundaries do. years creation NASA, goal longer destination reach. goal capacity people work learn operate live safely Earth extended periods time, ultimately ways sustainable indefinite. fulfilling task, extend humanity’s reach space strengthen America’s leadership Earth. Now, I’ll close saying this. know Americans asked that’s apt Tax Day: spend money NASA all? spend money solving problems space don’t lack problems solve ground? obviously country reeling worst economic turmoil we’ve known generations. massive structural deficits closed coming years. know false choice. fix economy. need close deficits. pennies dollar, space program fueled jobs entire industries. pennies dollar, space program improved lives, advanced society, strengthened economy, inspired generations Americans. doubt NASA continue fulfill role. want say clearly work NASA, entire community supportive space program area: exactly it’s essential pursue new course revitalize NASA mission dollars, clear aims larger purpose. Now, little 40 years ago, astronauts descended nine-rung ladder lunar module called Eagle, allowed feet touch dusty surface Earth’s Moon. culmination daring perilous gambit endeavor pushed boundaries knowledge, technological prowess, capacity human beings solve problems. wasn’t greatest achievement NASA’s history greatest achievements human history. beginning end something. choose believe beginning. you.

First, fair shot opportunity security new economy? Second, technology work us, especially comes solving urgent challenges like climate change? Third, America safe lead world policeman? finally, politics reflect what’s best us, what’s worst? Let start economy basic fact: United States America, right now, strongest, durable economy world. We’re middle longest streak private-sector job creation history 14 million new jobs, strongest years job growth 1990s, unemployment rate cut half. auto industry best year ever. That’s manufacturing surge that’s created nearly 900,000 new jobs past years. we’ve cutting deficits three-quarters. claiming America’s economy decline peddling fiction. true, reason Americans feel anxious, economy changing profound ways changes started long Great Recession hit, changes let up. Today, technology doesn’t replace jobs assembly line, job work automated. Companies global economy locate face tougher competition. result, workers leverage raise. Companies loyalty communities. wealth income concentrated top. trends squeezed workers jobs, economy growing. It’s harder hardworking family pull poverty, harder young people start careers, tougher workers retire want to. trends unique America, offend uniquely American belief works hard fair shot. past years, goal growing economy works everybody. We’ve progress, need more. political arguments we’ve past years, actually areas Americans broadly agree. agree real opportunity requires American education training need land good-paying job. bipartisan reform Child Left important start. we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates new highs, boosted graduates fields like engineering. coming years, build progress, Pre-K offering student offering student hands-on computer science math classes job-ready day one. recruit support great teachers kids. college affordable American. hardworking student stuck red. We’ve reduced student loan payments 10 percent borrower’s income, that’s good. we’ve actually cut cost college. years community college cost responsible student best ways that, I’m going fighting started year. It’s right do. great education isn’t need new economy. need benefits protections basic measure security. It’s stretch say people America going work job place health retirement package 30 years sitting chamber. else, especially folks 40s 50s, saving retirement bouncing job loss tougher. Americans understand point careers, new economy, retool; retrain; shouldn’t loose they’ve worked hard build process. That’s Social Security Medicare important ever. shouldn’t weaken them, strengthen them. Americans short retirement, basic benefits mobile today. That, way, Affordable Care Act about. It’s filling gaps employer-based care lose job, school, strike launch new business you’ll coverage. Nearly 18 million people gained coverage far, process process health care inflation slowed, businesses created jobs single month law. Now, I’m guessing won’t agree health care anytime soon. (a little applause right there; guess) ways parties work improve economic security. Say hardworking American loses job, shouldn’t sure unemployment insurance. sure program encourages retrain business that’s ready hire him. new job doesn’t pay much, wage insurance place pay bills. he’s going job job, able save retirement savings him. That’s way new economy work everybody. know Speaker Ryan talked tackling poverty. America giving willing work chance, hand up, I’d welcome discussion strategies support like expanding tax cuts low-income workers don’t children. areas honest: difficult agreement years, fall category role government play making sure system’s rigged favor wealthiest biggest corporations. it’s honest disagreement. American people choice make. believe thriving private sector lifeblood economy. think outdated regulations need changed. red tape needs cut. (There go. Yeah.

2013-10-02,./speeches/2013-10-02-GovernmentShutdown.txt,"morning, everybody. midnight night, time 17 years, Republicans Congress chose shut federal government. Let specific: faction, party, house Congress, branch government, shut major parts government didn’t like law. Republican shutdown happen. want American understand happen. Republicans House Representatives refused fund government defunded dismantled Affordable Care Act. They’ve shut government ideological crusade deny affordable health insurance millions Americans. words, demanded ransom job. representatives, including increasing number Republicans, clear allowed Speaker Boehner simple vote keeping government open, partisan strings attached, votes parties kept American people’s government open operating. know impact Republican shutdown time. depend long lasts. know couple things. know time Republicans shut government 1996, hurt economy. 1996, economy recovering worst recession generations. know services benefits America’s seniors veterans business owners depend hold. offices, national park monument, closed. night, signed legislation sure 1.4 million active-duty military paid shutdown, hundreds thousands civilian workers job, forced stay home aren’t paid, families support local businesses rely them. know longer shutdown continues, worse effects be. families hurt. businesses harmed. So, again, urge House Republicans reopen government, restart services Americans depend on, allow public servants home return work. going happen Republicans realize don’t hold entire economy hostage ideological demands. I’ve repeatedly, prepared work Democrats Republicans need grow economy create jobs, fiscal house order long run. add shutdown isn’t deficits, spending, budgets. all, deficits falling fastest pace 50 years. We’ve cut half took office. fact, demands Republicans making actually raise deficits. No, shutdown deficits, it’s budgets. shutdown rolling efforts health insurance folks don’t it. It’s rolling Affordable Care Act. This, else, Republican Party stands days. know it’s strange party keeping people uninsured centerpiece agenda, apparently is. course, what’s stranger shutting government doesn’t accomplish stated goal. Affordable Care Act law passed House; passed Senate. Supreme Court ruled constitutional. central issue year’s election. settled, stay. funding sources, it’s impacted government shutdown. Americans today because, government closed, big Affordable Care Act open business. them, millions like them, historic day reason. It’s long time coming, today, Americans forced insurance visit healthcare.gov enroll affordable new plans offer quality coverage. starts today. people months sign up. months, people going opportunity cases, time lives affordable coverage desperately need. Now, course, you’re 85 percent Americans health insurance, don’t need thing. You’re benefiting new benefits protections place time law. 15 percent Americans don't health insurance, opportunity life-changing. Let tell folks stories represented today. years ago, Amanda Barrett left job New York care parents. while, temporary insurance covered multiple sclerosis. expired, insurers wouldn’t cover MS. ended paying $1,200 month. That’s near affordable. starting today, covered less, today’s new plan can’t medical history charge else. Sky-high premiums forced Nancy Beigel choose paying rent paying health insurance. She’s uninsured since. pays medical bills pocket, puts credit card, making harder pay. Nancy says, “They talk fall cracks. fell cracks 10 years ago I’ve stuck since.” Well, starting today, Nancy covered like else. Trinace Edwards laid job year ago today. months ago, diagnosed brain tumor. couldn’t afford insurance individual market, hasn’t received treatment yet. daughter Lenace, student University Maryland, dropping school help pay mom’s bills. Well, starting today, Affordable Care Act, Trinace covered forcing daughter dreams. stories hardworking Americans sound familiar you, well, starting today, friends family coworkers covered, too. visit healthcare.gov, compare insurance plans, side, way you’d shop plane ticket Kayak TV Amazon. enter basic information, you’ll presented list quality, affordable plans area, clear descriptions plan covers, cost. You’ll choices, competition, cases, lower prices uninsured Americans covered $100 less. don't word it. website, healthcare.gov, check yourself. family friends help covered, like mayors churches community groups companies fanning country. there’s hotline apply phone help application, questions answered real people, 150 languages. let number. number 1-800-318-2596 1-800-318-2596. Check healthcare.gov. number. family friends it. America covered, all, struggles folks millions country years finally addressed. let remind people think important. heard striking statistic yesterday cancer, 70 percent likely live years insurance don’t. Think that. means health insurance. Set issues security finances you’re impacted that, stress involved knowing you’re going health care. life-or-death stuff. Tens thousands Americans die year don’t health insurance. Millions live fear they’ll broke sick. today, begin free millions fellow Americans fear. Already, millions young adults able stay parents’ plans turn 26. Millions seniors discount prescription medicines. millions families actually received rebates insurance companies didn’t spend health care. law means choice, competition, lower costs millions Americans. law doesn’t mean economic security families. means we’re finally addressing biggest drivers long-term deficits. means stronger economy. Remember Republicans bunch predictions law haven’t come true. “death panels.” Costs haven’t skyrocketed; they’re growing slowest rate 50 years. years signed Affordable Care Act law slowest rates health spending growth record. contrary Republican claims, law hasn’t “destroyed” economy. past half years, businesses created 7.5 million new jobs. today, learned manufacturers growing fastest rate half years. factored Affordable Care Act. don't think it’s problem. What’s weighing economy Affordable Care Act, constant series crises unwillingness pass reasonable budget faction Republican Party. Now, like new law, new product rollout, going glitches signup process way fix.

I’ve listened foreign partners, privacy advocates, industry leaders. administration spent countless hours approach intelligence era diffuse threats technological revolution. outlining specific changes I’ve ordered, let broad observations emerged process. First, looked problems, including skeptics existing programs, recognizes real enemies threats, intelligence serves vital role confronting them. prevent terrorist attacks cyber threats capability penetrate digital communications it’s unravel terrorist plot; intercept malware targets stock exchange; sure air traffic control systems compromised; ensure hackers bank accounts. expected protect American people; requires capabilities field.

Given unique power state, leaders say: Trust us, won’t abuse data collect. history examples trust breached. government built premise liberty depend intentions power; depends law constrain power. observations underscore basic values Americans comes questions surveillance privacy converge crude characterizations emerged months. troubled existing programs interested repeating tragedy 9/11, defend programs dismissive civil liberties. challenge details right, simple. fact, course review, reminded today courage dissidents like Dr. King, spied government. President, looks intelligence morning, can’t help reminded America vigilant face threats. Fortunately, focusing specifics speculation hypotheticals, review process given hopefully American people clear direction change. today, announce series concrete substantial reforms administration intends adopt administratively seek codify Congress. First, approved new presidential directive signals intelligence activities home abroad. guidance strengthen executive branch oversight intelligence activities. ensure account security requirements, alliances; trade investment relationships, including concerns American companies; commitment privacy basic liberties. review decisions intelligence priorities sensitive targets annual basis actions regularly scrutinized senior national security team. Second, reform programs procedures place greater transparency surveillance activities, fortify safeguards protect privacy U.S. persons. began review, including released today, declassified 40 opinions orders Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, judicial review sensitive intelligence activities including Section 702 program targeting foreign individuals overseas, Section 215 telephone metadata program. going forward, I’m directing Director National Intelligence, consultation Attorney General, annually review purposes declassification future opinions court broad privacy implications, report Congress efforts. ensure court hears broader range privacy perspectives, calling Congress authorize establishment panel advocates government independent voice significant cases Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Third, additional protections activities conducted Section 702, allows government intercept communications foreign targets overseas that’s important national security. Specifically, asking Attorney General DNI institute reforms place additional restrictions government’s ability retain, search, criminal cases communications Americans foreign citizens incidentally collected Section 702. Fourth, investigating threats, FBI relies what's called national security letters, require companies specific limited government disclosing orders subject investigation. cases it's important subject investigation, possible terrorist spy, isn’t tipped off. transparent government uses authority. directed Attorney General amend national security letters secrecy indefinite, terminate fixed time government demonstrates real need secrecy. enable communications providers public orders received data government. brings program generated controversy past months bulk collection telephone records Section 215. Let repeat story broke: program involve content phone calls, names people making calls. Instead, record phone numbers times lengths calls metadata queried reasonable suspicion number linked terrorist organization. necessary? program grew desire address gap identified 9/11. 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar phone San Diego known Qaeda safe-house Yemen. NSA saw call, coming individual United States. telephone metadata program Section 215 designed map communications terrorists contact quickly possible. capability prove valuable crisis. example, bomb goes cities law enforcement racing determine network poised conduct additional attacks, time essence. able quickly review phone connections assess network exists critical effort. sum, program involve NSA examining phone records ordinary Americans. Rather, consolidates records database government query specific lead consolidation phone records companies retained business purposes. review group turned indication database intentionally abused. believe important capability program designed meet preserved. that, believe critics right point proper safeguards, type program yield private lives, open door intrusive bulk collection programs future. They’re right point telephone bulk collection program subject oversight Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court reauthorized repeatedly Congress, subject vigorous public debate. reasons, believe need new approach. ordering transition end Section 215 bulk metadata program currently exists, establish mechanism preserves capabilities need government holding bulk metadata. simple. review group recommended current approach replaced providers party retain bulk records, government accessing needed. options pose difficult problems. Relying solely records multiple providers, example, require companies alter procedures ways raise new privacy concerns. hand, party maintaining single, consolidated database carrying essentially government function expense, legal ambiguity, potentially accountability doubtful impact increasing public confidence privacy protected. review process, suggested able preserve capabilities need combination existing authorities, sharing, recent technological advances. work needs determine exactly work. challenges involved, I’ve ordered transition away existing program proceed steps. Effective immediately, pursue phone calls steps removed number associated terrorist organization current three. directed Attorney General work Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court transition period, database queried judicial finding case true emergency. Next, step two, instructed intelligence community Attorney General transition period develop options new approach match capabilities gaps Section 215 program designed address government holding metadata itself. report options alternative approaches program comes reauthorization March 28th. period, consult relevant committees Congress seek views, seek congressional authorization new program needed. Now, reforms I’m proposing today American people greater confidence rights protected, intelligence law enforcement agencies maintain tools need safe. recognize additional issues require debate. example, participated review, members Congress, like sweeping reforms national security letters judge time issuing requests. Here, concerns set standard terrorism investigations higher involved investigating ordinary crime. agree greater oversight letters appropriate, I’m prepared work Congress issue. like changes FISA Court ones I’ve proposed. issues, open working Congress ensure build broad consensus forward, I’m confident shape approach meets security needs upholding civil liberties American. Let turn separate set concerns raised overseas, focus America’s approach intelligence collection abroad. I’ve indicated, United States unique responsibilities comes intelligence collection. capabilities help protect nation, friends allies, well. efforts effective ordinary citizens countries confidence United States respects privacy, too. leaders close friends allies deserve know want know think issue, I’ll pick phone them, turning surveillance. words, balance security privacy home, global leadership demands balance security requirements need maintain trust cooperation people leaders world. reason, new presidential directive I’ve issued today clearly prescribe do, do, comes overseas surveillance. begin with, directive makes clear United States uses signals intelligence legitimate national security purposes, purpose indiscriminately reviewing emails phone calls ordinary folks. I’ve clear United States collect intelligence suppress criticism dissent, collect intelligence disadvantage people basis ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs. collect intelligence competitive advantage U.S. companies U.S. commercial sectors. terms bulk collection signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies data meet specific security requirements: counterintelligence, counterterrorism, counter-proliferation, cybersecurity, force protection troops allies, combating transnational crime, including sanctions evasion. directive, taken unprecedented step extending protections American people people overseas. I’ve directed DNI, consultation Attorney General, develop safeguards, limit duration hold personal information, restricting information. line people world, regardless nationality, know United States spying ordinary people don’t threaten national security, privacy concerns account policies procedures. applies foreign leaders well. Given understandable attention issue received, clear intelligence community compelling national security purpose, monitor communications heads state government close friends allies. I’ve instructed national security team, intelligence community, work foreign counterparts deepen coordination cooperation ways rebuild trust going forward. let clear: intelligence agencies continue gather intentions governments opposed ordinary citizens world, way intelligence services nation does. apologize simply services effective. heads state government work closely, cooperation depend, feel confident treating real partners. changes I’ve ordered that. Finally, sure follow reforms, making important changes government organized. State Department designate senior officer coordinate diplomacy issues technology signals intelligence. appoint senior official White House implement new privacy safeguards announced today. devote resources centralize improve process handle foreign requests legal assistance, keeping high standards privacy helping foreign partners fight crime terrorism. asked counselor, John Podesta, lead comprehensive review big data privacy. group consist government officials who, President’s Council Advisors Science Technology, reach privacy experts, technologists business leaders, look challenges inherent big data confronted public private sectors; forge international norms manage data; continue promote free flow ways consistent privacy security. ultimately, what’s stake debate goes far months headlines, passing tensions foreign policy. cut noise, what’s stake remain true world remaking dizzying speed. it’s ability individuals communicate ideas; access filled great library country world; forge bonds people sides globe, technology remaking possible individuals, institutions, international order. reforms announced point new direction, mindful work needed future. I’m of: debate stronger. know time change, United States America lead. America held standard. I'll admit readiness assume worst motives government frustrating. expects China open debate surveillance programs, Russia privacy concerns citizens places account. let’s remember: held standard precisely forefront defending personal privacy human dignity. nation developed Internet, world expects ensure digital revolution works tool individual empowerment, government control. faced dangers totalitarianism fascism communism, world expects stand principle person right think write form relationships freely individual freedom wellspring human progress. values are. strength democracy, shy away high expectations. centuries, Constitution weathered type change willing defend it, willing actions taken defense.

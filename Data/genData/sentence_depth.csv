2008-06-04,oba,My -- My differences with him -- My differences with him are not personal.,2
2008-06-04,oba,"They are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign, because while John McCain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his Party in the past, such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign.",6
2008-06-04,oba,"It’s not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year.",6
2008-06-04,oba,"It’s not change when he offers four more years of Bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying jobs, or insure our workers, or help Americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college, policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average American family, and widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street, and left our children with a mountain of debt.",15
2008-06-04,oba,"It’s not change when he promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians, a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in Iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isn’t making the American people any safer.",13
2008-06-04,oba,"So -- So, I’ll say this: There are many words to describe John McCain’s attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush’s policies as bipartisan and new, but “change” is not one of them.",1
2008-06-04,oba,"“Change” is not one of them, because change is a foreign policy that doesn’t begin and end with a war that should’ve never been authorized and never been waged.",9
2008-06-04,oba,"I won’t stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in Iraq, but what’s not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years, especially at a time when our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other threat to America is being ignored.",6
2008-06-04,oba,"We -- We must be -- We must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in, but we -- but start leaving we must.",5
2008-06-04,oba,It’s time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their future.,6
2008-06-04,oba,It’s time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care and the benefits they deserve when they come home.,8
2008-06-04,oba,"It’s time -- It's time to refocus our efforts on Al Qaida’s leadership and Afghanistan, and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease.",1
2008-06-04,oba,That’s what change is.,2
2008-06-04,oba,"Change -- Change, Minnesota, is realizing that meetings today’s threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our diplomacy: tough -- tough, direct diplomacy, where the President of the United States isn’t afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we stand for.",10

2008-06-04,oba,"It’s understanding that the struggles facing working families can’t be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs, but by giving a middle-class tax break to those who need it, and investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation.",11
2008-06-04,oba,"It’s understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when Bill Clinton was President.",4
2008-06-04,oba,"John McCain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy -- cities in Michigan, and Ohio, and right here in Minnesota -- he’d understand the kind of change that people are looking for.",11
2008-06-04,oba,"Maybe if he went to Iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can’t pay the medical bills for a sister who’s ill, he’d understand she can’t afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy.",9
2008-06-04,oba,"She needs us to pass health care right now, a plan that guarantees insurance to every American who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it.",12
2008-06-04,oba,"That’s the change we need, Minnesota.",3
2008-06-04,oba,"Maybe -- Maybe if John McCain went to Pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but can’t even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one, he’d understand we can’t afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators.",8

2008-11-05,oba,"It drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth.",12
2008-11-05,oba,This is your victory.,2
2008-11-05,oba,And I know you didn't do this just to win an election.,4
2008-11-05,oba,And I know you didn't do it for me.,3
2008-11-05,oba,You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead.,6
2008-11-05,oba,"For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime: two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.",7
2008-11-05,oba,"Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us.",8
2008-11-05,oba,There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage or pay their doctors' bills or save enough for their child's college education.,9
2008-11-05,oba,"There's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair.",6
2008-11-05,oba,The road ahead will be long.,2
2008-11-05,oba,Our climb will be steep.,2
2008-11-05,oba,We may not get there in one year or even in one term.,3
2008-11-05,oba,"But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there.",3
2008-11-05,oba,"I promise you, we as a people will get there.",5
2008-11-05,oba,There will be setbacks and false starts.,3
2008-11-05,oba,There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as President.,6
2008-11-05,oba,And we know the government can't solve every problem.,3
2008-11-05,oba,But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face.,5
2008-11-05,oba,"I will listen to you, especially when we disagree.",2
2008-11-05,oba,"And, above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years -- block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.",7
2008-11-05,oba,What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night.,5
2008-11-05,oba,This victory alone is not the change we seek.,3
2008-11-05,oba,It is only the chance for us to make that change.,4
2008-11-05,oba,And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were.,6
2008-11-05,oba,"It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice.",5
2008-11-05,oba,"So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.",10
2008-11-05,oba,"Let us remember that, if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers.",6
2008-11-05,oba,"In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people.",4
2008-11-05,oba,Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.,9
2008-11-05,oba,"Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a Party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity.",9
2008-11-05,oba,Those are values that we all share.,4
2008-11-05,oba,"And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.",7
2008-11-05,oba,"As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours: ""We are not enemies but friends...."" ""Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.""",6
2008-11-05,oba,"And to those Americans who -- whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices.",5
2008-11-05,oba,I need your help.,2
2008-11-05,oba,"And I will be your President, too.",2
2008-11-05,oba,"And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.",11
2008-11-05,oba,To those -- To those who would tear the world down: We will defeat you.,6
2008-11-05,oba,To those who seek peace and security: We support you.,5
2008-11-05,oba,"And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright: Tonight we've proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.",9
2008-11-05,oba,That's the true genius of America: that America can change.,3
2008-11-05,oba,Our union can be perfected.,2
2008-11-05,oba,What we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.,4
2008-11-05,oba,This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations.,5
2008-11-05,oba,But one that's on my mind tonight's about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta.,8
2008-11-05,oba,She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.,12
2008-11-05,oba,She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.,8
2008-11-05,oba,"And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America -- the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.",8
2008-11-05,oba,"At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot: Yes we can.",8
2008-11-05,oba,"When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose: Yes we can.",8
2008-11-05,oba,"When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved: Yes we can.",5
2008-11-05,oba,"She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that ""we shall overcome"": Yes we can.",6
2008-11-05,oba,"A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination.",5
2008-11-05,oba,"And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change: Yes we can.",8
2008-11-05,oba,"America, we have come so far.",2
2008-11-05,oba,We have seen so much.,2
2008-11-05,oba,But there is so much more to do.,3
2008-11-05,oba,"So tonight, let us ask ourselves -- if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see?",9
2008-11-05,oba,What progress will we have made?,2
2008-11-05,oba,This is our chance to answer that call.,4
2008-11-05,oba,This is our moment.,2
2008-11-05,oba,"This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope.",11
2008-11-05,oba,"And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can.",8
2008-11-05,oba,Thank you.,1
2008-11-05,oba,God bless you.,1
2008-11-05,oba,And may God bless the United States of America.,3
2009-01-05,oba,All right.,1
2009-01-05,oba,"Well, thanks for taking the time to come in for a moment.",7
2009-01-05,oba,"You know, this is the core of my economic team, and the message of our meeting today is one that comes as no surprise to most Americans, and that is we are in a very difficult spot.",8
2009-01-05,oba,The economy is bad.,2
2009-01-05,oba,The situation is getting worse.,2
2009-01-05,oba,"Last week, we learned that manufacturing had hit a 20-year low.",4
2009-01-05,oba,"On Friday, we're going to get the final jobs report from this year, and every indication is that we will have lost in 2008 more jobs than at any time since World War II.",9
2009-01-05,oba,It's clear that we have to act and we have to act now to address this crisis and break the momentum of the recession or the next few years could be dramatically worse.,9
2009-01-05,oba,That's the message that I delivered to Speaker Pelosi this morning.,5
2009-01-05,oba,I will be meeting with Harry Reid and with the bipartisan leadership group this afternoon.,4
2009-01-05,oba,"And the most important message today is that the situation is getting worse, we've got to act boldly, and we've got to act swiftly.",4
2009-01-05,oba,We cannot delay.,1
2009-01-05,oba,"I said in my Web address this past Saturday, this is not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem at this stage.",6
2009-01-05,oba,"This is an American problem, and we're all going to have to chip in and do the hard work that's required and what the American people expect of us.",9
2009-01-05,oba,"Over the last few weeks, our economic crisis has only grown deeper.",3
2009-01-05,oba,Two million Americans have now lost their jobs over the last year.,3
2009-01-05,oba,"We have a substantial number -- in fact, Christina Romer, our economist from the Council of Economic Advisers, indicates to me that in addition to the 2 million who've lost jobs, you've got 2.8 million who have moved from full-time work to part-time work.",7
2009-01-05,oba,"So when you start counting in people who are underemployed, then the situation is very dire for American families.",6
2009-01-05,oba,"Again, manufacturing's hit a 28-year low.",3
2009-01-05,oba,"Across America, millions of Americans are struggling with rising costs, growing debts, concerns about home foreclosure, a deepening sense of unease.",4
2009-01-05,oba,"When I last met with my team, I asked them to continue their work on an American recovery and reinvestment plan that would not only create jobs in the short term, but also spur economic growth and lay the foundation for a sustained competitiveness in this global economy over the long term.",8
2009-01-05,oba,"During today's meeting, I learned about the substantial progress that they've made in developing that plan.",7
2009-01-05,oba,And we are beginning to share details of that plan with leadership on the Hill.,9
2009-01-05,oba,"And we will be rolling this out to the American people, assuring that there is clarity and transparency about the entire process.",6
2009-01-05,oba,"One of the things that I've emphasized to my team -- and one of the things that I've emphasized to congressional leadership and will emphasize again today -- is that not only do we have to act boldly, swiftly and with a sufficient magnitude to make a difference, but we've also got to do things in a new way.",8
2009-01-05,oba,It's not going to be sufficient for us just to fall back into the old Washington ways and simply throw money at the problem.,6
2009-01-05,oba,We need to demand vigorous oversight; we need to have strict accountability in terms of how the -- the recovery and reinvestment plan operates.,9
2009-01-05,oba,"The American people have a right to know how every dime of their money is spent, and that is going to be built into the plan, so that everybody understands what is being done in order to address this crisis.",8
2009-01-05,oba,We also in this group talked today about the financial system that is still precarious.,4
2009-01-05,oba,"We have not seen the credit markets recover the way we would have liked to see them recover, despite the efforts of Treasury and of the Fed, the many unprecedented steps that have been taken.",7
2009-01-05,oba,"And so part of this team's task is to shape the next phase of economic recovery so that it is more transparent, so that it is more consistent, so that the public and the markets and businesses all understand exactly how it is working, what our expectations are and what will be accomplished as a consequence of some of the extraordinary steps that have been taken.",14
2009-01-05,oba,"Finally, we talked today about the tough choices that we're going to have to make to restore fiscal responsibility, so as the economy recovers, our deficit can start to be brought down.",8
2009-01-05,oba,"As I said earlier, right now, the most important task for us is to stabilize the patient.",3
2009-01-05,oba,The economy is badly damaged; it is very sick.,3
2009-01-05,oba,And so we have to take whatever is -- steps are required to make sure that it is stabilized.,5
2009-01-05,oba,"But we also have to recognize that if we're going to grow this economy over the long term, if we're going to create a better future for our children and our grandchildren, then we can't be fiscally irresponsible about how we do it.",9
2009-01-05,oba,"And so -- we have been in deep conversations and will continue over the next several weeks to shape our recovery and reinvestment package alongside very concrete, serious plans for midterm and long- term fiscal discipline.",9
2009-01-05,oba,And that is something that we will be also be presenting to the American people as well as leadership on Capitol Hill.,8
2009-01-05,oba,So I'm looking forward to meeting with both the Democrats and Republicans this afternoon.,5
2009-01-05,oba,"My expectation is that they will share the same sense of urgency that I do, that we are going to move quickly, that we're not going to get bogged down in a lot of old-style politics on either side.",9
2009-01-05,oba,There's not going to be a lot of finger-pointing or posturing.,5
2009-01-05,oba,The American people need action now.,2
2009-01-05,oba,That's what I intend to provide as president of the United States.,7
2009-01-05,oba,"So with that, let me take a couple questions.",4
2009-01-20,oba,"I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of the President of the United States faithfully, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help me God.",14
2009-01-20,oba,"Thank you, thank you.",2
2009-01-20,oba,"My fellow citizens:

I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you've bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.",11
2009-01-20,oba,"I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.",5
2009-01-20,oba,Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential Oath.,3
2009-01-20,oba,The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.,5
2009-01-20,oba,"Yet, every so often the Oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.",4
2009-01-20,oba,"At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers [sic], and true to our founding documents.",7
2009-01-20,oba,So it has been.,1
2009-01-20,oba,So it must be with this generation of Americans.,4
2009-01-20,oba,That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood.,5
2009-01-20,oba,"Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.",5
2009-01-20,oba,"Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.",8
2009-01-20,oba,Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.,3
2009-01-20,oba,Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.,6
2009-01-20,oba,"These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.",5
2009-01-20,oba,"Less measurable, but no less profound, is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights.",6
2009-01-20,oba,Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real.,4
2009-01-20,oba,They are serious and they are many.,2
2009-01-20,oba,They will not be met easily or in a short span of time.,4
2009-01-20,oba,"But know this, America: They will be met.",3
2009-01-20,oba,"On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.",7
2009-01-20,oba,"On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.",7
2009-01-20,oba,"We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to ""set aside childish things.""",5
2009-01-20,oba,"The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.",9
2009-01-20,oba,"In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.",6
2009-01-20,oba,It must be earned.,1
2009-01-20,oba,Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less.,4
2009-01-20,oba,"It has not been the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.",6
2009-01-20,oba,"Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things -- some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.",9
2009-01-20,oba,"For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.",6
2009-01-20,oba,"For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.",5
2009-01-20,oba,"For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.",8
2009-01-20,oba,Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life.,6
2009-01-20,oba,They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.,7
2009-01-20,oba,This is the journey we continue today.,3
2009-01-20,oba,"We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth.",3
2009-01-20,oba,Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began.,5
2009-01-20,oba,"Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year.",6
2009-01-20,oba,Our capacity remains undiminished.,2
2009-01-20,oba,"But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed.",6
2009-01-20,oba,"Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.",6
2009-01-20,oba,"For everywhere we look, there is work to be done.",3
2009-01-20,oba,"The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.",6
2009-01-20,oba,"We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.",5
2009-01-20,oba,"We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.",4
2009-01-20,oba,We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.,4
2009-01-20,oba,And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.,5
2009-01-20,oba,All this we can do.,2
2009-01-20,oba,All this we will do.,2
2009-01-20,oba,"Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.",6
2009-01-20,oba,Their memories are short.,2
2009-01-20,oba,"For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.",4
2009-01-20,oba,What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.,5
2009-01-20,oba,"The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.",6
2009-01-20,oba,"Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward.",3
2009-01-20,oba,"Where the answer is no, programs will end.",3
2009-01-20,oba,"And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.",8
2009-01-20,oba,"Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control.",5
2009-01-20,oba,The nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.,3
2009-01-20,oba,"The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.",8
2009-01-20,oba,"As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.",5
2009-01-20,oba,"Our Founding Fathers -- Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.",8
2009-01-20,oba,"Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience'sake.",3
2009-01-20,oba,"And so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: Know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity.",10
2009-01-20,oba,And we are ready to lead once more.,4
2009-01-20,oba,"Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.",6
2009-01-20,oba,"They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.",4
2009-01-20,oba,"Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.",5
2009-01-20,oba,We are the keepers of this legacy.,4

2009-04-02,oba,Let me outline what I think has been most significant.,5
2009-04-02,oba,"Number one, we are committed to growth and job creation.",5
2009-04-02,oba,"All G20 nations have acted to stimulate demand, which will total well over $2 trillion in global fiscal expansion.",7
2009-04-02,oba,"The United States is also partnering with the private sector to clean out the troubled assets, the legacy assets that are crippling some banks, and using the full force of the government to ensure that our action leads directly to loans to businesses large and small, as well as individuals who depend on credit.",10

2009-04-02,oba,"Together, the G20 is tripling the IMF's lending capacity and promoting lending by multilateral development banks to increase the purchasing power and expand markets in every country.",6
2009-04-02,oba,We've also rejected the protectionism that could deepen this crisis.,4
2009-04-02,oba,History tells us that turning inward can help turn a downturn into a depression.,5
2009-04-02,oba,"And this cooperation between the world's leading economies signals our support for open markets, as does our multilateral commitment to trade finance that will grow our exports and create new jobs.",8
2009-04-02,oba,That's all on the growth front.,3
2009-04-02,oba,And next we made enormous strides in committing ourselves to comprehensive reform of a failed regulatory system.,7
2009-04-02,oba,"And together, I believe that we must put an end to the bubble-and-bust economy that has stood in the way of sustained growth and enabled abusive risk-taking that endangers our prosperity.",9
2009-04-02,oba,"At home, back in the States, our efforts began with the approach that Secretary Geithner proposed last week, the strongest regulatory reforms any nation has contemplated so far to prevent the massive failure of responsibility that we have already seen.",8
2009-04-02,oba,"Today, these principles have informed and enabled the coordinated action that we will take with our G20 partners.",6

2009-04-02,oba,"We've all got our own national policies; we all have our own assumptions, our own political cultures.",3

2009-04-02,oba,"So I'm pleased that the G20 has agreed to meet again this fall, because I believe that this is just the beginning.",5
2009-04-02,oba,Our problems are not going to be solved in one meeting; they're not going to be solved in two meetings.,5
2009-04-02,oba,We're going to have to be proactive in shaping events and persistent in monitoring our progress to determine whether further action is needed.,12
2009-04-02,oba,I also want to just make a few remarks about additional meetings I had outside of the G20 context.,9
2009-04-02,oba,"While here in London I had the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with leaders of Russia, China, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and India, as well as Great Britain.",11
2009-04-02,oba,And these discussions were extraordinarily valuable and productive.,2
2009-04-02,oba,"Of course, we spoke about additional steps to promote economic recovery and growth.",5
2009-04-02,oba,But we also discussed coordinated actions on a range of issues:  how we could reduce the nuclear threat; how we could forge a coordinated response to North Korea's planned missile launch; how we can turn back terrorism and stabilize Afghanistan; how we can protect our planet from the scourge of climate change.,8
2009-04-02,oba,I'm encouraged that we laid the groundwork for real and lasting progress on a host of these issues.,9

2009-04-02,oba,"Agreement will almost never be easy, and results won't always come quickly.",2
2009-04-02,oba,"But I am committed to respecting different points of view, and to forging a consensus instead of dictating our terms.",6
2009-04-02,oba,That's how we made progress in the last few days.,4
2009-04-02,oba,And that's how we will advance and uphold our ideals in the months and years to come.,5
2009-04-02,oba,"You know, at home, I've often spoken about a new era of responsibility.",4
2009-04-02,oba,And I believe strongly that this era must not end at our borders.,4
2009-04-02,oba,"In a world that's more and more interconnected, we all have responsibilities to work together to solve common challenges.",5
2009-04-02,oba,"And although it will take time, I am confident that we will rebuild global prosperity if we act with a common sense of purpose, persistence, and the optimism that the moment demands.",12
2009-04-02,oba,"So I appreciate your attention, and I'm going to take a few questions.",4
2009-04-02,oba,I've got a list of a few people I'm going to call on and then I will intersperse some folks I'm calling on randomly.,6
2009-04-15,oba,"Well, to President DeGioia, thank you so much for the gracious introduction, and thanks for bringing your family -- including JT -- appreciate you.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"We're going to invite him over, hang out with the girls.",4
2009-04-15,oba,He's a pretty good-looking young man.,3
2009-04-15,oba,"To Mayor Adrian Fenty, who's doing such a great job in this city, thank you so much for your attendance.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"To Representative Donna Edwards, who is here and represents Maryland's 4th District, thank you.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"To Georgetown University students, it is great to be here.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"Well, it is good to be back.",2
2009-04-15,oba,"I appeared in this room during the campaign and had a wonderful reception then, and it's wonderful to be back and be with all of you.",7
2009-04-15,oba,We're going to talk about the economy today.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"And I was telling President DeGioia this may be a slightly longer speech than I usually give, but it's a slightly bigger topic, and that is how we are going to deal with so many of our economic challenges.",10
2009-04-15,oba,"You know, it's been 12 weeks now since my administration began.",3
2009-04-15,oba,"And I think that even our critics would agree that at the very least, we've been busy.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"In just under three months, we've responded to an extraordinary set of economic challenges with extraordinary action -- action that's been unprecedented both in terms of its scale and its speed.",10
2009-04-15,oba,And I know that some have accused us of taking on too much at once.,5
2009-04-15,oba,Others believe we haven't done enough.,2
2009-04-15,oba,"And many Americans are simply wondering how all of our different programs and policies fit together in a single, overarching strategy that will move this economy from recession to recovery and ultimately to prosperity.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"So today, I want to step back for a moment and explain our strategy as clearly as I can.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"This is going to be prose, and not poetry.",2
2009-04-15,oba,"I want to talk about what we've done, why we've done it, and what we have left to do.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"I want to update you on the progress we've made, but I also want to be honest about the pitfalls that may still lie ahead.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"Most of all, I want every American to know that each action we take and each policy we pursue is driven by a larger vision of America's future -- a future where sustained economic growth creates good jobs and rising incomes; a future where prosperity is fueled not by excessive debt, or reckless speculation, or fleeting profits, but is instead built by skilled, productive workers, by sound investments that will spread opportunity at home and allow this nation to lead the world in the technologies and the innovation and discoveries that will shape the 21st century.",16
2009-04-15,oba,That's the America I see.,3
2009-04-15,oba,That's the America that Georgetown is preparing so many of you for.,4
2009-04-15,oba,That is the future that I know that we can have.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, to understand how we get there, we first need to understand how we got here.",3
2009-04-15,oba,Recessions are not uncommon.,1
2009-04-15,oba,"Markets and economies naturally ebb and flow, as we've seen many times in our history.",4
2009-04-15,oba,But this recession is different.,2
2009-04-15,oba,This recession was not caused by a normal downturn in the business cycle.,5
2009-04-15,oba,It was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street.,6
2009-04-15,oba,"As has been widely reported, it started in the housing market.",3
2009-04-15,oba,"During the course of the decade, the formula for buying a house changed: Instead of saving their pennies to buy their dream house, many Americans found that suddenly they could take out loans that by traditional standards their incomes just could not support.",6
2009-04-15,oba,Others were tricked into signing these subprime loans by lenders who were trying to make a quick profit.,8
2009-04-15,oba,The reason these loans were so readily available was that Wall Street saw big profits to be made.,5
2009-04-15,oba,"Investment banks would buy and package together these questionable mortgages into securities, arguing that by pooling the mortgages the risks had somehow been reduced.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"And credit agencies that are supposed to help investors determine the soundness of various investments stamped the securities with their safest rating when they should have been labeled ""Buyer Beware.""",8
2009-04-15,oba,"No one really knew what the actual value of these securities were, no one fully understood what the risks were.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"But since the housing market was booming and prices were rising, banks and investors just kept buying and selling them, always passing off the risk to someone else for a greater profit without having to take any of the ultimate responsibility.",8
2009-04-15,oba,Banks took on more debt than they could handle.,3
2009-04-15,oba,"The government-chartered companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose traditional mandate was to help support traditional mortgages, decided to get in on the action by buying and holding billions of dollars of these securities.",10
2009-04-15,oba,"AIG, the biggest insurer in the world that had a very traditional insurance business that was very profitable, decided to make profits suddenly by selling billions of dollars of complicated financial instruments that supposedly insured these securities.",11
2009-04-15,oba,Everybody was making record profits -- except the wealth created was real only on paper.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"And as the bubble grew, there was almost no accountability or oversight from anyone in Washington.",5
2009-04-15,oba,Then the housing bubble burst.,2
2009-04-15,oba,Home prices fell.,2
2009-04-15,oba,People began to default on their subprime mortgages.,4
2009-04-15,oba,And the value of all those loans and securities plummeted.,4
2009-04-15,oba,Banks and investors couldn't find anyone to buy them.,2
2009-04-15,oba,Greed gave way to fear.,2
2009-04-15,oba,Investors pulled their money out of the market.,4
2009-04-15,oba,Large financial institutions that didn't have enough money on hand to pay off all their obligations collapsed.,5
2009-04-15,oba,Other banks held on tight to their money and simply stopped lending.,5
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, this is when the crisis spread from Wall Street to Main Street.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"After all, the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to, as you all know very well, a college education.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"It's how stores stock their shelves, and farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.",3
2009-04-15,oba,"So when banks stopped lending money, businesses started laying off workers.",3
2009-04-15,oba,"When laid-off workers had less money to spend, businesses were forced to lay off even more workers.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"When people couldn't get a car loan, a bad situation at the auto companies became even worse.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"When people couldn't get home loans, the crisis in the housing market only deepened.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"Because the infected securities were being traded worldwide and other nations also had weak regulations, this recession soon became global.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"And when other nations can't afford to buy our goods, it slows our economy even further.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"So this is the situation, the downward spiral that we confronted on the day that we took office.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"So our most urgent task has been to clear away the wreckage, repair the immediate damage to the economy, and do everything we can to prevent a larger collapse.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"And since the problems we face are all working off each other to feed a vicious economic downturn, we've had no choice but to attack all fronts of our economic crisis simultaneously.",7
2009-04-15,oba,The first step was to fight a severe shortage of demand in the economy.,7
2009-04-15,oba,So the Federal Reserve did this by dramatically lowering interest rates last year in order to boost investment.,4
2009-04-15,oba,My administration and Congress boosted demand by passing the largest recovery plan in our nation's history.,7
2009-04-15,oba,It's a plan that's already in the process of saving or creating 3.5 million jobs over the next two years.,10
2009-04-15,oba,It's putting money directly into people's pockets with a tax cut for 95 percent of working families that's now showing up in paychecks across America.,9
2009-04-15,oba,"And to cushion the blow of this recession, we also provided extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own.",9
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, you will recall that some argued this recovery plan is a case of irresponsible government spending, that it's somehow to blame for our long-term deficit projections, and that the federal government should be cutting instead of increasing spending right now.",7
2009-04-15,oba,So I want to tackle this argument head on.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"To begin with, economists on both the left and the right agree that the last thing a government should do in the middle of a recession is to cut back on spending.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"You see, when this recession began, many families sat around the kitchen table and tried to figure out where they could cut back.",4
2009-04-15,oba,And so have many businesses.,2
2009-04-15,oba,And this is a completely reasonable and understandable reaction.,3
2009-04-15,oba,"But if everybody -- if everybody -- if every family in America, if every business in America cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money, which means there are no customers, which means there are more layoffs, which means the economy gets even worse.",12
2009-04-15,oba,That's why the government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to stimulate demand.,7
2009-04-15,oba,That's exactly what we're doing right now.,3
2009-04-15,oba,"Second, I absolutely agree that our long-term deficit is a major problem that we have to fix.",5
2009-04-15,oba,But the fact is that this recovery plan represents only a tiny fraction of that long-term deficit.,6
2009-04-15,oba,"As I'll discuss in a moment, the key to dealing with our long-term deficit and our national debt is to get a handle on out-of-control health care costs -- not to stand idly by as the economy goes into free fall.",7
2009-04-15,oba,So the recovery plan has been the first step in confronting this economic crisis.,5
2009-04-15,oba,The second step has been to heal our financial system so that credit is once again flowing to the businesses and families who rely on it.,7
2009-04-15,oba,The heart of this financial crisis is that too many banks and other financial institutions simply stopped lending money.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"In a climate of fear, banks were unable to replace their losses from some of those bad mortgages by raising new capital on their own, and they were unwilling to lend the money they did have because they were afraid that no one would pay it back.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"It's for this reason that the last administration used what they called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, to provide these banks with temporary financial assistance in order to get them lending again.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, I understand that TARP is not popular, and I have to say that I don't agree with some of the ways the TARP program was managed, but I do agree with the broader rationale that we must provide banks with the capital and the confidence necessary to start lending again.",12
2009-04-15,oba,That's the purpose of the stress tests that will soon tell us how much additional capital will be needed to support lending at our largest banks.,10
2009-04-15,oba,"Ideally, these needs will be met by private investors who are willing to put in money to these banks.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"But where that's not possible, and banks require substantial additional resources from the government, then we will hold accountable those who are responsible, we'll force the necessary adjustments, we'll provide the support to clean up those bank balance sheets, and we will assure the continuity of a strong and viable institution that can serve our people and our economy.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"Of course, there are some who differ with our approach.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"On the one hand, there are some who argue that the government should stand back and simply let these banks fail -- especially since in many cases it was their bad decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place.",10
2009-04-15,oba,"But whether we like it or not, history has shown repeatedly that when nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again, they have crises that last years and years instead of months and months -- years of low growth, years of low job creation, years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more than a course of bold, upfront action.",9
2009-04-15,oba,"And although there are a lot of Americans who understandably think that government money would be better spent going directly to families and businesses instead of to banks -- one of my most frequent questions in the letters that I get from constituents is, ""Where's my bailout?""",8
2009-04-15,oba,-- and I understand the sentiment.,2
2009-04-15,oba,"It makes sense intuitively, and morally it makes sense, but the truth is that a dollar of capital in a bank can actually result in $8 or $10 of loans to families and businesses.",11
2009-04-15,oba,So that's a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth.,7
2009-04-15,oba,That's why we have to fix the banks.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, on the other hand, there have been some who don't dispute that we need to shore up the banking system, but they suggest that we've been too timid in how we go about it.",7
2009-04-15,oba,This is essentially the nationalization argument that some of you may have heard.,5
2009-04-15,oba,"And the argument says that the federal government should have already preemptively stepped in and taken over major financial institutions the way that the FDIC currently intervenes in smaller banks, and that our failure, my administration's failure to do so is yet another example of Washington coddling Wall Street -- ""Why aren't you tougher on the banks?""",10
2009-04-15,oba,So let me be clear: The reason we have not taken this step has nothing to do with any ideological or political judgment we've made about government involvement in banks.,9
2009-04-15,oba,It's certainly not because of any concern we have for the management and shareholders whose actions helped to cause this mess.,8
2009-04-15,oba,"Rather, it's because we believe that preemptive government takeovers are likely to end up costing taxpayers even more in the end, and because it's more likely to undermine than create confidence.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"Governments should practice the same principle as doctors: First, do no harm.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"So rest assured -- we will do whatever is necessary to get credit flowing again, but we will do so in ways that minimize risks to taxpayers and to the broader economy.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"To that end, in addition to the program to provide capital to the banks, we've launched a plan that will pair government resources with private investment in order to clear away the old loans and securities -- the so-called toxic assets -- that are also preventing our banks from lending money.",10
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, what we've also learned during this crisis is that our banks aren't the only institutions affected by these toxic assets that are clogging the financial system.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"AIG, for example, is not a bank, it's an insurance company, as I mentioned -- and yet because it chose to insure billions of dollars worth of risky assets, essentially creating a hedge fund on top of an insurance company, its failure could threaten the entire financial system and freeze lending even more.",10
2009-04-15,oba,"And that's why, as frustrating as it is -- and I promise you, nobody is more frustrated than me with AIG -- I promise -- we had to provide support for AIG, because the entire system, as fragile as it is, could be profoundly endangered if AIG went into a liquidation bankruptcy.",9
2009-04-15,oba,"It's also why we need new legal authority so that we have the power to intervene in such financial institutions, the same way that bankruptcy courts currently do with businesses that hit hard times but don't pose systemic risks -- and that way we can restructure these businesses in an orderly way that doesn't induce panic in the financial system -- and, by the way, will allow us to restructure inappropriate bonus contracts without creating a perception the government can just change compensation rules on a whim.",10
2009-04-15,oba,"This is also why we're moving aggressively to unfreeze markets and jumpstart lending outside the banking system, where more than half of all lending in America actually takes place.",11
2009-04-15,oba,"To do this, we've started a program that will increase guarantees for small business loans and unlock the market for auto loans and student loans.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"And to stabilize the housing market, we've launched a plan that will save up to four million responsible homeowners from foreclosure and help many millions more to refinance their homes.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"In a few weeks, we will also reassess the state of Chrysler and General Motors, two companies with an important place in our history and a large footprint in our economy -- but two companies that have also fallen on hard times.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"Late last year, the companies were given transitional loans by the previous administration to tide them over as they worked to develop viable business plans.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"Unfortunately, the plans they developed fell short, so we've given them some additional time to work these complex issues through.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"And by the way, we owed that not to the executives whose bad bets contributed to the weakening of their companies, but to the hundreds of thousands of workers whose livelihoods hang in the balance -- entire towns, entire communities, entire states are profoundly impacted by what happens in the auto industry.",9
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, it is our fervent hope that in the coming weeks, Chrysler will find a viable partner and GM will develop a business plan that will put it on a path to profitability without endless support from American taxpayer.",10
2009-04-15,oba,"In the meantime, we're taking steps to spur demand for American cars and provide relief for autoworkers and their communities.",7
2009-04-15,oba,And we will continue to reaffirm this nation's commitment to a 21st-century American auto industry that creates new jobs and builds the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward a clean-energy future.,12
2009-04-15,oba,"Finally, to coordinate a global response to this global recession, I went to the meeting of the G20 nations in London the other week.",5
2009-04-15,oba,Each nation has undertaken significant stimulus to spur demand.,2
2009-04-15,oba,All agreed to pursue tougher regulatory reforms.,3
2009-04-15,oba,"We also agreed to triple the lending capacity of the International Monetary Fund -- which, as many of you know, is an international financial institution supported by all the major economies -- so that they can provide direct assistance to developing nations and vulnerable populations.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"That's not just charity; because America's success depends on whether other nations have the ability to buy what we sell, it's important that we pay attention to these emerging markets.",7
2009-04-15,oba,We pledged to avoid the trade barriers and protectionism that hurts us all in the end.,6
2009-04-15,oba,And we decided to meet again in the fall to gauge our progress and take additional steps if necessary.,5
2009-04-15,oba,"So that's where we've been, that's what we've done in the last three months.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"All of these actions -- the Recovery Act, the bank capitalization program, the housing plan, the strengthening of the non-bank credit market, the auto plan, and our work at the G20 -- all have been necessary pieces of the recovery puzzle.",10
2009-04-15,oba,They've been designed to increase aggregate demand to get credit flowing again to families and businesses and to help families and businesses ride out the storm.,8
2009-04-15,oba,"And taken together, these actions are starting to generate signs of economic progress.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"Because of our recovery plan, schools and police departments have cancelled planned layoffs; clean energy companies and construction companies are re-hiring workers to build everything from energy-efficient windows to new roads and highways.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"Our housing plan has helped lead to a spike in the number of homeowners who are taking advantage of historically-low mortgage rates by refinancing, which is like putting a $2,000 tax cut in your pocket.",14
2009-04-15,oba,Our program to support the market for auto loans and student loans has started to unfreeze this market and securitize more of this lending in the last few weeks.,7
2009-04-15,oba,And small businesses are seeing a jump in loan activity for the first time in months.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, this is all welcome and encouraging news.",3
2009-04-15,oba,"It does not mean the hard times are over; 2009 will continue to be a difficult year for America's economy, and obviously, most difficult for those who've lost their jobs.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"The severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more foreclosures, and more pain before it ends.",5
2009-04-15,oba,The market will continue to rise and fall.,2
2009-04-15,oba,Credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it should.,3
2009-04-15,oba,The process for restructuring AIG and the auto companies will involve difficult and sometimes unpopular choices; we are not finished yet on that front.,5
2009-04-15,oba,And all of this means that there's much more work to be done.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"But all of this also means that you can continue to expect an unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort from this administration to fight for economic recovery on all fronts.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"But even as we continue to clear away the wreckage and address the immediate crisis, it is my firm belief that our next task, beginning now, is to make sure such a crisis never happens again.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"Even as we clean up balance sheets and get credit flowing again, even as people start spending and businesses start hiring -- all that's going to happen -- we have to realize that we cannot go back to the bubble-and-bust economy that led us to this point.",9
2009-04-15,oba,It is simply not sustainable to have a 21st-century financial system that is governed by 20th-century rules and regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the entire economy.,12
2009-04-15,oba,"It is not sustainable to have an economy where in one year, 40 percent of our corporate profits came from a financial sector that was based on inflated home prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks and overvalued assets.",12
2009-04-15,oba,"It's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while the typical working household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2,000.",8
2009-04-15,oba,That's just not a sustainable model for long-term prosperity.,5
2009-04-15,oba,"For even as too many were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits over the last decade, we continued to neglect the long-term threats to our prosperity: the crushing burden that the rising cost of health care is placing on families and businesses; the failure of our education system to prepare our workers for a new age; the progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries and technologies while we -- we remain addicted to foreign oil; the growing debt that we're passing on to our children.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"Even after we emerge from the current recession, these challenges will still represent major obstacles that stand in the way of our success in the 21st century.",7
2009-04-15,oba,So we've got a lot of work to do.,3
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, there's a parable at the end of the Sermon on the Mount that tells the story of two men.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"The first built his house on a pile of sand, and it was soon destroyed when a storm hit.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"But the second is known as the wise man, for when ""the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.""",8
2009-04-15,oba,It was founded upon a rock.,3
2009-04-15,oba,We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand.,4
2009-04-15,oba,We must build our house upon a rock.,3
2009-04-15,oba,We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest; where we consume less at home and send more exports abroad.,13
2009-04-15,oba,"It's a foundation built upon five pillars that will grow our economy and make this new century another American century: Number one, new rules for Wall Street that will reward drive and innovation, not reckless risk-taking; number two, new investments in education that will make our workforce more skilled and competitive; number three, new investments in renewable energy and technology that will create new jobs and new industries; number four, new investments in health care that will cut costs for families and businesses; and number five, new savings in our federal budget that will bring down the debt for future generations.",10
2009-04-15,oba,That's the new foundation we must build.,3
2009-04-15,oba,That's our house built upon a rock.,5
2009-04-15,oba,That must be our future -- and my administration's policies are designed to achieve that future.,4
2009-04-15,oba,Let me talk about each of these steps in turn.,6
2009-04-15,oba,The first step we will take to build this foundation is to reform the outdated rules and regulations that allowed this crisis to happen in the first place.,7
2009-04-15,oba,It is time to lay down tough new rules of the road for Wall Street to ensure that we never find ourselves here again.,6
2009-04-15,oba,"Just as after the Great Depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation that helped to create the depression, so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules: create rules that punish shortcuts and abuse; rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance --- a novel concept; rules that protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k).",10
2009-04-15,oba,So we've already begun to work with Congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatory framework -- and I expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is out.,5
2009-04-15,oba,The second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our workers for a 21st century economy.,6
2009-04-15,oba,"You know, in the 20th century, the G.I.",3
2009-04-15,oba,Bill helped send a generation to college.,3
2009-04-15,oba,"For decades we led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence we led the world in economic growth.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"But in this new economy, we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educational achievement, in the production of scientists and engineers.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"That's why we have set a goal that will greatly enhance our ability to compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century: By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.",11
2009-04-15,oba,That is the goal that we have set and we intend to do.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"To meet that goal, we have to start early.",3
2009-04-15,oba,So we've already dramatically expanded early childhood education.,2
2009-04-15,oba,We are investing in innovative programs that have proven to help schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps.,8
2009-04-15,oba,We're creating new rewards that tie teachers' performance and new pathways for advancement.,5
2009-04-15,oba,"And I've asked every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training, and we have provided tax credits to make a college education more affordable for every American, even those who attend Georgetown.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"And, by the way, one of the changes that I would like to see -- and I'm going to be talking about this in weeks to come -- is once again seeing our best and our brightest commit themselves to making things -- engineers, scientists, innovators.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"For so long, we have placed at the top of our pinnacle folks who can manipulate numbers and engage in complex financial calculations.",9
2009-04-15,oba,"And that's good, we need some of that.",3
2009-04-15,oba,"But you know what we can really use is some more scientists and some more engineers, who are building and making things that we can export to other countries.",10
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, the third pillar of this new foundation is to harness the renewable energy that can create millions of new jobs and new industries.",8
2009-04-15,oba,We all know that the country that harnesses this new energy source will lead the 21st century.,5
2009-04-15,oba,Yet we've allowed other countries to outpace us on this race to the future.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"I don't know about you, but I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders.",6
2009-04-15,oba,I think it's time for America to lead again.,4
2009-04-15,oba,So the investments we made in the Recovery Act will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in the next three years.,5
2009-04-15,oba,And we are putting Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions on our energy bills and grow our economy at the same time.,6
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, the only though that we can truly spark the transformation that's need is through a gradual, market-based cap on carbon pollution, so that clean energy is the profitable kind of energy.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"There are those who've argued that we shouldn't attempt, we shouldn't even be thinking, we shouldn't even be talking about such a transition until the economy recovers.",6
2009-04-15,oba,And they are right that we have to take into account the costs of transition.,6
2009-04-15,oba,Transitioning to a clean energy economy will not be easy.,4
2009-04-15,oba,But we can no longer delay putting a framework for a clean energy economy in place.,4
2009-04-15,oba,That needs to be done now.,2
2009-04-15,oba,"If businesses and entrepreneurs know today that we are closing this carbon pollution loophole, they'll start investing in clean energy now.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"And pretty soon, we'll see more companies constructing solar panels, and workers building wind turbines, and car companies manufacturing fuel-efficient cars.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"Investors will put some money into a new energy technology, and a small business will open to start selling it.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"That's how we can grow this economy, enhance our security, and protect our planet at the same time.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, the fourth pillar of our new foundation is a 21st century health care system where families, businesses and government budgets aren't dragged down by skyrocketing insurance premiums.",6
2009-04-15,oba,One and a half million Americans could lose their homes this year just because of a medical crisis.,4
2009-04-15,oba,Major American corporations are struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts.,4
2009-04-15,oba,Small businesses are closing their doors.,2
2009-04-15,oba,We can't allow the cost of health care to continue strangling our economy.,5
2009-04-15,oba,And that's why our Recovery Act will invest in electronic health records with strict privacy standards that can save money and lives and reduce medical error.,7
2009-04-15,oba,"That's why we've made the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep costs under control.",7
2009-04-15,oba,And included in the budgets that just passed Congress is an historic commitment to reform that will finally make quality health care affordable for every American.,5
2009-04-15,oba,So I'm looking forward in the next few months to working with both parties in Congress to make this reform a reality.,6
2009-04-15,oba,We can get this done -- and we have to get it done.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, fixing our health care system will -- will require resources; it's not going to be free.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"But in my budget we've made a commitment to fully pay for reform without increasing the deficit, and we've identified specific savings that will make the health care system more efficient and reduce costs for us all.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"In fact, we've undertaken an unprecedented effort to find this kind of savings in every corner of the budget, because the final pillar in building our new foundation is restoring fiscal discipline once this economy recovers.",7
2009-04-15,oba,Already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"We need to do more, but we've already done that.",2
2009-04-15,oba,We've announced procurement reform that will greatly reduce no-bid contracts and save the government $40 billion.,5
2009-04-15,oba,"We need to do more, but that's an important start.",3
2009-04-15,oba,Secretary Gates recently announced a courageous set of reforms that go right at the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and cost overruns that have bloated our defense budget without making America safer.,15
2009-04-15,oba,"We need to do more, but that proposal by Secretary Gates is right on target.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"We will end education programs that don't work, we will root out waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"Altogether, this budget will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share of the economy by more than 10 percent over the next decade to the lowest level we've seen since we began keeping records nearly half a century ago.",10
2009-04-15,oba,"And as we continue to go through the federal budget line by line, we will be announcing additional savings, secured by eliminating and consolidating programs that we don't need so we can make room for the things that we do need.",7
2009-04-15,oba,That's what we're doing now.,2
2009-04-15,oba,"Of course, I realize that for some, this isn't enough.",3
2009-04-15,oba,"I know there's a criticism out there that my administration has been spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agenda while mortgaging our children's future.",8
2009-04-15,oba,You've heard the argument.,2
2009-04-15,oba,"Well, let me make three points.",3
2009-04-15,oba,"First, as I said earlier, the worst thing that we could do in a recession this severe is to try to cut government spending at the same time as families and businesses around the world are cutting back on their spending.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"So as serious as our deficit and debt problems are -- and they are very serious -- major efforts to deal with them have to focus on the medium and long-term budget picture, not on the short-term.",6
2009-04-15,oba,And that's exactly what we've done.,3
2009-04-15,oba,"Second, in tackling the deficit issue, we simply cannot sacrifice the long-term investments that we so desperately need to generate long-term prosperity.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"That's the argument that some critics have made: Well, you're proposing health care reform, you shouldn't be doing that; you're proposing education investments, you shouldn't be doing that, that adds to the deficit.",9
2009-04-15,oba,"Look, just as a cash-strapped family may cut back on all kinds of luxuries, but will still insist on spending money to get their children through college, will refuse to have their kids drop out of college and go to work in some fast-food place, even though that might bring in some income in the short-term, because they're thinking about the long term -- so we as a country have to make current choices with an eye for the future.",9
2009-04-15,oba,"If we don't invest now in renewable energy, if we don't invest now in a skilled workforce, if we don't invest now in a more affordable health care system, this economy simply won't grow at the pace it needs to in two or five or 10 years down the road.",5
2009-04-15,oba,"If we don't lay this new foundation now, it won't be long before we're right back where we are today.",3
2009-04-15,oba,And I can assure you that chronically slow growth will not help our long-term budget situation.,4
2009-04-15,oba,That's the second point.,2
2009-04-15,oba,"Third point, the problem with our deficit and debt is not new.",4
2009-04-15,oba,"It has been building dramatically over the past eight years, largely because big tax cuts combined with increased spending on two wars and the increased costs of government health care programs have pushed it ever upwards.",12
2009-04-15,oba,"This structural gap in our budget, between the amount of money that's coming in and the amount of money that's going out, will only get worse as the baby boomers age, and will in fact lead us down an unsustainable path.",6
2009-04-15,oba,But let's not kid ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a few earmarks or cutting the budget for the National Endowment for the Arts.,11
2009-04-15,oba,That's just not true.,1
2009-04-15,oba,"Along with defense and interest on the national debt, the biggest cost drivers in our budget are entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security -- all of which get more and more expensive every year.",7
2009-04-15,oba,"So if we want to get serious about fiscal discipline, and I do, then we're going to not only have to trim waste out of our discretionary budget -- which we've already begun -- we will also have to get serious about entitlement reform.",8
2009-04-15,oba,"Now, nothing will be more important to this goal than passing health care reform that brings down costs across the system, including in Medicare and Medicaid.",9
2009-04-15,oba,"So make no mistake, health care reform is entitlement reform.",3
2009-04-15,oba,That's not just my opinion -- that was the conclusion of a wide range of participants at the Fiscal Responsibility Summit that we held at the White House in February.,11
2009-04-15,oba,And that's one of the reasons why I firmly believe we need to get health care reform done this year.,10
2009-04-15,oba,"Once we tackle rising health care costs, we must also work to put Social Security on firmer footing.",4
2009-04-15,oba,It's time for both parties to come together and find a way to keep the promise of a sound retirement for future generations.,11
2009-04-15,oba,And we should restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code including by shutting down corporate loopholes and ensuring that everyone pays what they owe.,6
2009-04-15,oba,All of these efforts will require tough choices.,4
2009-04-15,oba,All these efforts will require compromise.,2
2009-04-15,oba,But the difficulties can't serve as an excuse for inaction -- not anymore -- which brings me to one final point I'd like to make today.,8
2009-04-15,oba,I've talked a lot about the fundamental weakness in our economy that led us to this day of reckoning.,7
2009-04-15,oba,But we also arrived here because of a fundamental weakness in our political system.,5
2009-04-15,oba,"For too long, too many in Washington put off hard decisions for some other time on some other day.",3
2009-04-15,oba,There's been a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve real problems.,5
2009-04-15,oba,There's also an impatience that characterizes this town -- an attention span that has only grown shorter with the 24-hour news cycle that insists on instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher poll numbers.,17
2009-04-15,oba,"When a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from shock to trance, with everyone responding to the tempest of the moment until the furor has died down, the media coverage has moved on to something else, instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way.",9
2009-04-15,oba,This can't be one of those times.,4
2009-04-15,oba,The challenges are too great.,2
2009-04-15,oba,The stakes are too high.,2
2009-04-15,oba,I know how difficult it is for members of Congress in both parties to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now.,9
2009-04-15,oba,I'd love if these problems were coming at us one at a time instead of five or six at a time.,5
2009-04-15,oba,It's more than most Congresses and most Presidents have to deal with in a lifetime.,5
2009-04-15,oba,But we have been called to govern in extraordinary times.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"And that requires an extraordinary sense of responsibility -- to ourselves, to the men and women who sent us here, to the many generations whose lives will be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here.",6
2009-04-15,oba,There is no doubt that times are still tough.,3
2009-04-15,oba,By no means are we out of the woods just yet.,4
2009-04-15,oba,"But from where we stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to see glimmers of hope.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"And beyond that, way off in the distance, we can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than our troubled economic past.",6
2009-04-15,oba,"It's an America teeming with new industry and commerce, humming with new energy and discoveries that light the world once more -- a place where anyone from anywhere with a good idea or the will to work can live the dream they've heard so much about.",12
2009-04-15,oba,"That is the house upon the rock -- proud, sturdy, unwavering in the face of the greatest storms.",9
2009-04-15,oba,And we will not finish it in one year.,3
2009-04-15,oba,We will not finish it in many.,2
2009-04-15,oba,"But if we use this moment to lay that new foundation, if we come together and begin the hard work of rebuilding, if we persist and persevere against the disappointments and setbacks that will surely lie ahead, then I have no doubt that this house will stand and the dream of our founders will live on in our time.",7
2009-04-15,oba,Thank you.,1
2009-04-15,oba,God bless you.,1
2009-04-15,oba,God bless the United States of America.,3
2009-05-22,oba,Let me just acknowledge the presence of some of my outstanding Cabinet members and advisors.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"We've got our Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.",3
2009-05-22,oba,We have our CIA Director Leon Panetta.,3
2009-05-22,oba,We have our Secretary of Defense William Gates; Secretary Napolitano of Department of Homeland Security; Attorney General Eric Holder; my National Security Advisor Jim Jones.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"And I want to especially thank our Acting Archivist of the United States, Adrienne Thomas.",5
2009-05-22,oba,I also want to acknowledge several members of the House who have great interest in intelligence matters.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"I want to thank Congressman Reyes, Congressman Hoekstra, Congressman King, as well as Congressman Thompson, for being here today.",5
2009-05-22,oba,Thank you so much.,2
2009-05-22,oba,These are extraordinary times for our country.,4
2009-05-22,oba,We're confronting a historic economic crisis.,2
2009-05-22,oba,We're fighting two wars.,2
2009-05-22,oba,We face a range of challenges that will define the way that Americans will live in the 21st century.,9
2009-05-22,oba,"So there's no shortage of work to be done, or responsibilities to bear.",4
2009-05-22,oba,And we've begun to make progress.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"Just this week, we've taken steps to protect American consumers and homeowners, and to reform our system of government contracting so that we better protect our people while spending our money more wisely.",7
2009-05-22,oba,The -- it's a good bill.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"The engines of our economy are slowly beginning to turn, and we're working towards historic reform on health care and on energy.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"I want to say to the members of Congress, I welcome all the extraordinary work that has been done over these last four months on these and other issues.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"In the midst of all these challenges, however, my single most important responsibility as President is to keep the American people safe.",5
2009-05-22,oba,It's the first thing that I think about when I wake up in the morning.,7
2009-05-22,oba,It's the last thing that I think about when I go to sleep at night.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"And this responsibility is only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our people, and technology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do us great harm.",5
2009-05-22,oba,We are less than eight years removed from the deadliest attack on American soil in our history.,6
2009-05-22,oba,We know that al Qaeda is actively planning to attack us again.,3
2009-05-22,oba,"We know that this threat will be with us for a long time, and that we must use all elements of our power to defeat it.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"Already, we've taken several steps to achieve that goal.",3
2009-05-22,oba,"For the first time since 2002, we're providing the necessary resources and strategic direction to take the fight to the extremists who attacked us on 9/11 in Afghanistan and Pakistan.",7
2009-05-22,oba,We're investing in the 21st century military and intelligence capabilities that will allow us to stay one step ahead of a nimble enemy.,8
2009-05-22,oba,We have re-energized a global non-proliferation regime to deny the world's most dangerous people access to the world's deadliest weapons.,7
2009-05-22,oba,And we've launched an effort to secure all loose nuclear materials within four years.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"We're better protecting our border, and increasing our preparedness for any future attack or natural disaster.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"We're building new partnerships around the world to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates.",4
2009-05-22,oba,And we have renewed American diplomacy so that we once again have the strength and standing to truly lead the world.,4
2009-05-22,oba,These steps are all critical to keeping America secure.,4
2009-05-22,oba,But I believe with every fiber of my being that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"The documents that we hold in this very hall -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights -- these are not simply words written into aging parchment.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"They are the foundation of liberty and justice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity around the world.",10
2009-05-22,oba,I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents.,6
2009-05-22,oba,My father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered.,6
2009-05-22,oba,My mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when I lived as a child in a foreign land.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"My own American journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words -- ""to form a more perfect union.""",8
2009-05-22,oba,"I've studied the Constitution as a student, I've taught it as a teacher, I've been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution as Commander-in-Chief, and as a citizen, I know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake.",8
2009-05-22,oba,I make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"We uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it keeps us safe.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"Time and again, our values have been our best national security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of upheaval.",5
2009-05-22,oba,Fidelity to our values is the reason why the United States of America grew from a small string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world.,11
2009-05-22,oba,"It's the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatment from America's Armed Forces than from their own government.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"It's the reason why America has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn a sharp, moral contrast with our adversaries.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"It's the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free peoples everywhere in the common cause and common effort of liberty.",12
2009-05-22,oba,"From Europe to the Pacific, we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law.",7
2009-05-22,oba,That is who we are.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"And where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, America must demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than a hateful ideology.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"After 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era -- that enemies who did not abide by any law of war would present new challenges to our application of the law; that our government would need new tools to protect the American people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply prosecuting those who try to carry them out.",9
2009-05-22,oba,"Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions.",4
2009-05-22,oba,I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people.,6
2009-05-22,oba,But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"Instead of strategically applying our power and our principles, too often we set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"And during this season of fear, too many of us -- Democrats and Republicans, politicians, journalists, and citizens -- fell silent.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"In other words, we went off course.",3
2009-05-22,oba,And this is not my assessment alone.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"It was an assessment that was shared by the American people who nominated candidates for President from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a new approach -- one that rejected torture and one that recognized the imperative of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.",21
2009-05-22,oba,Now let me be clear:  We are indeed at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates.,7
2009-05-22,oba,We do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat.,5
2009-05-22,oba,But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"For reasons that I will explain, the decisions that were made over the last eight years established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable -- a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions and time-tested institutions, and that failed to use our values as a compass.",9
2009-05-22,oba,And that's why I took several steps upon taking office to better protect the American people.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"First, I banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States of America.",5
2009-05-22,oba,I know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe.,4
2009-05-22,oba,I could not disagree more.,1
2009-05-22,oba,"As Commander-in-Chief, I see the intelligence.",4
2009-05-22,oba,I bear the responsibility for keeping this country safe.,5
2009-05-22,oba,And I categorically reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"What's more, they undermine the rule of law.",3
2009-05-22,oba,They alienate us in the world.,3
2009-05-22,oba,"They serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"They risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that Americans will be mistreated if they are captured.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"In short, they did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them, and that is why I ended them once and for all.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, I should add, the arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"As Senator McCain once said, torture ""serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us.""",8
2009-05-22,oba,"And even under President Bush, there was recognition among members of his own administration -- including a Secretary of State, other senior officials, and many in the military and intelligence community -- that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, and the wrong side of history.",7
2009-05-22,oba,That's why we must leave these methods where they belong -- in the past.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"They are not who we are, and they are not America.",2
2009-05-22,oba,The second decision that I made was to order the closing of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"For over seven years, we have detained hundreds of people at Guantanamo.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"During that time, the system of military commissions that were in place at Guantanamo succeeded in convicting a grand total of three suspected terrorists.",6
2009-05-22,oba,Let me repeat that:  three convictions in over seven years.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"Instead of bringing terrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setback after setback, cases lingered on, and in 2006 the Supreme Court invalidated the entire system.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"Meanwhile, over 525 detainees were released from Guantanamo under not my administration, under the previous administration.",5
2009-05-22,oba,Let me repeat that:  Two-thirds of the detainees were released before I took office and ordered the closure of Guantanamo.,7
2009-05-22,oba,There is also no question that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America's strongest currency in the world.,8
2009-05-22,oba,"Instead of building a durable framework for the struggle against al Qaeda that drew upon our deeply held values and traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the rule of law.",10
2009-05-22,oba,"In fact, part of the rationale for establishing Guantanamo in the first place was the misplaced notion that a prison there would be beyond the law -- a proposition that the Supreme Court soundly rejected.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"Meanwhile, instead of serving as a tool to counter terrorism, Guantanamo became a symbol that helped al Qaeda recruit terrorists to its cause.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"Indeed, the existence of Guantanamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"So the record is clear:  Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security.",5
2009-05-22,oba,It is a rallying cry for our enemies.,4
2009-05-22,oba,It sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries.,10
2009-05-22,oba,"By any measure, the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"That's why I argued that it should be closed throughout my campaign, and that is why I ordered it closed within one year.",6
2009-05-22,oba,The third decision that I made was to order a review of all pending cases at Guantanamo.,6
2009-05-22,oba,I knew when I ordered Guantanamo closed that it would be difficult and complex.,5
2009-05-22,oba,There are 240 people there who have now spent years in legal limbo.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"In dealing with this situation, we don't have the luxury of starting from scratch.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"We're cleaning up something that is, quite simply, a mess -- a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant, almost daily basis, and it consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our country.",10
2009-05-22,oba,"Indeed, the legal challenges that have sparked so much debate in recent weeks here in Washington would be taking place whether or not I decided to close Guantanamo.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"For example, the court order to release 17 Uighurs -- 17 Uighur detainees took place last fall, when George Bush was President.",4
2009-05-22,oba,The Supreme Court that invalidated the system of prosecution at Guantanamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed by Republican Presidents -- not wild-eyed liberals.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"In other words, the problem of what to do with Guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility; the problem exists because of the decision to open Guantanamo in the first place.",7
2009-05-22,oba,Now let me be blunt.,2
2009-05-22,oba,There are no neat or easy answers here.,3
2009-05-22,oba,I wish there were.,2
2009-05-22,oba,But I can tell you that the wrong answer is to pretend like this problem will go away if we maintain an unsustainable status quo.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"As President, I refuse to allow this problem to fester.",3
2009-05-22,oba,I refuse to pass it on to somebody else.,4
2009-05-22,oba,It is my responsibility to solve the problem.,4
2009-05-22,oba,Our security interests will not permit us to delay.,2
2009-05-22,oba,Our courts won't allow it.,2
2009-05-22,oba,And neither should our conscience.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, over the last several weeks, we've seen a return of the politicization of these issues that have characterized the last several years.",8
2009-05-22,oba,I'm an elected official; I understand these problems arouse passions and concerns.,3
2009-05-22,oba,They should.,1
2009-05-22,oba,We're confronting some of the most complicated questions that a democracy can face.,6
2009-05-22,oba,But I have no interest in spending all of our time relitigating the policies of the last eight years.,7
2009-05-22,oba,I'll leave that to others.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"I want to solve these problems, and I want to solve them together as Americans.",4
2009-05-22,oba,And we will be ill-served by some of the fear-mongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"Listening to the recent debate, I've heard words that, frankly, are calculated to scare people rather than educate them; words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"So I want to take this opportunity to lay out what we are doing, and how we intend to resolve these outstanding issues.",5
2009-05-22,oba,I will explain how each action that we are taking will help build a framework that protects both the American people and the values that we hold most dear.,9
2009-05-22,oba,"And I'll focus on two broad areas:  first, issues relating to Guantanamo and our detention policy; but, second, I also want to discuss issues relating to security and transparency.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, let me begin by disposing of one argument as plainly as I can:  We are not going to release anyone if it would endanger our national security, nor will we release detainees within the United States who endanger the American people.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders -- namely, highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety.",13
2009-05-22,oba,"As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following face:  Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal, supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists.",11
2009-05-22,oba,"As Republican Lindsey Graham said, the idea that we cannot find a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the United States is not rational.",9
2009-05-22,oba,We are currently in the process of reviewing each of the detainee cases at Guantanamo to determine the appropriate policy for dealing with them.,10
2009-05-22,oba,"And as we do so, we are acutely aware that under the last administration, detainees were released and, in some cases, returned to the battlefield.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"That's why we are doing away with the poorly planned, haphazard approach that let those detainees go in the past.",8
2009-05-22,oba,Instead we are treating these cases with the care and attention that the law requires and that our security demands.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, going forward, these cases will fall into five distinct categories.",3
2009-05-22,oba,"First, whenever feasible, we will try those who have violated American criminal laws in federal courts -- courts provided for by the United States Constitution.",7
2009-05-22,oba,Some have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trials of terrorists.,7
2009-05-22,oba,They are wrong.,1
2009-05-22,oba,"Our courts and our juries, our citizens, are tough enough to convict terrorists.",4
2009-05-22,oba,The record makes that clear.,2
2009-05-22,oba,Ramzi Yousef tried to blow up the World Trade Center.,3
2009-05-22,oba,He was convicted in our courts and is serving a life sentence in U.S. prisons.,5
2009-05-22,oba,Zacarias Moussaoui has been identified as the 20th 9/11 hijacker.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"He was convicted in our courts, and he too is serving a life sentence in prison.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"If we can try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons, then we can do the same with detainees from Guantanamo.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"Recently, we prosecuted and received a guilty plea from a detainee, al-Marri, in federal court after years of legal confusion.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"We're preparing to transfer another detainee to the Southern District Court of New York, where he will face trial on charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- bombings that killed over 200 people.",15
2009-05-22,oba,Preventing this detainee from coming to our shores would prevent his trial and conviction.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"And after over a decade, it is time to finally see that justice is served, and that is what we intend to do.",4
2009-05-22,oba,The second category of cases involves detainees who violate the laws of war and are therefore best tried through military commissions.,6
2009-05-22,oba,Military commissions have a history in the United States dating back to George Washington and the Revolutionary War.,7
2009-05-22,oba,They are an appropriate venue for trying detainees for violations of the laws of war.,9
2009-05-22,oba,They allow for the protection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering; they allow for the safety and security of participants; and for the presentation of evidence gathered from the battlefield that cannot always be effectively presented in federal courts.,9
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, some have suggested that this represents a reversal on my part.",5
2009-05-22,oba,They should look at the record.,3
2009-05-22,oba,"In 2006, I did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the Bush administration and passed by the Congress because it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework, with the kind of meaningful due process rights for the accused that could stand up on appeal.",9
2009-05-22,oba,"I said at that time, however, that I supported the use of military commissions to try detainees, provided there were several reforms, and in fact there were some bipartisan efforts to achieve those reforms.",6
2009-05-22,oba,Those are the reforms that we are now making.,3
2009-05-22,oba,"Instead of using the flawed commissions of the last seven years, my administration is bringing our commissions in line with the rule of law.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"We will no longer permit the use of evidence -- as evidence statements that have been obtained using cruel, inhuman, or degrading interrogation methods.",8
2009-05-22,oba,We will no longer place the burden to prove that hearsay is unreliable on the opponent of the hearsay.,8
2009-05-22,oba,"And we will give detainees greater latitude in selecting their own counsel, and more protections if they refuse to testify.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"These reforms, among others, will make our military commissions a more credible and effective means of administering justice, and I will work with Congress and members of both parties, as well as legal authorities across the political spectrum, on legislation to ensure that these commissions are fair, legitimate, and effective.",7
2009-05-22,oba,The third category of detainees includes those who have been ordered released by the courts.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, let me repeat what I said earlier:  This has nothing to do with my decision to close Guantanamo.",7
2009-05-22,oba,It has to do with the rule of law.,5
2009-05-22,oba,The courts have spoken.,2
2009-05-22,oba,They have found that there's no legitimate reason to hold 21 of the people currently held at Guantanamo.,9
2009-05-22,oba,Nineteen of these findings took place before I was sworn into office.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"I cannot ignore these rulings because as President, I too am bound by the law.",4
2009-05-22,oba,The United States is a nation of laws and so we must abide by these rulings.,4
2009-05-22,oba,The fourth category of cases involves detainees who we have determined can be transferred safely to another country.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"So far, our review team has approved 50 detainees for transfer.",3
2009-05-22,oba,And my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation.,11
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, finally, there remains the question of detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the American people.",7
2009-05-22,oba,And I have to be honest here -- this is the toughest single issue that we will face.,3
2009-05-22,oba,We're going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at Guantanamo who pose a danger to our country.,10
2009-05-22,oba,"But even when this process is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"Examples of that threat include people who've received extensive explosives training at al Qaeda training camps, or commanded Taliban troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States.",7
2009-05-22,oba,Let me repeat:  I am not going to release individuals who endanger the American people.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"Al Qaeda terrorists and their affiliates are at war with the United States, and those that we capture -- like other prisoners of war -- must be prevented from attacking us again.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"Having said that, we must recognize that these detention policies cannot be unbounded.",3
2009-05-22,oba,They can't be based simply on what I or the executive branch decide alone.,5
2009-05-22,oba,That's why my administration has begun to reshape the standards that apply to ensure that they are in line with the rule of law.,12
2009-05-22,oba,"We must have clear, defensible, and lawful standards for those who fall into this category.",7
2009-05-22,oba,We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"We must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified.",4
2009-05-22,oba,I know that creating such a system poses unique challenges.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"And other countries have grappled with this question; now, so must we.",4
2009-05-22,oba,But I want to be very clear that our goal is to construct a legitimate legal framework for the remaining Guantanamo detainees that cannot be transferred.,8
2009-05-22,oba,Our goal is not to avoid a legitimate legal framework.,3
2009-05-22,oba,"In our constitutional system, prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"And so, going forward, my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our Constitution.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, as our efforts to close Guantanamo move forward, I know that the politics in Congress will be difficult.",4
2009-05-22,oba,These are issues that are fodder for 30-second commercials.,7
2009-05-22,oba,You can almost picture the direct mail pieces that emerge from any vote on this issue -- designed to frighten the population.,7
2009-05-22,oba,I get it.,1
2009-05-22,oba,"But if we continue to make decisions within a climate of fear, we will make more mistakes.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"And if we refuse to deal with these issues today, then I guarantee you that they will be an albatross around our efforts to combat terrorism in the future.",8
2009-05-22,oba,I have confidence that the American people are more interested in doing what is right to protect this country than in political posturing.,11
2009-05-22,oba,I am not the only person in this city who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution -- so did each and every member of Congress.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"And together we have a responsibility to enlist our values in the effort to secure our people, and to leave behind the legacy that makes it easier for future Presidents to keep this country safe.",10
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, let me touch on a second set of issues that relate to security and transparency.",9
2009-05-22,oba,National security requires a delicate balance.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"One the one hand, our democracy depends on transparency.",2
2009-05-22,oba,"On the other hand, some information must be protected from public disclosure for the sake of our security -- for instance, the movement of our troops, our intelligence-gathering, or the information we have about a terrorist organization and its affiliates.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"In these and other cases, lives are at stake.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, several weeks ago, as part of an ongoing court case, I released memos issued by the previous administration's Office of Legal Counsel.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"I did not do this because I disagreed with the enhanced interrogation techniques that those memos authorized, and I didn't release the documents because I rejected their legal rationales -- although I do on both counts.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"I released the memos because the existence of that approach to interrogation was already widely known, the Bush administration had acknowledged its existence, and I had already banned those methods.",8
2009-05-22,oba,The argument that somehow by releasing those memos we are providing terrorists with information about how they will be interrogated makes no sense.,7
2009-05-22,oba,We will not be interrogating terrorists using that approach.,4
2009-05-22,oba,That approach is now prohibited.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"In short, I released these memos because there was no overriding reason to protect them.",4
2009-05-22,oba,And the ensuing debate has helped the American people better understand how these interrogation methods came to be authorized and used.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"On the other hand, I recently opposed the release of certain photographs that were taken of detainees by U.S. personnel between 2002 and 2004.",9
2009-05-22,oba,Individuals who violated standards of behavior in these photos have been investigated and they have been held accountable.,5
2009-05-22,oba,There was and is no debate as to whether what is reflected in those photos is wrong.,9
2009-05-22,oba,Nothing has been concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"However, it was my judgment -- informed by my national security team -- that releasing these photos would inflame anti-American opinion and allow our enemies to paint U.S. troops with a broad, damning, and inaccurate brush, thereby endangering them in theaters of war.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"In short, there is a clear and compelling reason to not release these particular photos.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"There are nearly 200,000 Americans who are serving in harm's way, and I have a solemn responsibility for their safety as Commander-in-Chief.",8
2009-05-22,oba,Nothing would be gained by the release of these photos that matters more than the lives of our young men and women serving in harm's way.,15
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, in the press's mind and in some of the public's mind, these two cases are contradictory.",7
2009-05-22,oba,They are not to me.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"In each of these cases, I had to strike the right balance between transparency and national security.",6
2009-05-22,oba,And this balance brings with it a precious responsibility.,2
2009-05-22,oba,There's no doubt that the American people have seen this balance tested over the last several years.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"In the images from Abu Ghraib and the brutal interrogation techniques made public long before I was President, the American people learned of actions taken in their name that bear no resemblance to the ideals that generations of Americans have fought for.",10
2009-05-22,oba,"And whether it was the run-up to the Iraq war or the revelation of secret programs, Americans often felt like part of the story had been unnecessarily withheld from them.",6
2009-05-22,oba,And that caused suspicion to build up.,3
2009-05-22,oba,And that leads to a thirst for accountability.,4
2009-05-22,oba,I understand that.,1
2009-05-22,oba,"I ran for President promising transparency, and I meant what I said.",3
2009-05-22,oba,"And that's why, whenever possible, my administration will make all information available to the American people so that they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable.",5
2009-05-22,oba,But I have never argued -- and I never will -- that our most sensitive national security matters should simply be an open book.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"I will never abandon -- and will vigorously defend -- the necessity of classification to defend our troops at war, to protect sources and methods, and to safeguard confidential actions that keep the American people safe.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"Here's the difference though:  Whenever we cannot release certain information to the public for valid national security reasons, I will insist that there is oversight of my actions -- by Congress or by the courts.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"We're currently launching a review of current policies by all those agencies responsible for the classification of documents to determine where reforms are possible, and to assure that the other branches of government will be in a position to review executive branch decisions on these matters.",9
2009-05-22,oba,"Because in our system of checks and balances, someone must always watch over the watchers -- especially when it comes to sensitive administration -- information.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, along these same lines, my administration is also confronting challenges to what is known as the ""state secrets"" privilege.",7
2009-05-22,oba,This is a doctrine that allows the government to challenge legal cases involving secret programs.,7
2009-05-22,oba,It's been used by many past Presidents -- Republican and Democrat -- for many decades.,4
2009-05-22,oba,"And while this principle is absolutely necessary in some circumstances to protect national security, I am concerned that it has been over-used.",4
2009-05-22,oba,It is also currently the subject of a wide range of lawsuits.,5
2009-05-22,oba,So let me lay out some principles here.,3
2009-05-22,oba,We must not protect information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government.,7
2009-05-22,oba,And that's why my administration is nearing completion of a thorough review of this practice.,7
2009-05-22,oba,And we plan to embrace several principles for reform.,3
2009-05-22,oba,We will apply a stricter legal test to material that can be protected under the state secrets privilege.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"We will not assert the privilege in court without first following our own formal process, including review by a Justice Department committee and the personal approval of the Attorney General.",11
2009-05-22,oba,"And each year we will voluntarily report to Congress when we have invoked the privilege and why because, as I said before, there must be proper oversight over our actions.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"On all these matters related to the disclosure of sensitive information, I wish I could say that there was some simple formula out there to be had.",8
2009-05-22,oba,There is not.,1
2009-05-22,oba,"These often involve tough calls, involve competing concerns, and they require a surgical approach.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"But the common thread that runs through all of my decisions is simple:  We will safeguard what we must to protect the American people, but we will also ensure the accountability and oversight that is the hallmark of our constitutional system.",8
2009-05-22,oba,I will never hide the truth because it's uncomfortable.,2
2009-05-22,oba,I will deal with Congress and the courts as co-equal branches of government.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"I will tell the American people what I know and don't know, and when I release something publicly or keep something secret, I will tell you why.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, in all the areas that I've discussed today, the policies that I've proposed represent a new direction from the last eight years.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"To protect the American people and our values, we've banned enhanced interrogation techniques.",4
2009-05-22,oba,We are closing the prison at Guantanamo.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"We are reforming military commissions, and we will pursue a new legal regime to detain terrorists.",3
2009-05-22,oba,"We are declassifying more information and embracing more oversight of our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state secrets privilege.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"These are dramatic changes that will put our approach to national security on a surer, safer, and more sustainable footing.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"Their implementation will take time, but they will get done.",2
2009-05-22,oba,There's a core principle that we will apply to all of our actions.,7
2009-05-22,oba,"Even as we clean up the mess at Guantanamo, we will constantly reevaluate our approach, subject our decisions to review from other branches of government, as well as the public.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"We seek the strongest and most sustainable legal framework for addressing these issues in the long term -- not to serve immediate politics, but to do what's right over the long term.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"By doing that we can leave behind a legacy that outlasts my administration, my presidency, that endures for the next President and the President after that -- a legacy that protects the American people and enjoys a broad legitimacy at home and abroad.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"Now, this is what I mean when I say that we need to focus on the future.",6
2009-05-22,oba,I recognize that many still have a strong desire to focus on the past.,6
2009-05-22,oba,"When it comes to actions of the last eight years, passions are high.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"Some Americans are angry; others want to re-fight debates that have been settled, in some cases debates that they have lost.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"I know that these debates lead directly, in some cases, to a call for a fuller accounting, perhaps through an independent commission.",6
2009-05-22,oba,I've opposed the creation of such a commission because I believe that our existing democratic institutions are strong enough to deliver accountability.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"The Congress can review abuses of our values, and there are ongoing inquiries by the Congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques.",7
2009-05-22,oba,The Department of Justice and our courts can work through and punish any violations of our laws or miscarriages of justice.,6
2009-05-22,oba,It's no secret there is a tendency in Washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another.,7
2009-05-22,oba,And it's no secret that our media culture feeds the impulse that lead to a good fight and good copy.,8
2009-05-22,oba,But nothing will contribute more than that than a extended relitigation of the last eight years.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"Already, we've seen how that kind of effort only leads those in Washington to different sides to laying blame.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"It can distract us from focusing our time, our efforts, and our politics on the challenges of the future.",7
2009-05-22,oba,"We see that, above all, in the recent debate -- how the recent debate has obscured the truth and sends people into opposite and absolutist ends.",6
2009-05-22,oba,"On the one side of the spectrum, there are those who make little allowance for the unique challenges posed by terrorism, and would almost never put national security over transparency.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"And on the other end of the spectrum, there are those who embrace a view that can be summarized in two words:  ""Anything goes.""",8
2009-05-22,oba,"Their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting terrorism can be used to justify any means, and that the President should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants -- provided it is a President with whom they agree.",8
2009-05-22,oba,"Both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"The American people are not absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"They know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense.",9
2009-05-22,oba,"That, after all, is the unique genius of America.",3
2009-05-22,oba,That's the challenge laid down by our Constitution.,5
2009-05-22,oba,That has been the source of our strength through the ages.,4
2009-05-22,oba,That's what makes the United States of America different as a nation.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"I can stand here today, as President of the United States, and say without exception or equivocation that we do not torture, and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law.",11
2009-05-22,oba,"Make no mistake:  If we fail to turn the page on the approach that was taken over the past several years, then I will not be able to say that as President.",9
2009-05-22,oba,"And if we cannot stand for our core values, then we are not keeping faith with the documents that are enshrined in this hall.",7
2009-05-22,oba,The Framers who drafted the Constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded over the last 222 years.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"But our Constitution has endured through secession and civil rights, through World War and Cold War, because it provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically; it provides a compass that can help us find our way.",5
2009-05-22,oba,It hasn't always been easy.,1
2009-05-22,oba,We are an imperfect people.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"Every now and then, there are those who think that America's safety and success requires us to walk away from the sacred principles enshrined in this building.",11
2009-05-22,oba,And we hear such voices today.,2
2009-05-22,oba,But over the long haul the American people have resisted that temptation.,3
2009-05-22,oba,"And though we've made our share of mistakes, required some course corrections, ultimately we have held fast to the principles that have been the source of our strength and a beacon to the world.",10
2009-05-22,oba,Now this generation faces a great test in the specter of terrorism.,5
2009-05-22,oba,"And unlike the Civil War or World War II, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.",4
2009-05-22,oba,"Right now, in distant training camps and in crowded cities, there are people plotting to take American lives.",5
2009-05-22,oba,"That will be the case a year from now, five years from now, and -- in all probability -- 10 years from now.",4
2009-05-22,oba,Neither I nor anyone can stand here today and say that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes American lives.,6
2009-05-22,oba,But I can say with certainty that my administration -- along with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and women who defend our national security -- will do everything in our power to keep the American people safe.,9
2009-05-22,oba,And I do know with certainty that we can defeat al Qaeda.,3
2009-05-22,oba,"Because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their ranks and alienate America from our allies, and they will never be able to do that if we stay true to who we are, if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless ideals.",10
2009-05-22,oba,This must be our common purpose.,2
2009-05-22,oba,I ran for President because I believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together.,6
2009-05-22,oba,We will not be safe if we see national security as a wedge that divides America -- it can and must be a cause that unites us as one people and as one nation.,7
2009-05-22,oba,We've done so before in times that were more perilous than ours.,4
2009-05-22,oba,We will do so once again.,2
2009-05-22,oba,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",5
2009-06-15,oba,"Good afternoon, everybody.",2
2009-06-15,oba,"Today I want to start by addressing three issues, and then I'll take your questions.",5
2009-06-15,oba,"First, I'd like to say a few words about the situation in Iran.",6
2009-06-15,oba,"The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings, and imprisonments of the last few days.",8
2009-06-15,oba,"I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost.",7
2009-06-15,oba,"I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and is not interfering with Iran's affairs.",7
2009-06-15,oba,"But we must also bear witness to the courage and the dignity of the Iranian people, and to a remarkable opening within Iranian society.",6
2009-06-15,oba,And we deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place.,4
2009-06-15,oba,The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future.,5
2009-06-15,oba,"Some in Iran -- Some in the Iranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the United States and others in the West of instigating protests over the election.",9
2009-06-15,oba,These accusations are patently false.,2
2009-06-15,oba,They're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking place within Iran's borders.,8
2009-06-15,oba,This tired strategy of using old tensions to scapegoat other countries won't work anymore in Iran.,7
2009-06-15,oba,"This is not about the United States or the West; this is about the people of Iran, and the future that they -- and only they -- will choose.",5
2009-06-15,oba,The Iranian people can speak for themselves.,2
2009-06-15,oba,That's precisely what's happened in the last few days.,4
2009-06-15,oba,"In 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to peaceful protests of justice.",8
2009-06-15,oba,"Despite the Iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolate itself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phones and computers, and so we've watched what the Iranian people are doing.",4
2009-06-15,oba,This is what we've witnessed.,2
2009-06-15,oba,We've seen the timeless dignity of tens of thousands of Iranians marching in silence.,6
2009-06-15,oba,We've seen people of all ages risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that their voices are heard.,6
2009-06-15,oba,"Above all, we've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality and threats, and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets.",8
2009-06-15,oba,"While this loss is raw and extraordinarily painful, we also know this: Those who stand up for justice are always on the right side of history.",5
2009-06-15,oba,"As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.",4
2009-06-15,oba,The Iranian people have a universal right to assembly and free speech.,5
2009-06-15,oba,"If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect those rights and heed the will of its own people.",5
2009-06-15,oba,It must govern through consent and not coercion.,4
2009-06-15,oba,"That's what Iran's own people are calling for, and the Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government.",5
2009-07-15,oba,"

Hello, Michigan!",1

2009-07-15,oba,So he's the point person on it.,3
2009-07-15,oba,The only reason he's not here is because he is working alongside the administration to get this bill done.,5
2009-07-15,oba,Please give him a big round of applause.,3
2009-07-15,oba,"Congressman Sandy Levin, also working hard on your behalf each and every day, but is not here today.",5

2009-07-15,oba,My game is a little like Dave Bing's -- except I don't have the jump shot or the speed or the ball handling skills -- or the endurance.,5
2009-07-15,oba,Also don't have the afro.,2
2009-07-15,oba,"Don't think I forgot that, Dave.",3
2009-07-15,oba,I remember.,1

2009-07-15,oba,"He earned his associate degree here at Macomb, and with a pretty impressive GPA, I might add.",5

2009-07-15,oba,"Here in Michigan, it's about five points higher.",4

2009-07-15,oba,I want the responsibility.,2
2009-07-15,oba,And I know that -- let's just take an example.,3
2009-07-15,oba,Many questioned our efforts to help save GM and Chrysler from collapse earlier this year.,5
2009-07-15,oba,"Their feeling was these companies were driven to the brink by poor management decisions over a long period of time, and like any business they should be held accountable for those decisions.",6
2009-07-15,oba,I agree that they should be held accountable.,2
2009-07-15,oba,But I also recognize the historic significance and economic prominence of these companies in communities all across Michigan and all across the country.,7
2009-07-15,oba,"I thought about the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose livelihoods are still connected to the American auto industry, and the impact on an already struggling economy, especially right here in Michigan.",8
2009-07-15,oba,"So I said that if Chrysler and GM were willing to fundamentally restructure their businesses and make the hard choices necessary to become competitive now and in the future, it was a process worth supporting.",8
2009-07-15,oba,"Now today, after a painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice, both GM and Chrysler have emerged from bankruptcy.",5
2009-07-15,oba,"Remember, folks said there was no way they could do it?",4
2009-07-15,oba,"They've gotten it done already, in record time -- far faster than anybody thought possible.",4
2009-07-15,oba,"They've got a leaner structure, they've got new management, and a viable vision of how to compete and win in the 21st century.",7
2009-07-15,oba,Those sacrifices were shared among all the stakeholders:  workers and management; creditors and shareholders; retirees and communities.,6
2009-07-15,oba,"And together, they've made the rebirth of Chrysler and GM possible.",5
2009-07-15,oba,It was the right thing to do.,3
2009-07-15,oba,"But even with this positive news, the hard truth is, is that some of the jobs that have been lost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back.",7
2009-07-15,oba,They're the casualties of a changing economy.,4
2009-07-15,oba,"In some cases, just increased productivity in the plants themselves means that some jobs aren't going to return.",5
2009-07-15,oba,"And that only underscores the importance of generating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones that we've lost, and of preparing our workers to fill the jobs they create.",7
2009-07-15,oba,"For even before this recession hit, we were faced with an economy that was simply not creating or sustaining enough new, well-paying jobs.",7
2009-07-15,oba,So now is the time to change all that.,4
2009-07-15,oba,What we face is far more than a passing crisis.,4
2009-07-15,oba,This is a transformative moment.,2
2009-07-15,oba,And in this moment we must do what other generations have done.,3
2009-07-15,oba,It's not the time to shrink from the challenges we face or put off tough decisions.,8
2009-07-15,oba,"That's what Washington has done for decades, and it's exactly why I ran for President -- to change that mindset.",5

2009-07-15,oba,"To build that foundation, we have to slow the growth of health care costs that are driving us into debt.",6
2009-07-15,oba,"We're going to have to do that, and there's going to be a major debate over the next three weeks.",6
2009-07-15,oba,"And don't be fooled by folks trying to scare you, saying we can't change the health care system.",5
2009-07-15,oba,"We have no choice but to change the health care system, because right now it's broken for too many Americans.",6
2009-07-15,oba,We're going to have to make tough choices necessary to bring down deficits.,5
2009-07-15,oba,"But don't let folks fool you -- the best way to start bringing down deficits is to get control of our health care costs, which is why we need reform.",8
2009-07-15,oba,"Now is the time to create the jobs of the future by growing industries, including a new clean energy economy.",7

2009-07-15,oba,So you can be all on top of weatherizing.,4
2009-07-15,oba,You need to weatherize.,2
2009-07-15,oba,I know about that in Chicago too.,4
2009-07-15,oba,But we also have to ensure that we're educating and preparing our people for the new jobs of the 21st century.,8
2009-07-15,oba,We've got to prepare our people with the skills they need to compete in this global economy.,8
2009-07-15,oba,"Time and again, when we placed our bet for the future on education, we have prospered as a result -- by tapping the incredible innovative and generative potential of a skilled American workforce.",6
2009-07-15,oba,"That's what happened when President Lincoln signed into law legislation creating the land grant colleges, which not only transformed higher education, but also our entire economy.",9
2009-07-15,oba,"That's what took place when President Roosevelt signed the GI Bill which helped educate a generation, and ushered in an era of unprecedented prosperity.",6
2009-07-15,oba,That was the foundation for the American middle class.,4
2009-07-15,oba,"And that's why, at the start of my administration I set a goal for America:  By 2020, this nation will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.",7
2009-07-15,oba,We used to have that.,2
2009-07-15,oba,We're going to have it again.,2
2009-07-15,oba,And we've begun to take historic steps to achieve this goal.,4
2009-07-15,oba,Already we've increased Pell grants by $500.,3
2009-07-15,oba,"We've created a $2,500 tax credit for four years of college tuition.",5
2009-07-15,oba,We've simplified student aid applications and ensured that aid is not based on the income of a job that you just lost.,8
2009-07-15,oba,A new GI Bill of Rights for the 21st century is beginning to help soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan to begin a new life -- in a new economy.,5
2009-07-15,oba,And the recovery plan has helped close state budget shortfalls -- which put enormous pressure on public universities and community colleges -- at the same time making historic investments in school libraries and classrooms and facilities all across America.,8
2009-07-15,oba,"So we've already taken some steps that are building the foundation for a 21st century education system here in America, one that will allow us to compete with China and India and everybody else all around the world.",13
2009-07-15,oba,But today I'm announcing the most significant down payment yet on reaching the goal of having the highest college graduation rate of any nation in the world.,11
2009-07-15,oba,We're going to achieve this in the next 10 years.,4
2009-07-15,oba,And it's called the American Graduation Initiative.,2
2009-07-15,oba,It will reform and strengthen community colleges like this one from coast to coast so they get the resources that students and schools need -- and the results workers and businesses demand.,6
2009-07-15,oba,"Through this plan, we seek to help an additional 5 million Americans earn degrees and certificates in the next decade -- 5 million.",5
2009-07-15,oba,Not since the passage of the original GI Bill and the work of President Truman's Commission on Higher Education -- which helped to double the number of community colleges and increase by seven-fold enrollment in those colleges -- have we taken such a historic step on behalf of community colleges in America.,10
2009-07-15,oba,And let me be clear:  We pay for this plan -- this isn't adding to the deficit; we're paying for this plan -- by ending the wasteful subsidies we currently provide to banks and private lenders for student loans.,10
2009-07-15,oba,That will save tens of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.,3
2009-07-15,oba,"Instead of lining the pockets of special interests, it's time this money went towards the interests of higher education in America.",8
2009-07-15,oba,That's what my administration is committed to doing.,4
2009-07-15,oba,"Now, I know that for a long time there have been politicians who have spoken of training as a silver bullet and college as a cure-all.",8
2009-07-15,oba,"It's not, and we know that.",2
2009-07-15,oba,"I can't tell you how many workers who've been laid off, you talk to them about training and they say, ""Training for what?""",5
2009-07-15,oba,"So I understand the frustrations that a lot of people have, especially if the training is not well designed for the specific jobs that are being created out there.",6
2009-07-15,oba,"But we know that in the coming years, jobs requiring at least an associate degree are projected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college experience.",8
2009-07-15,oba,We will not fill those jobs -- or even keep those jobs here in America -- without the training offered by community colleges.,7
2009-07-15,oba,That's why I want to applaud Governor Granholm for the No Worker Left Behind program.,7
2009-07-15,oba,It's providing up to two years' worth of free tuition at community colleges and universities across the state.,8
2009-07-15,oba,The rest of the country should learn from the effort.,4
2009-07-15,oba,"This is training to become a medical technician, or a health IT worker, or a lab specialist, or a nurse.",6
2009-07-15,oba,"In fact, 59 percent of all new nurses come from community colleges.",4
2009-07-15,oba,This is training to install solar panels and build those wind turbines we were talking about and develop a smarter electricity grid.,7
2009-07-15,oba,And this is the kind of education that more and more Americans are using to improve their skills and broaden their horizons.,6
2009-07-15,oba,Many young people are saving money by spending two years at community college before heading to a four-year college.,8
2009-07-15,oba,And more workers who have lost their jobs -- or fear losing a job -- are seeking an edge at schools like this one.,6
2009-07-15,oba,"At the same time, community colleges are under increasing pressure to cap enrollments and scrap courses and cut costs as states and municipalities face budget shortfalls.",7
2009-07-15,oba,"And this is in addition to the challenges you face in the best of times, as these schools receive far less funding per student than typical four-year colleges and universities.",9
2009-07-15,oba,So community colleges are an undervalued asset in our country.,4
2009-07-15,oba,"Not only is that not right, it's not smart.",3
2009-07-15,oba,"That's why I've asked Dr. Jill Biden -- who happens to be a relation of the Vice President, Joe Biden, but who is also a community college educator for more than 16 years -- to promote community colleges and help us make community colleges stronger.",8
2009-07-15,oba,And that's why we're putting in place this American Graduation Initiative.,3
2009-07-15,oba,Let me describe for you the specifics of what we're going to do.,6
2009-07-15,oba,"Number one, we will offer competitive grants, challenging community colleges to pursue innovative, results-oriented strategies in exchange for federal funding.",7
2009-07-15,oba,We'll fund programs that connect students looking for jobs with businesses that are looking to hire.,11
2009-07-15,oba,"We'll challenge these schools to find new and better ways to help students catch up on the basics, like math and science, that are essential to our competitiveness.",8
2009-07-15,oba,We'll put colleges and employers together to create programs that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom.,10
2009-07-15,oba,These are all kinds of -- there are all kinds of examples of what's possible.,6
2009-07-15,oba,"We've seen Cisco, for example, working with community colleges to prepare students and workers for jobs ranging from work in broadband to health IT.",8
2009-07-15,oba,We know that the most successful community colleges are those that partner with the private sector.,6
2009-07-15,oba,So we want to encourage more companies to work with schools to build these type of relationships.,6
2009-07-15,oba,"That way, when somebody goes through a training program, they know that there's a job at the end of that training.",7
2009-07-15,oba,We'll also create a new research center with a simple mission:  to measure what works and what doesn't.,5
2009-07-15,oba,"All too often, we don't know what happens when somebody walks out of a classroom and onto the factory floor or into the library or -- the laboratory or the office.",6
2009-07-15,oba,And that means businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth.,5
2009-07-15,oba,And schools themselves don't have the facts to make informed choices about which programs receive -- achieve results and which programs don't.,6
2009-07-15,oba,"And this is important, not just for businesses and colleges, but for students and workers, as well.",4
2009-07-15,oba,If a parent is going to spend time in the classroom and away from his or her family -- especially after a long day at work -- that degree really has to mean something.,7
2009-07-15,oba,"They have to know that when they get that degree, this is going to help advance their goals.",6
2009-07-15,oba,"If a worker is going to spend two years training to enter into a whole new profession, that certificate has to mean that he or she is ready, and that businesses are ready to hire.",7
2009-07-15,oba,"In addition, we want to propose new funding for innovative strategies that promote not just enrollment in a community college program, but completion of that program.",9
2009-07-15,oba,"See, more than half -- more than half of all students who enter community college to earn an associate degree, or transfer to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail to reach their goal.",9
2009-07-15,oba,"That's not just a waste of a valuable resource, that's a tragedy for these students.",5
2009-07-15,oba,"Oftentimes they've taken out debt and they don't get the degree, but they still have to pay back the debt.",4
2009-07-15,oba,And it's a disaster for our economy.,4
2009-07-15,oba,So we'll fund programs that track student progress inside and outside the classroom.,6
2009-07-15,oba,"Let's figure out what's keeping students from crossing that finish line, and then put in place reforms that will remove those barriers.",6
2009-07-15,oba,"Maybe it becomes too difficult for a parent to be away from home, or too expensive for a waiter or a nurse to miss a shift.",6
2009-07-15,oba,Maybe a young student just isn't sure if her education will lead to employment.,3
2009-07-15,oba,"The point is, we need to figure out solutions for these kinds of challenges -- because facing these impediments shouldn't prevent you from reaching your potential.",7
2009-07-15,oba,"All right, so that's a big chunk of this first part of this initiative.",6
2009-07-15,oba,The second part:  We're going to back $10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild college classrooms and buildings all across the country.,8
2009-07-15,oba,"All too often, community colleges are treated like the stepchild of the higher education system; they're an afterthought, if they're thought of at all.",7
2009-07-15,oba,"And that means schools are often years behind in the facilities they provide, which means, in a 21st century economy, they're years behind in the education they can offer.",8
2009-07-15,oba,That's a mistake and it's one that we'll help to correct.,5
2009-07-15,oba,"Through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a more affordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on the funds in the recovery plan that are already helping to renovate schools, including community colleges all across the country.",13
2009-07-15,oba,"And by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training that they're providing, guess what?",5
2009-07-15,oba,You also have to hire some workers and some tradesmen and women to do the work on those schools.,6
2009-07-15,oba,So it means it's putting people to work in Michigan right here right now.,4
2009-07-15,oba,"Number three:  Even as we repair bricks and mortar, we have an opportunity to build a new virtual infrastructure to complement the education and training community colleges can offer.",6
2009-07-15,oba,"So we're going to support the creation of a new online, open-source clearinghouse of courses so that community colleges across the country can offer more classes without building more classrooms.",6
2009-07-15,oba,And this will make a big difference especially for rural campuses that a lot of times have struggled -- attract -- have to struggle to attract students and faculty.,8
2009-07-15,oba,"And this will make it possible for a professor to complement his lecture with an online exercise, or for a student who can't be away from her family to still keep up with her coursework.",9
2009-07-15,oba,"We don't know where this kind of experiment will lead, but that's exactly why we ought to try it because I think there's a possibility that online education can provide especially for people who are already in the workforce and want to retrain the chance to upgrade their skills without having to quit their job.",17
2009-07-15,oba,"So let me say this more:  The road to recovery, the road to prosperity, is going to be hard.",4
2009-07-15,oba,It was never going to be easy.,2
2009-07-15,oba,"When I was sworn in, we were seeing 700 jobs lost that month.",3
2009-07-15,oba,Then we had the same amount lost for two more consecutive months.,5
2009-07-15,oba,"Now we've got an average of about 400,000 jobs lost -- but we're still losing too many jobs.",5
2009-07-15,oba,"We will get to the point where we're not losing jobs, but then we've got to start getting to the point where we're actually creating jobs.",7
2009-07-15,oba,And it's going to take time.,2
2009-07-15,oba,There are going to be false starts and there are going to be setbacks.,3
2009-07-15,oba,"But I am confident that we can meet the challenges we face, because that's what we've always done.",5
2009-07-15,oba,That's what America does.,2
2009-07-15,oba,"We hit some challenges, we fuss and argue about it, and then we go ahead and go about the business of solving our problems.",8
2009-07-15,oba,That's what we see on display right here at Macomb Community College.,4
2009-07-15,oba,That's what I've seen at colleges and universities all across this country.,6
2009-07-15,oba,"At every juncture in our history when we've been challenged, we have summoned the resilience and the industriousness -- that can-do American spirit -- that has allowed us to succeed in the face of even the toughest odds.",7
2009-07-15,oba,"That's what we can and must do now, not just to overcome this crisis, but to leave something better behind, to lay a foundation on which our children and our grandchildren can prosper and take responsibility for their future -- just as the students at this school, at this difficult moment, are taking responsibility for theirs.",11
2009-07-15,oba,"I am absolutely confident that if I've got your help, that we can make it happen, and we are going to see a stronger, more prosperous Michigan in the years to come.",5
2009-07-15,oba,"Thank you very much, Warren.",2
2009-07-15,oba,God bless you.,1
2009-07-15,oba,God bless the United States of America.,3
2009-09-24,oba,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen:

It is my honor to address you for the first time as the 44th President of the United States.",8
2009-09-24,oba,"I -- I come before you humbled by the responsibility that the American people have placed upon me, mindful of the enormous challenges of our moment in history, and determined to act boldly and collectively on behalf of justice and prosperity at home and abroad.",1
2009-09-24,oba,I have been in office for just nine months -- though some days it seems a lot longer.,4
2009-09-24,oba,I am well aware of the expectations that accompany my presidency around the world.,8
2009-09-24,oba,These expectations are not about me.,2
2009-09-24,oba,"Rather, they are rooted, I believe, in a discontent with a status quo that has allowed us to be increasingly defined by our differences, and outpaced by our problems.",9
2009-09-24,oba,"But they are also rooted in hope -- the hope that real change is possible, and the hope that America will be a leader in bringing about such change.",8
2009-09-24,oba,I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust.,7
2009-09-24,oba,Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country.,7
2009-09-24,oba,"Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others.",8
2009-09-24,oba,"And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.",7

2009-09-24,oba,Some of our actions have yielded progress.,4
2009-09-24,oba,Some have laid the groundwork for progress in the future.,3
2009-09-24,oba,But make no mistake:  This cannot solely be America's endeavor.,4
2009-09-24,oba,Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone.,8
2009-09-24,oba,We have sought -- in word and deed -- a new era of engagement with the world.,6
2009-09-24,oba,And now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges.,10
2009-09-24,oba,"Now, if we are honest with ourselves, we need to admit that we are not living up to that responsibility.",6
2009-09-24,oba,Consider the course that we're on if we fail to confront the status quo:  Extremists sowing terror in pockets of the world; protracted conflicts that grind on and on; genocide; mass atrocities; more nations with nuclear weapons; melting ice caps and ravaged populations; persistent poverty and pandemic disease.,11

2009-09-24,oba,"Those words ring even more true today, when it is not simply peace, but our very health and prosperity that we hold in common.",4
2009-09-24,oba,Yet we also know that this body is made up of sovereign states.,4
2009-09-24,oba,"And sadly, but not surprisingly, this body has often become a forum for sowing discord instead of forging common ground; a venue for playing politics and exploiting grievances rather than solving problems.",5
2009-09-24,oba,"After all, it is easy to walk up to this podium and point figures -- point fingers and stoke divisions.",4
2009-09-24,oba,"Nothing is easier than blaming others for our troubles, and absolving ourselves of responsibility for our choices and our actions.",10

2009-09-24,oba,"We can be remembered as a generation that chose to drag the arguments of the 20th century into the 21st; that put off hard choices, refused to look ahead, failed to keep pace because we defined ourselves by what we were against instead of what we were for.",10

2009-09-24,oba,That is the bargain that makes this work.,4
2009-09-24,oba,That must be the guiding principle of international cooperation.,4

2009-09-24,oba,"For decades, we averted disaster, even under the shadow of a superpower stand-off.",5
2009-09-24,oba,"But today, the threat of proliferation is growing in scope and complexity.",3

2009-09-24,oba,"A fragile consensus stands in the way of this frightening outcome, and that is the basic bargain that shapes the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.",5
2009-09-24,oba,It says that all nations have the right to peaceful nuclear energy; that nations with nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move toward disarmament; and those without them have the responsibility to forsake them.,5
2009-09-24,oba,The next 12 months could be pivotal in determining whether this compact will be strengthened or will slowly dissolve.,5
2009-09-24,oba,America intends to keep our end of the bargain.,5
2009-09-24,oba,We will pursue a new agreement with Russia to substantially reduce our strategic warheads and launchers.,3
2009-09-24,oba,"We will move forward with ratification of the Test Ban Treaty, and work with others to bring the treaty into force so that nuclear testing is permanently prohibited.",6
2009-09-24,oba,We will complete a Nuclear Posture Review that opens the door to deeper cuts and reduces the role of nuclear weapons.,7
2009-09-24,oba,And we will call upon countries to begin negotiations in January on a treaty to end the production of fissile material for weapons.,8
2009-09-24,oba,"I will also host a summit next April that reaffirms each nation's responsibility to secure nuclear material on its territory, and to help those who can't -- because we must never allow a single nuclear device to fall into the hands of a violent extremist.",8
2009-09-24,oba,And we will work to strengthen the institutions and initiatives that combat nuclear smuggling and theft.,5
2009-09-24,oba,All of this must support efforts to strengthen the NPT.,4
2009-09-24,oba,Those nations that refuse to live up to their obligations must face consequences.,6
2009-09-24,oba,"Let me be clear, this is not about singling out individual nations -- it is about standing up for the rights of all nations that do live up to their responsibilities.",10
2009-09-24,oba,"Because a world in which IAEA inspections are avoided and the United Nation's demands are ignored will leave all people less safe, and all nations less secure.",5
2009-09-24,oba,"In their actions to date, the governments of North Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous slope.",4
2009-09-24,oba,We respect their rights as members of the community of nations.,6
2009-09-24,oba,"I've said before and I will repeat, I am committed to diplomacy that opens a path to greater prosperity and more secure peace for both nations if they live up to their obligations.",9
2009-09-24,oba,But if the governments of Iran and North Korea choose to ignore international standards; if they put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the security and opportunity of their own people; if they are oblivious to the dangers of escalating nuclear arms races in both East Asia and the Middle East -- then they must be held accountable.,10
2009-09-24,oba,"The world must stand together to demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise, and that treaties will be enforced.",4
2009-09-24,oba,We must insist that the future does not belong to fear.,3
2009-09-24,oba,That brings me to the second pillar for our future:  the pursuit of peace.,5
2009-09-24,oba,"The United Nations was born of the belief that the people of the world can live their lives, raise their families, and resolve their differences peacefully.",7
2009-09-24,oba,"And yet we know that in too many parts of the world, this ideal remains an abstraction -- a distant dream.",6
2009-09-24,oba,"We can either accept that outcome as inevitable, and tolerate constant and crippling conflict, or we can recognize that the yearning for peace is universal, and reassert our resolve to end conflicts around the world.",9
2009-09-24,oba,"That effort must begin with an unshakeable determination that the murder of innocent men, women and children will never be tolerated.",8
2009-09-24,oba,"On this, no one can be -- there can be no dispute.",3
2009-09-24,oba,The violent extremists who promote conflict by distorting faith have discredited and isolated themselves.,5
2009-09-24,oba,They offer nothing but hatred and destruction.,4
2009-09-24,oba,"In confronting them, America will forge lasting partnerships to target terrorists, share intelligence, and coordinate law enforcement and protect our people.",4
2009-09-24,oba,We will permit no safe haven for al Qaeda to launch attacks from Afghanistan or any other nation.,6
2009-09-24,oba,"We will stand by our friends on the front lines, as we and many nations will do in pledging support for the Pakistani people tomorrow.",7
2009-09-24,oba,"And we will pursue positive engagement that builds bridges among faiths, and new partnerships for opportunity.",4
2009-09-24,oba,"Our efforts to promote peace, however, cannot be limited to defeating violent extremists.",4
2009-09-24,oba,For the most powerful weapon in our arsenal is the hope of human beings -- the belief that the future belongs to those who would build and not destroy; the confidence that conflicts can end and a new day can begin.,9
2009-09-24,oba,"And that is why we will support -- we will strengthen our support for effective peacekeeping, while energizing our efforts to prevent conflicts before they take hold.",4
2009-09-24,oba,"We will pursue a lasting peace in Sudan through support for the people of Darfur and the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, so that we secure the peace that the Sudanese people deserve.",6
2009-09-24,oba,And in countries ravaged by violence -- from Haiti to Congo to East Timor -- we will work with the U.N. and other partners to support an enduring peace.,5
2009-09-24,oba,"I will also continue to seek a just and lasting peace between Israel, Palestine, and the Arab world.",7
2009-09-24,oba,We will continue to work on that issue.,4
2009-09-24,oba,"Yesterday, I had a constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.",5
2009-09-24,oba,We have made some progress.,2
2009-09-24,oba,Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security.,3
2009-09-24,oba,Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the Palestinians.,4
2009-09-24,oba,"As a result of these efforts on both sides, the economy in the West Bank has begun to grow.",7
2009-09-24,oba,But more progress is needed.,2
2009-09-24,oba,"We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel, and we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.",7
2009-09-24,oba,"The time has come -- the time has come to re-launch negotiations without preconditions that address the permanent status issues:  security for Israelis and Palestinians, borders, refugees, and Jerusalem.",11
2009-09-24,oba,"And the goal is clear:  Two states living side by side in peace and security -- a Jewish state of Israel, with true security for all Israelis; and a viable, independent Palestinian state with contiguous territory that ends the occupation that began in 1967, and realizes the potential of the Palestinian people.",7
2009-09-24,oba,"As we pursue this goal, we will also pursue peace between Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Syria, and a broader peace between Israel and its many neighbors.",6
2009-09-24,oba,"In pursuit of that goal, we will develop regional initiatives with multilateral participation, alongside bilateral negotiations.",5
2009-09-24,oba,"Now, I am not naïve.",1
2009-09-24,oba,I know this will be difficult.,2
2009-09-24,oba,"But all of us -- not just the Israelis and the Palestinians, but all of us -- must decide whether we are serious about peace, or whether we will only lend it lip service.",5
2009-09-24,oba,"To break the old patterns, to break the cycle of insecurity and despair, all of us must say publicly what we would acknowledge in private.",5
2009-09-24,oba,The United States does Israel no favors when we fail to couple an unwavering commitment to its security with an insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims and rights of the Palestinians.,10
2009-09-24,oba,And -- And nations within this body do the Palestinians no favors when they choose vitriolic attacks against Israel over constructive willingness to recognize Israel's legitimacy and its right to exist in peace and security.,11
2009-09-24,oba,We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us.,5
2009-09-24,oba,It's not paid by politicians.,2
2009-09-24,oba,It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night.,11
2009-09-24,oba,It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own.,8
2009-09-24,oba,These are all God's children.,3
2009-09-24,oba,"And after all the politics and all the posturing, this is about the right of every human being to live with dignity and security.",8
2009-09-24,oba,That is a lesson embedded in the three great faiths that call one small slice of Earth the Holy Land.,10
2009-09-24,oba,"And that is why, even though there will be setbacks and false starts and tough days, I will not waver in my pursuit of peace.",6
2009-09-24,oba,"Third, we must recognize that in the 21st century, there will be no peace unless we take responsibility for the preservation of our planet.",8
2009-09-24,oba,And I thank the Secretary General for hosting the subject of climate change yesterday.,6
2009-09-24,oba,The danger posed by climate change cannot be denied.,5
2009-09-24,oba,Our responsibility to meet it must not be deferred.,3
2009-09-24,oba,"If we continue down our current course, every member of this Assembly will see irreversible changes within their borders.",4
2009-09-24,oba,Our efforts to end conflicts will be eclipsed by wars over refugees and resources.,5
2009-09-24,oba,Development will be devastated by drought and famine.,3
2009-09-24,oba,Land that human beings have lived on for millennia will disappear.,4
2009-09-24,oba,Future generations will look back and wonder why we refused to act; why we failed to pass on -- why we failed to pass on an environment that was worthy of our inheritance.,7
2009-09-24,oba,And that is why the days when America dragged its feet on this issue are over.,6
2009-09-24,oba,"We will move forward with investments to transform our energy economy, while providing incentives to make clean energy the profitable kind of energy.",6
2009-09-24,oba,"We will press ahead with deep cuts in emissions to reach the goals that we set for 2020, and eventually 2050.",5
2009-09-24,oba,"We will continue to promote renewable energy and efficiency, and share new technologies with countries around the world.",7
2009-09-24,oba,And we will seize every opportunity for progress to address this threat in a cooperative effort with the entire world.,9
2009-09-24,oba,And those wealthy nations that did so much damage to the environment in the 20th century must accept our obligation to lead.,6
2009-09-24,oba,But responsibility does not end there.,1
2009-09-24,oba,"While we must acknowledge the need for differentiated responses, any effort to curb carbon emissions must include the fast-growing carbon emitters who can do more to reduce their air pollution without inhibiting growth.",6
2009-09-24,oba,And any effort that fails to help the poorest nations both adapt to the problems that climate change have already wrought and help them travel a path of clean development simply will not work.,13
2009-09-24,oba,It's hard to change something as fundamental as how we use energy.,6
2009-09-24,oba,I know that.,1
2009-09-24,oba,It's even harder to do so in the midst of a global recession.,7
2009-09-24,oba,"Certainly, it will be tempting to sit back and wait for others to move first.",5
2009-09-24,oba,But we cannot make this journey unless we all move forward together.,3
2009-09-24,oba,"As we head into Copenhagen, let us resolve to focus on what each of us can do for the sake of our common future.",9
2009-09-24,oba,And this leads me to the final pillar that must fortify our future:  a global economy that advances opportunity for all people.,7
2009-09-24,oba,The world is still recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.,3
2009-09-24,oba,"In America, we see the engine of growth beginning to churn, and yet many still struggle to find a job or pay their bills.",5
2009-09-24,oba,"Across the globe, we find promising signs, but little certainty about what lies ahead.",4
2009-09-24,oba,And far too many people in far too many places live through the daily crises that challenge our humanity -- the despair of an empty stomach; the thirst brought on by dwindling water supplies; the injustice of a child dying from a treatable disease; or a mother losing her life as she gives birth.,7
2009-09-24,oba,"In Pittsburgh, we will work with the world's largest economies to chart a course for growth that is balanced and sustained.",7
2009-09-24,oba,That means vigilance to ensure that we do not let up until our people are back to work.,7
2009-09-24,oba,That means taking steps to rekindle demand so that global recovery can be sustained.,5
2009-09-24,oba,"And that means setting new rules of the road and strengthening regulation for all financial centers, so that we put an end to the greed and the excess and the abuse that led us into this disaster, and prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again.",10
2009-09-24,oba,"At a time of such interdependence, we have a moral and pragmatic interest, however, in broader questions of development -- the questions of development that existed even before this crisis happened.",6
2009-09-24,oba,And so America will continue our historic effort to help people feed themselves.,4
2009-09-24,oba,"We have set aside $63 billion to carry forward the fight against HIV/AIDS, to end deaths from tuberculosis and malaria, to eradicate polio, and to strengthen public health systems.",5
2009-09-24,oba,We are joining with other countries to contribute H1N1 vaccines to the World Health Organization.,4
2009-09-24,oba,We will integrate more economies into a system of global trade.,5
2009-09-24,oba,"We will support the Millennium Development Goals, and approach next year's summit with a global plan to make them a reality.",7
2009-09-24,oba,And we will set our sights on the eradication of extreme poverty in our time.,5
2009-09-24,oba,Now is the time for all of us to do our part.,5
2009-09-24,oba,Growth will not be sustained or shared unless all nations embrace their responsibilities.,4
2009-09-24,oba,"And that means that wealthy nations must open their markets to more goods and extend a hand to those with less, while reforming international institutions to give more nations a greater voice.",6
2009-09-24,oba,And developing nations must root out the corruption that is an obstacle to progress -- for opportunity cannot thrive where individuals are oppressed and business have to pay bribes.,6
2009-09-24,oba,That is why we support honest police and independent judges; civil society and a vibrant private sector.,5
2009-09-24,oba,"Our goal is simple:  a global economy in which growth is sustained, and opportunity is available to all.",6
2009-09-24,oba,"Now, the changes that I've spoken about today will not be easy to make.",4
2009-09-24,oba,"And they will not be realized simply by leaders like us coming together in forums like this, as useful as that may be.",8
2009-09-24,oba,"For as in any assembly of members, real change can only come through the people we represent.",6
2009-09-24,oba,That is why we must do the hard work to lay the groundwork for progress in our own capitals.,8
2009-09-24,oba,"That's where we will build the consensus to end conflicts and to harness technology for peaceful purposes, to change the way we use energy, and to promote growth that can be sustained and shared.",6
2009-09-24,oba,I believe that the people of the world want this future for their children.,5
2009-09-24,oba,And that is why we must champion those principles which ensure that governments reflect the will of the people.,7
2009-09-24,oba,"These principles cannot be afterthoughts -- democracy and human rights are essential to achieving each of the goals that I've discussed today, because governments of the people and by the people are more likely to act in the broader interests of their own people, rather than narrow interests of those in power.",9
2009-09-24,oba,The test of our leadership will not be the degree to which we feed the fears and old hatreds of our people.,6
2009-09-24,oba,"True leadership will not be measured by the ability to muzzle dissent, or to intimidate and harass political opponents at home.",4
2009-09-24,oba,The people of the world want change.,4
2009-09-24,oba,They will not long tolerate those who are on the wrong side of history.,6
2009-09-24,oba,"This Assembly's Charter commits each of us -- and I quote -- ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women.""",7
2009-09-24,oba,"Among those rights is the freedom to speak your mind and worship as you please; the promise of equality of the races, and the opportunity for women and girls to pursue their own potential; the ability of citizens to have a say in how you are governed, and to have confidence in the administration of justice.",9
2009-09-24,oba,"For just as no nation should be forced to accept the tyranny of another nation, no individual should be forced to accept the tyranny of their own people.",7
2009-09-24,oba,"As an African American, I will never forget that I would not be here today without the steady pursuit of a more perfect union in my country.",8
2009-09-24,oba,"And that guides my belief that no matter how dark the day may seem, transformative change can be forged by those who choose to side with justice.",8
2009-09-24,oba,And I pledge that America will always stand with those who stand up for their dignity and their rights -- for the student who seeks to learn; the voter who demands to be heard; the innocent who longs to be free; the oppressed who yearns to be equal.,8
2009-09-24,oba,Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation from the outside.,3
2009-09-24,oba,"Each society must search for its own path, and no path is perfect.",3
2009-09-24,oba,Each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its people and in its past traditions.,7
2009-09-24,oba,And I admit that America has too often been selective in its promotion of democracy.,5
2009-09-24,oba,But that does not weaken our commitment; it only reinforces it.,3
2009-09-24,oba,There are basic principles that are universal; there are certain truths which are self-evident -- and the United States of America will never waver in our efforts to stand up for the right of people everywhere to determine their own destiny.,9
2009-09-24,oba,"Sixty-five years ago, a weary Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the American people in his fourth and final inaugural address.",4

2009-09-24,oba,"The United Nations was built by men and women like Roosevelt from every corner of the world -- from Africa and Asia, from Europe to the Americas.",6
2009-09-24,oba,These architects of international cooperation had an idealism that was anything but naïve -- it was rooted in the hard-earned lessons of war; rooted in the wisdom that nations could advance their interests by acting together instead of splitting apart.,9
2009-09-24,oba,Now it falls to us -- for this institution will be what we make of it.,4
2009-09-24,oba,"The United Nations does extraordinary good around the world -- feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, mending  places that have been broken.",6
2009-09-24,oba,"But it also struggles to enforce its will, and to live up to the ideals of its founding.",6
2009-09-24,oba,I believe that those imperfections are not a reason to walk away from this institution -- they are a calling to redouble our efforts.,8
2009-09-24,oba,"The United Nations can either be a place where we bicker about outdated grievances, or forge common ground; a place where we focus on what drives us apart, or what brings us together; a place where we indulge tyranny, or a source of moral authority.",8
2009-09-24,oba,"In short, the United Nations can be an institution that is disconnected from what matters in the lives of our citizens, or it can be an indispensable factor in advancing the interests of the people we serve.",9
2009-09-24,oba,We have reached a pivotal moment.,2
2009-09-24,oba,The United States stands ready to begin a new chapter of international cooperation -- one that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of all nations.,7
2009-09-24,oba,"And so, with confidence in our cause, and with a commitment to our values, we call on all nations to join us in building the future that our people so richly deserve.",7
2009-09-24,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2009-10-09,oba,"Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, citizens of America, and citizens of the world:
 
I receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility.",7

2009-10-09,oba,"And yet, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"Compared to some of the giants of history who've received this prize -- Schweitzer and King, Marshall and Mandela -- my accomplishments are slight.",11
2009-10-09,oba,And then there are the men and women around the world who've been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice; those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering; the unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened cynics.,7
2009-10-09,oba,"I cannot argue with those who find these men and women -- some known, some obscure to all but those they help -- to be far more deserving of this honor than I.",6
2009-10-09,oba,But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars.,8
2009-10-09,oba,One of these wars is winding down.,4
2009-10-09,oba,"The other is a conflict that America did not seek, one in which we are joined by 42 other countries -- including Norway -- in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks.",9
2009-10-09,oba,"Still, we are at war.",2
2009-10-09,oba,And I am responsible1 for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land.,7
2009-10-09,oba,Some will kill; and some will be killed.,2
2009-10-09,oba,"And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict -- filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace, and our effort to replace one with the other.",8
2009-10-09,oba,Now these questions are not new.,2
2009-10-09,oba,"War, in one form or another, appeared with the first man.",3
2009-10-09,oba,"At the dawn of history, its morality was not questioned; it was simply a fact, like drought or disease -- the manner in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their differences.",6
2009-10-09,oba,"And over time, as codes of law sought to control violence within groups, so did philosophers and clerics and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war.",6
2009-10-09,oba,"The concept of a ""just war"" emerged, suggesting that war is justified only when certain conditions were met: if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense; if the force used is proportional; and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"Of course, we know that for most of history, this concept of ""just war"" was rarely observed.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"The capacity of human beings to think up new ways to kill one another proved inexhaustible, as did our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God.",9
2009-10-09,oba,Wars between armies gave way to wars between nations -- total wars in which the distinction between combatant and civilian became blurred.,10
2009-10-09,oba,"In the span of 30 years, such carnage would twice engulf this continent.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"And while it's hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the Third Reich and the Axis powers, World War II was a conflict in which the total number of civilians who died exceeded the number of soldiers who perished.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"In the wake of such destruction, and with the advent of the nuclear age, it became clear to victor and vanquished alike that the world needed institutions to prevent another world war.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"And so a quarter century after the United States Senate rejected the League of Nations -- an idea for which Woodrow Wilson received this prize -- America led the world in constructing an architecture to keep the peace: a Marshall Plan, and a United Nations; mechanisms to govern the waging of war, treaties to protect human rights, prevent genocide, restrict the most dangerous weapons.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"In many ways, these efforts succeeded.",3
2009-10-09,oba,"Yes, terrible wars have been fought, and atrocities committed.",2
2009-10-09,oba,But there has been no Third World War.,3
2009-10-09,oba,The Cold War ended with jubilant crowds dismantling a wall.,5

2009-10-09,oba,"Terrorism has long been a tactic, but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"Moreover, wars between nations have increasingly given way to wars within nations.",3
2009-10-09,oba,"The resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflicts; the growth of secessionist movements, insurgencies, and failed states -- all these things have increasingly trapped civilians in unending chaos.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"In today's wars, many more civilians are killed than soldiers; the seeds of future conflict are sown, economies are wrecked, civil societies torn asunder, refugees amassed, children scarred.",6
2009-10-09,oba,I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war.,5
2009-10-09,oba,"What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision, hard work, and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago.",9
2009-10-09,oba,"And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of ""just war"" and the imperatives of a just peace.",11
2009-10-09,oba,We must begin by acknowledging a hard truth: We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes.,5
2009-10-09,oba,"There will be times when nations, acting individually or in concert, will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.",4
2009-10-09,oba,"I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago: ""Violence never brings permanent peace.",7

2009-10-09,oba,I face the world as it is and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people.,9
2009-10-09,oba,For make no mistake: Evil does exist in the world.,4
2009-10-09,oba,A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler's armies.,3
2009-10-09,oba,Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms.,3
2009-10-09,oba,To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism.,4
2009-10-09,oba,"It is a recognition of history, the imperfections of man, and the limits of reason.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"I raise this point, I begin with this point because in many countries there is a deep ambivalence about military action today -- no matter what the cause.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"And at times, this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of America, the world's sole military superpower.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"Yet, the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions -- not just treaties and declarations -- that brought stability to a post-World War II world.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms.",9
2009-10-09,oba,"The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans.",7
2009-10-09,oba,We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will.,4
2009-10-09,oba,"We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.",6
2009-10-09,oba,"So yes, the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace.",6
2009-10-09,oba,"And yet this truth must coexist with another: that no matter how justified, war promises human tragedy.",4
2009-10-09,oba,"The soldier's courage and sacrifice is full of glory -- expressing devotion to country, to cause, to comrades in arms.",6
2009-10-09,oba,But war itself is never glorious; and we must never trumpet it as such.,3
2009-10-09,oba,So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly irreconcilable truths: that war is sometimes necessary; and war at some level is an expression of human folly.,7

2009-10-09,oba,What might this evolution look like?,2
2009-10-09,oba,What might these practical steps be?,2
2009-10-09,oba,"To begin with, I believe that all nations, strong and weak alike, must adhere to standards that govern the use of force.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"I, like any head of state, reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"Nevertheless, I am convinced that adhering to standards, international standards, strengthens those who do and isolates and weakens those who don't.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"The world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan, because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self-defense.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"Likewise, the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait -- a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"Furthermore, America -- in fact, no nation -- can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"For when we don't, our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions, no matter how justified.",5
2009-10-09,oba,And this becomes particularly important when the purpose of military action extends beyond self-defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor.,7
2009-10-09,oba,"More and more, we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government, or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region.",8
2009-10-09,oba,"I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war.",7
2009-10-09,oba,Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later.,5
2009-10-09,oba,That's why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace.,7
2009-10-09,oba,America's commitment to global security will never waver.,4
2009-10-09,oba,But in a world in which threats are more diffuse and missions more complex America cannot act alone.,5
2009-10-09,oba,America alone cannot secure the peace.,2
2009-10-09,oba,This is true in Afghanistan.,2
2009-10-09,oba,"This is true in failed states like Somalia, where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering.",9
2009-10-09,oba,"And sadly, it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"The leaders and soldiers of NATO countries, and other friends and allies, demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they've shown in Afghanistan.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"But in many countries, there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"I understand why war is not popular, but I also know this: The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it.",5
2009-10-09,oba,Peace requires responsibility.,1
2009-10-09,oba,Peace entails sacrifice.,1
2009-10-09,oba,That's why NATO continues to be indispensable.,3
2009-10-09,oba,"That's why we must strengthen U.N. and regional peacekeeping, and not leave the task to a few countries.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"That's why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome, to Ottawa and Sydney, to Dhaka and Kigali.",8
2009-10-09,oba,"We honor them not as makers of war, but as -- of wagers -- but as wagers of peace.",5
2009-10-09,oba,Let me make one final point about the use of force.,6
2009-10-09,oba,"Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war, we must also think clearly about how we fight it.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant -- the founder of the Red Cross, and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions.",11
2009-10-09,oba,"Where force is necessary, we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules, I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war.",6
2009-10-09,oba,That is what makes us different from those whom we fight.,6
2009-10-09,oba,That is a source of our strength.,4
2009-10-09,oba,That is why I prohibited torture.,2
2009-10-09,oba,That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed.,5
2009-10-09,oba,And that is why I have reaffirmed America's commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions.,6
2009-10-09,oba,We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend.,5
2009-10-09,oba,"And we honor -- we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it's easy, but when it is hard.",4
2009-10-09,oba,I've spoken at some length to the question that must weigh on our minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war.,7
2009-10-09,oba,"But let me now turn to our effort to avoid such tragic choices, and speak of three ways that we can build a just and lasting peace.",11
2009-10-09,oba,"First, in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws, I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"For if we want a lasting peace, then the words of the international community must mean something.",4
2009-10-09,oba,Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable.,4
2009-10-09,oba,Sanctions must exact a real price.,2
2009-10-09,oba,Intransigence must be met with increased pressure -- and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one.,4
2009-10-09,oba,"One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to seek a world without them.",6
2009-10-09,oba,"In the middle of the last century, nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear: All will have access to peaceful nuclear power; those without nuclear weapons will forsake them; and those with nuclear weapons will work towards disarmament.",8
2009-10-09,oba,I am committed to upholding this treaty.,5
2009-10-09,oba,It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy.,4
2009-10-09,oba,And I'm working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russia's nuclear stockpiles.,5
2009-10-09,oba,But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system.,7
2009-10-09,oba,Those who claim to respect international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted.,5
2009-10-09,oba,Those who care for their own security cannot ignore the danger of an arms race in the Middle East or East Asia.,7
2009-10-09,oba,Those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war.,4
2009-10-09,oba,The same principle applies to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own people.,7
2009-10-09,oba,"When there is genocide in Darfur, systematic rape in Congo, repression in Burma -- there must be consequences.",10
2009-10-09,oba,"Yes, there will be engagement.",1
2009-10-09,oba,"Yes, there will be diplomacy.",1
2009-10-09,oba,But there must be consequences when those things fail.,3
2009-10-09,oba,"And the closer we stand together, the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression.",8
2009-10-09,oba,This brings me to a second point: the nature of the peace that we seek.,6
2009-10-09,oba,For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict.,4
2009-10-09,oba,Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting.,7
2009-10-09,oba,It was this insight that drove drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after the Second World War.,8
2009-10-09,oba,"In the wake of devastation, they recognized that if human rights are not protected, peace is a hollow promise.",4
2009-10-09,oba,"And yet, too often these words are ignored.",2
2009-10-09,oba,"For some countries, the failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that these are somehow Western principles, foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation's development.",11
2009-10-09,oba,"And within America, there's long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists -- a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world.",14
2009-10-09,oba,I reject these choices.,2
2009-10-09,oba,I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please; choose their own leaders or assemble without fear.,8
2009-10-09,oba,"Pent-up grievances fester, and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence.",6
2009-10-09,oba,We also know that the opposite is true.,3
2009-10-09,oba,Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace.,3
2009-10-09,oba,"America has never fought a war against a democracy, and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens.",7
2009-10-09,oba,"No matter how callously defined, neither America's interests -- nor the world's -- are served by the denial of human aspirations.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries, America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like Aung Sang Suu Kyi, to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings, to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran.",10
2009-10-09,oba,It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation.,7
2009-10-09,oba,And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear that these movements -- these movements of hope and history -- they have us on their side.,8
2009-10-09,oba,Let me also say this: The promotion of human rights cannot be about exhortation alone.,4
2009-10-09,oba,"At times, it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy.",3
2009-10-09,oba,I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation.,5
2009-10-09,oba,But I also know that sanctions without outreach -- condemnation without discussion -- can carry forward only a crippling status quo.,5
2009-10-09,oba,No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door.,5
2009-10-09,oba,"In light of the Cultural Revolution's horrors, Nixon's meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable -- and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies.",9
2009-10-09,oba,"Pope John Paul's engagement with Poland created space not just for the Catholic Church, but for labor leaders like Lech Walesa.",6
2009-10-09,oba,"Ronald Reagan's efforts on arms control and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet Union, but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe.",5
2009-10-09,oba,There's no simple formula here.,2
2009-10-09,oba,"But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement, pressure and incentives, so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time.",5
2009-10-09,oba,"Third, a just peace includes not only civil and political rights -- it must encompass economic security and opportunity.",4

2009-12-19,oba,I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time.,4
2009-12-19,oba,"And at this point, the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart, whether we prefer posturing to action.",5

2009-12-25,oba,"The second review will examine all screening policies, technologies, and procedures related to air travel.",8
2009-12-25,oba,We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks.,8

2010-01-12,oba,And today I'm also announcing an immediate investment of $100 million to support our relief efforts.,4
2010-01-12,oba,"This will mean more of the life-saving equipment, food, water, and medicine that will be needed.",6
2010-01-12,oba,This investment will grow over the coming year as we embark on the long-term recovery from this unimaginable tragedy.,6
2010-01-12,oba,The United States of America will also forge the partnerships that this undertaking demands.,3
2010-01-12,oba,We will partner with the Haitian people.,3
2010-01-12,oba,"And that includes the Government of Haiti, which needs our support as they recover from the devastation of this earthquake.",8
2010-01-12,oba,It also includes the many Haitian Americans who are determined to help their friends and family.,6
2010-01-12,oba,And I've asked Vice President Biden to meet in south Florida this weekend with members of the Haitian American community and with responders who are mobilizing to help the Haitian people.,8

2010-01-12,oba,"We have no doubt that we can carry on the work that was done by so many of the U.N. effort that have been lost, and we see that their legacy is Haiti's hope for the future.",10
2010-01-12,oba,"Now, we will partner with other nations and organizations.",3
2010-01-12,oba,And that's why I've been reaching out to leaders from across the Americas and beyond who are sending resources to support this effort.,8
2010-01-12,oba,And we will join with the strong network of nongovernmental organizations across the country who understand the daily struggles of the Haitian people.,7
2010-01-12,oba,"Yet even as we bring our resources to bear on this emergency, we need to summon the tremendous generosity and compassion of the American people.",5

2010-01-12,oba,"Finally, I want to speak directly to the people of Haiti: Few in the world have endured the hardships that you have known.",6
2010-01-12,oba,"Long before this tragedy, daily life itself was often a bitter struggle.",3
2010-01-12,oba,"And after suffering so much for so long, to face this new horror must cause some to look up and ask, have we somehow been forsaken?",5
2010-01-12,oba,"To the people of Haiti, we say clearly and with conviction: You will not be forsaken; you will not be forgotten.",4
2010-01-12,oba,"In this, your hour of greatest need, America stands with you.",4

2010-03-04,oba,"And I want to thank Julie, Barbara, Roland, Stephen, Renee, and Christopher, standing behind me -- physicians, physicians assistants, and nurses who understand how important it is for us to make much needed changes in our health care system.",13
2010-03-04,oba,I want to thank all of you who are here today.,4
2010-03-04,oba,"I want to specially recognize two people who have been working tirelessly on that -- on this effort, my Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius -- as well as our quarterback for health reform out of the White House, Nancy-Ann DeParle.",8
2010-03-04,oba,"We began our push to reform health insurance last March, in this room, with doctors and nurses who know the system best.",5
2010-03-04,oba,And so it’s fitting to be joined by all of you as we bring this journey to a close.,6
2010-03-04,oba,"Last Thursday, I spent seven hours at a summit where Democrats and Republicans engaged in a public and very substantive discussion about health care.",8
2010-03-04,oba,This meeting capped off a debate that began with a similar summit nearly one year ago.,8
2010-03-04,oba,"And since then, every idea has been put on the table.",3
2010-03-04,oba,Every argument has been made.,2
2010-03-04,oba,Everything there is to say about health care has been said -- and just about everybody has said it.,6
2010-03-04,oba,"So now is the time to make a decision about how to finally reform health care so that it works, not just for the insurance companies, but for America’s families and America’s businesses.",7
2010-03-04,oba,"Now, where both sides say they agree is that the status quo is not working for the American people.",4
2010-03-04,oba,Health insurance is becoming more expensive by the day.,3
2010-03-04,oba,Families can’t afford it.,1
2010-03-04,oba,Businesses can’t afford it.,1
2010-03-04,oba,The federal government can’t afford it.,2
2010-03-04,oba,Smaller businesses and individuals who don’t get coverage at work are squeezed especially hard.,5
2010-03-04,oba,And insurance companies freely ration health care based on who’s sick and who’s healthy; who can pay and who can’t.,6
2010-03-04,oba,That's the status quo.,2
2010-03-04,oba,That's the system we have right now.,4
2010-03-04,oba,Democrats and Republicans agree that this is a serious problem for America.,4
2010-03-04,oba,And we agree that if we do nothing -- if we throw up our hands and walk away -- it’s a problem that will only grow worse.,4
2010-03-04,oba,Nobody disputes that.,1
2010-03-04,oba,More Americans will lose their family's health insurance if they switch jobs or lose their job.,4
2010-03-04,oba,More small businesses will be forced to choose between health care and hiring.,4
2010-03-04,oba,"More insurance companies will deny people coverage who have preexisting conditions, or they'll drop people's coverage when they get sick and need it most.",4
2010-03-04,oba,And the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid will sink our government deeper and deeper and deeper into debt.,4
2010-03-04,oba,On all of this we agree.,4
2010-03-04,oba,"So the question is, what do we do about it?",3
2010-03-04,oba,"On one end of the spectrum, there are some who've suggested scrapping our system of private insurance and replacing it with a government-run health care system.",8
2010-03-04,oba,"And though many other countries have such a system, in America it would be neither practical nor realistic.",3
2010-03-04,oba,"On the other end of the spectrum, there are those, and this includes most Republicans in Congress, who believe the answer is to loosen regulations on the insurance industry -- whether it's state consumer protections or minimum standards for the kind of insurance they can sell.",9
2010-03-04,oba,"The argument is, is that that will somehow lower costs.",4
2010-03-04,oba,I disagree with that approach.,3
2010-03-04,oba,I'm concerned that this would only give the insurance industry even freer rein to raise premiums and deny care.,6
2010-03-04,oba,So I don't believe we should give government bureaucrats or insurance company bureaucrats more control over health care in America.,6
2010-03-04,oba,I believe it's time to give the American people more control over their health care and their health insurance.,8
2010-03-04,oba,I don't believe we can afford to leave life-and-death decisions about health care to the discretion of insurance company executives alone.,11
2010-03-04,oba,I believe that doctors and nurses and physician assistants like the ones in this room should be free to decide what's best for their patients.,7
2010-03-04,oba,"Now, the proposal I put forward gives Americans more control over their health insurance and their health care by holding insurance companies more accountable.",5
2010-03-04,oba,It builds on the current system where most Americans get their health insurance from their employer.,6
2010-03-04,oba,"If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.",3
2010-03-04,oba,"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.",3
2010-03-04,oba,"I can tell you as the father of two young girls, I would not want any plan that interferes with the relationship between a family and their doctor.",8
2010-03-04,oba,"Essentially, my proposal would change three things about the current health care system.",5
2010-03-04,oba,"First, it would end the worst practices of insurance companies.",4
2010-03-04,oba,No longer would they be able to deny your coverage because of a preexisting condition.,5
2010-03-04,oba,No longer would they be able to drop your coverage because you got sick.,4
2010-03-04,oba,No longer would they be able to force you to pay unlimited amounts of money out of your own pocket.,7
2010-03-04,oba,No longer would they be able to arbitrarily and massively raise premiums like Anthem Blue Cross recently tried to do in California -- up to 39 percent increases in one year in the individual market.,6
2010-03-04,oba,Those practices would end.,2
2010-03-04,oba,"Second, my proposal would give uninsured individuals and small business owners the same kind of choice of private health insurance that members of Congress get for themselves -- because if it’s good enough for members of Congress, it’s good enough for the people who pay their salaries.",7
2010-03-04,oba,"The reason federal employees get a good deal on health insurance is that we all participate in an insurance market where insurance companies give better coverage and better rates, because they get more customers.",7
2010-03-04,oba,"It's an idea that many Republicans have embraced in the past, before politics intruded.",5
2010-03-04,oba,"And my proposal says that if you still can’t afford the insurance in this new marketplace, even though it's going to provide better deals for people than they can get right now in the individual marketplace, then we'll offer you tax credits to do so -- tax credits that add up to the largest middle-class tax cut for health care in history.",9
2010-03-04,oba,"After all, the wealthiest among us can already buy the best insurance there is, and the least well off are able to get coverage through Medicaid.",5
2010-03-04,oba,"So it's the middle class that gets squeezed, and that’s who we have to help.",4
2010-03-04,oba,"Now, it is absolutely true that all of this will cost some money -- about $100 billion per year.",5
2010-03-04,oba,But most of this comes from the nearly $2 trillion a year that America already spends on health care -- but a lot of it is not spent wisely.,6
2010-03-04,oba,A lot of that money is being wasted or spent badly.,4
2010-03-04,oba,"So within this plan, we’re going to make sure the dollars we spend go towards making insurance more affordable and more secure.",8
2010-03-04,oba,We’re going to eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go to insurance and pharmaceutical companies; set a new fee on insurance companies that stand to gain a lot of money and a lot of profits as millions of Americans are able to buy insurance; and we're going to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share on Medicare.,9
2010-03-04,oba,The bottom line is our proposal is paid for.,3
2010-03-04,oba,And all the new money generated in this plan goes back to small businesses and middle-class families who can't afford health insurance.,7
2010-03-04,oba,It would also lower prescription drug prices for seniors.,2
2010-03-04,oba,And it would help train new doctors and nurses and physician assistants to provide care for American families.,5
2010-03-04,oba,"Finally, my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for millions -- families, businesses, and the federal government.",7
2010-03-04,oba,"We have now incorporated most of the serious ideas from across the political spectrum about how to contain the rising cost of health care -- ideas that go after the waste and abuse in our system, especially in programs like Medicare.",16
2010-03-04,oba,"But we do this while protecting Medicare benefits, and extending the financial stability of the program by nearly a decade.",6
2010-03-04,oba,"Our cost-cutting measures mirror most of the proposals in the current Senate bill, which reduces most people's premiums and brings down our deficit by up to a trillion dollars over the next two decades -- brings down our deficit.",12
2010-03-04,oba,"Those aren't my numbers; those are the savings determined by the Congressional Budget Office, which is the Washington acronym for the nonpartisan, independent referee of Congress in terms of how much stuff costs.",11
2010-03-04,oba,So that's our proposal.,2
2010-03-04,oba,This is where we've ended up.,2
2010-03-04,oba,It's an approach that has been debated and changed and I believe improved over the last year.,5
2010-03-04,oba,"It incorporates the best ideas from Democrats and Republicans -- including some of the ideas that Republicans offered during the health care summit, like funding state grants on medical malpractice reform, and curbing waste and fraud and abuse in the health care system.",10
2010-03-04,oba,My proposal also gets rid of many of the provisions that had no place in health care reform -- provisions that were more about winning individual votes in Congress than improving health care for all Americans.,13
2010-03-04,oba,"Now, despite all that we agree on and all the Republican ideas we've incorporated, many -- probably most -- Republicans in Congress just have a fundamental disagreement over whether we should have more or less oversight of insurance companies.",7
2010-03-04,oba,"And if they truly believe that less regulation would lead to higher quality, more affordable health insurance, then they should vote against the proposal I've put forward.",6
2010-03-04,oba,"Now, some also believe that we should, instead of doing what I'm proposing, pursue a piecemeal approach to health insurance reform, where we tinker around the edges of this challenge for the next few years.",10
2010-03-04,oba,Even those who acknowledge the problem of the uninsured say we just can't afford to help them right now -- which is why the Republican proposal only covers 3 million uninsured Americans while we cover over 31 million.,6
2010-03-04,oba,"The problem with that approach is that unless everyone has access to affordable coverage, you can't prevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions; you can't limit the amount families are forced to pay out of their own pockets.",9
2010-03-04,oba,The insurance reforms rest on everybody having access to coverage.,4
2010-03-04,oba,"And you also don't do anything about the fact that taxpayers currently end up subsidizing the uninsured when they're forced to go to the emergency room for care, to the tune of about a thousand bucks per family.",11
2010-03-04,oba,You can't get those savings if those people are still going to the emergency room.,4
2010-03-04,oba,"So the fact is, health reform only works if you take care of all of these problems at once.",7
2010-03-04,oba,"Now, both during and after last week's summit, Republicans in Congress insisted that the only acceptable course on health care reform is to start over.",6
2010-03-04,oba,"But given these honest and substantial differences between the parties about the need to regulate the insurance industry and the need to help millions of middle-class families get insurance, I don't see how another year of negotiations would help.",14
2010-03-04,oba,"Moreover, the insurance companies aren't starting over.",2
2010-03-04,oba,They're continuing to raise premiums and deny coverage as we speak.,4
2010-03-04,oba,"For us to start over now could simply lead to delay that could last for another decade, or even more.",7
2010-03-04,oba,"The American people, and the U.S. economy, just can't wait that long.",3
2010-03-04,oba,"So, no matter which approach you favor, I believe the United States Congress owes the American people a final vote on health care reform.",6
2010-03-04,oba,"We have debated this issue thoroughly, not just for the past year but for decades.",3
2010-03-04,oba,Reform has already passed the House with a majority.,3
2010-03-04,oba,It has already passed the Senate with a supermajority of 60 votes.,5
2010-03-04,oba,"And now it deserves the same kind of up or down vote that was cast on welfare reform, that was cast on the Children's Health Insurance Program, that was used for COBRA health coverage for the unemployed, and, by the way, for both Bush tax cuts -- all of which had to pass Congress with nothing more than a simple majority.",10
2010-03-04,oba,"I, therefore, ask leaders in both houses of Congress to finish their work and schedule a vote in the next few weeks.",5
2010-03-04,oba,"From now until then, I will do everything in my power to make the case for reform.",4
2010-03-04,oba,"And I urge every American who wants this reform to make their voice heard as well -- every family, every business, every patient, every doctor, every nurse, every physician’s assistant.",6
2010-03-04,oba,Make your voice heard.,3
2010-03-04,oba,This has been a long and wrenching debate.,3
2010-03-04,oba,It has stoked great passions among the American people and their representatives.,5
2010-03-04,oba,And that's because health care is a difficult issue.,3
2010-03-04,oba,It is a complicated issue.,2
2010-03-04,oba,"If it was easy, it would have been solved long ago.",2
2010-03-04,oba,"As all of you know from experience, health care can literally be an issue of life or death.",4
2010-03-04,oba,"And as a result, it easily lends itself to demagoguery and political gamesmanship, and misrepresentation and misunderstanding.",4
2010-03-04,oba,But that’s not an excuse for those of us who were sent here to lead.,6
2010-03-04,oba,That's not an excuse for us to walk away.,3
2010-03-04,oba,We can’t just give up because the politics are hard.,3
2010-03-04,oba,"I know there’s been a fascination, bordering on obsession, in this media town about what passing health insurance reform would mean for the next election and the one after that.",8
2010-03-04,oba,How will this play?,1
2010-03-04,oba,What will happen with the polls?,3
2010-03-04,oba,"I will leave it to others to sift through the politics, because that’s not what this is about.",4
2010-03-04,oba,That’s not why we’re here.,2
2010-03-04,oba,This is about what reform would mean for the mother with breast cancer whose insurance company will finally have to pay for her chemotherapy.,7
2010-03-04,oba,This is about what reform would mean for the small business owner who will no longer have to choose between hiring more workers or offering coverage to the employees she has.,13
2010-03-04,oba,"This is about what reform would mean for middle-class families who will be able to afford health insurance for the very first time in their lives and get a regular checkup once in a while, and have some security about their children if they get sick.",12
2010-03-04,oba,This is about what reform would mean for all those men and women I’ve met over the last few years who’ve been brave enough to share their stories.,12
2010-03-04,oba,"When we started our push for reform last year, I talked to a young mother in Wisconsin named Laura Klitzka.",5
2010-03-04,oba,She has two young children.,2
2010-03-04,oba,She thought she had beaten her breast cancer but then later discovered it had spread to her bones.,6
2010-03-04,oba,"She and her husband were working and had insurance, but their medical bills still landed them in debt.",3
2010-03-04,oba,And now she spends time worrying about that debt when all she wants to do is spend time with her children and focus on getting well.,6
2010-03-04,oba,This should not happen in the United States of America.,4
2010-03-04,oba,And it doesn’t have to.,1
2010-03-04,oba,"In the end, that's what this debate is about.",3
2010-03-04,oba,It's about what kind of country we want to be.,6
2010-03-04,oba,"It's about the millions of lives that would be touched and, in some cases, saved by making private health insurance more secure and more affordable.",6
2010-03-04,oba,"So at stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem, but our ability to solve any problem.",4
2010-03-04,oba,The American people want to know if it's still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and their future.,7
2010-03-04,oba,They are waiting for us to act.,2
2010-03-04,oba,They are waiting for us to lead.,2
2010-03-04,oba,"And as long as I hold this office, I intend to provide that leadership.",4
2010-03-04,oba,"I do not know how this plays politically, but I know it's right.",3
2010-03-04,oba,"And so I ask Congress to finish its work, and I look forward to signing this reform into law.",5
2010-03-04,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2010-03-04,oba,Let's get it done.,3
2010-03-24,oba,"Today, after almost a century of trying -- Today, after over a year of debate -- Today, after all the votes have been tallied, health insurance reform becomes law in the United States of America -- today.",5
2010-03-24,oba,It is fitting that Congress passed this historic legislation this week.,3
2010-03-24,oba,"For as we mark the turning of spring, we also mark a new season in America.",4
2010-03-24,oba,"In a few moments, when I sign this bill, all of the overheated rhetoric over reform will finally confront the reality of reform.",5
2010-03-24,oba,"And while the Senate still has a last round of improvements to make on this historic legislation -- and these are improvements I’m confident they will make swiftly -- the bill I’m signing will set in motion reforms that generations of Americans have fought for, and marched for, and hungered to see.",10
2010-03-24,oba,"It will take four years to implement fully many of these reforms, because we need to implement them responsibly.",5
2010-03-24,oba,We need to get this right.,3
2010-03-24,oba,But a host of desperately needed reforms will take effect right away.,5
2010-03-24,oba,"This year, we’ll start offering tax credits to about 4 million small businessmen and women to help them cover the cost of insurance for their employees.",7
2010-03-24,oba,That happens this year.,2
2010-03-24,oba,"This year, tens of thousands of uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions, the parents of children who have a preexisting condition, will finally be able to purchase the coverage they need.",6
2010-03-24,oba,That happens this year.,2
2010-03-24,oba,"This year, insurance companies will no longer be able to drop people’s coverage when they get sick.",5
2010-03-24,oba,They won’t be able to place lifetime limits or restrictive annual limits on the amount of care they can receive.,6
2010-03-24,oba,"This year, all new insurance plans will be required to offer free preventive care.",3
2010-03-24,oba,"And this year, young adults will be able to stay on their parents’ policies until they’re 26 years old.",6
2010-03-24,oba,That happens this year.,2
2010-03-24,oba,"And this year, seniors who fall in the coverage gap known as the doughnut hole will start getting some help.",8
2010-03-24,oba,"They’ll receive 250 dollars to help pay for prescriptions, and that will, over time, fill in the doughnut hole.",4
2010-03-24,oba,"And I want seniors to know, despite what some have said, these reforms will not cut your guaranteed benefits.",4
2010-03-24,oba,"In fact, under this law, Americans on Medicare will receive free preventive care without co-payments or deductibles.",3
2010-03-24,oba,That begins this year.,2
2010-03-24,oba,"Once this reform is implemented, health insurance exchanges will be created, a competitive marketplace where uninsured people and small businesses will finally be able to purchase affordable, quality insurance.",7
2010-03-24,oba,They will be able to be part of a big pool and get the same good deal that members of Congress get.,8
2010-03-24,oba,That’s what’s going to happen under this reform.,5
2010-03-24,oba,"And when this exchange is up and running, millions of people will get tax breaks to help them afford coverage, which represents the largest middle-class tax cut for health care in history.",9
2010-03-24,oba,That's what this reform is about.,3
2010-03-24,oba,"This legislation will also lower costs for families and for businesses and for the federal government, reducing our deficit by over one trillion dollars in the next two decades.",6
2010-03-24,oba,It is paid for.,1
2010-03-24,oba,It is fiscally responsible.,2
2010-03-24,oba,And it will help lift a decades-long drag on our economy.,4
2010-03-24,oba,That's part of what all of you together worked on and made happen.,6
2010-03-24,oba,"That our generation is able to succeed in passing this reform is a testament to the persistence --- and the character -- of the American people, who championed this cause; who mobilized; who organized; who believed that people who love this country can change it.",7
2010-03-24,oba,"It’s also a testament to the historic leadership -- and uncommon courage -- of the men and women of the United States Congress, who’ve taken their lumps during this difficult debate.",9
2010-03-24,oba,"Audience Member:  Yes, we did.",1
2010-03-24,oba,"President Obama:  You know, there are few tougher jobs in politics or government than leading one of our legislative chambers.",7
2010-03-24,oba,"In each chamber, there are men and women who come from different places and face different pressures, who reach different conclusions about the same things and feel deeply concerned about different things.",10
2010-03-24,oba,"By necessity, leaders have to speak to those different concerns.",4
2010-03-24,oba,It isn’t always tidy; it is almost never easy.,2
2010-03-24,oba,But perhaps the greatest -- and most difficult -- challenge is to cobble together out of those differences the sense of common interest and common purpose that’s required to advance the dreams of all people -- especially in a country as large and diverse as ours.,13
2010-03-24,oba,And we are blessed by leaders in each chamber who not only do their jobs very well but who never lost sight of that larger mission.,6
2010-03-24,oba,"They didn’t play for the short term; they didn’t play to the polls or to politics:  One of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",7
2010-03-24,oba,Audience:  Nancy!,2
2010-03-24,oba,Nancy!,1
2010-03-24,oba,Nancy!,1

2010-03-24,oba,"To all of the terrific committee chairs, all the members of Congress who did what was difficult, but did what was right, and passed health care reform -- not just this generation of Americans will thank you, but the next generation of Americans will thank you.",6
2010-03-24,oba,"And of course, this victory was also made possible by the painstaking work of members of this administration, including our outstanding Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius -- and one of the unsung heroes of this effort, an extraordinary woman who led the reform effort from the White House, Nancy-Ann DeParle.",12
2010-03-24,oba,Where’s Nancy?,1
2010-03-24,oba,"Today, I’m signing this reform bill into law on behalf of my mother, who argued with insurance companies even as she battled cancer in her final days.",9
2010-03-24,oba,"I’m signing it for Ryan Smith, who’s here today.",4
2010-03-24,oba,He runs a small business with five employees.,3
2010-03-24,oba,"He’s trying to do the right thing, paying half the cost of coverage for his workers.",5
2010-03-24,oba,This bill will help him afford that coverage.,3
2010-03-24,oba,"I’m signing it for 11-year-old Marcelas Owens, who’s also here.",5
2010-03-24,oba,Marcelas lost his mom to an illness.,3
2010-03-24,oba,And she didn’t have insurance and couldn’t afford the care that she needed.,4
2010-03-24,oba,So in her memory he has told her story across America so that no other children have to go through what his family has experienced.,6
2010-03-24,oba,I’m signing it for Natoma Canfield.,3
2010-03-24,oba,Natoma had to give up her health coverage after her rates were jacked up by more than 40 percent.,6
2010-03-24,oba,"She was terrified that an illness would mean she’d lose the house that her parents built, so she gave up her insurance.",8
2010-03-24,oba,"Now she’s lying in a hospital bed, as we speak, faced with just such an illness, praying that she can somehow afford to get well without insurance.",5
2010-03-24,oba,Natoma’s family is here today because Natoma can’t be.,3
2010-03-24,oba,And her sister Connie is here.,2
2010-03-24,oba,"Connie, stand up.",1
2010-03-24,oba,"I’m signing this bill for all the leaders who took up this cause through the generations -- from Teddy Roosevelt to Franklin Roosevelt, from Harry Truman, to Lyndon Johnson, from Bill and Hillary Clinton, to one of the deans who’s been fighting this so long, John Dingell.",7
2010-03-24,oba,To Senator Ted Kennedy.,2
2010-03-24,oba,"And it’s fitting that Ted’s widow, Vicki, is here -- it’s fitting that Teddy’s widow, Vicki, is here; and his niece Caroline; his son Patrick, whose vote helped make this reform a reality.",8
2010-03-24,oba,I remember seeing Ted walk through that door in a summit in this room a year ago -- one of his last public appearances.,7
2010-03-24,oba,And it was hard for him to make it.,2
2010-03-24,oba,But he was confident that we would do the right thing.,4
2010-03-24,oba,Our presence here today is remarkable and improbable.,2
2010-03-24,oba,"With all the punditry, all of the lobbying, all of the game-playing that passes for governing in Washington, it’s been easy at times to doubt our ability to do such a big thing, such a complicated thing; to wonder if there are limits to what we, as a people, can still achieve.",10
2010-03-24,oba,It’s easy to succumb to the sense of cynicism about what’s possible in this country.,10
2010-03-24,oba,"But today, we are affirming that essential truth -- a truth every generation is called to rediscover for itself -- that we are not a nation that scales back its aspirations.",6
2010-03-24,oba,We are not a nation that falls prey to doubt or mistrust.,4
2010-03-24,oba,We don't fall prey to fear.,2
2010-03-24,oba,We are not a nation that does what’s easy.,4
2010-03-24,oba,That’s not who we are.,2
2010-03-24,oba,That’s not how we got here.,2
2010-03-24,oba,We are a nation that faces its challenges and accepts its responsibilities.,5
2010-03-24,oba,We are a nation that does what is hard.,4
2010-03-24,oba,What is necessary.,1
2010-03-24,oba,What is right.,1
2010-03-24,oba,"Here, in this country, we shape our own destiny.",3
2010-03-24,oba,That is what we do.,2
2010-03-24,oba,That is who we are.,2
2010-03-24,oba,That is what makes us the United States of America.,4
2010-03-24,oba,"And we have now just enshrined, as soon as I sign this bill, the core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care.",9
2010-03-24,oba,And it is an extraordinary achievement that has happened because of all of you and all the advocates all across the country.,8
2010-03-24,oba,"So, thank you.",1
2010-03-24,oba,Thank you.,1
2010-03-24,oba,"God bless you, and may God bless the United States.",3

2010-03-24,oba,And we’re going to sign this bill.,3
2010-03-24,oba,This is going to take a little while.,3
2010-03-24,oba,"I’ve got to use every pen, so it’s going to take a really long time.",4
2010-03-24,oba,I didn’t practice.,1
2010-03-24,oba,We are done.,1
2010-04-15,oba,Thank you.,1
2010-04-15,oba,I want to thank Senator Bill Nelson and NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden for their extraordinary leadership.,5
2010-04-15,oba,"I want to recognize Dr. Buzz Aldrin as well, who’s in the house.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"Four decades ago, Buzz became a legend.",3
2010-04-15,oba,But in the four decades since he’s also been one of America’s leading visionaries and authorities on human space flight.,9
2010-04-15,oba,Few people -- present company excluded -- can claim the expertise of Buzz and Bill and Charlie when it comes to space exploration.,4
2010-04-15,oba,I have to say that few people are as singularly unimpressed by Air Force One as those three.,8
2010-04-15,oba,"Sure, it’s comfortable, but it can’t even reach low Earth orbit.",3
2010-04-15,oba,"And that obviously is in striking contrast to the Falcon 9 rocket we just saw on the launch pad, which will be tested for the very first time in the coming weeks.",13
2010-04-15,oba,A couple of other acknowledgments I want to make.,3
2010-04-15,oba,"We’ve got Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee from Texas visiting us, a big supporter of the space program.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"My director, Office of Science and Technology Policy -- in other words my chief science advisor -- John Holdren is here.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"And most of all I want to acknowledge your congresswoman Suzanne Kosmas, because every time I meet with her, including the flight down here, she reminds me of how important our NASA programs are and how important this facility is.",7
2010-04-15,oba,And she is fighting for every single one of you and for her district and for the jobs in her district.,7
2010-04-15,oba,And you should know that you’ve got a great champion in Congresswoman Kosmas.,5
2010-04-15,oba,Please give her a big round of applause.,3
2010-04-15,oba,I also want to thank everybody for participating in today’s conference.,7
2010-04-15,oba,"And gathered here are scientists, engineers, business leaders, public servants, and a few more astronauts as well.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"Last but not least, I want to thank the men and women of NASA for welcoming me to the Kennedy Space Center, and for your contributions not only to America, but to the world.",6
2010-04-15,oba,Here at the Kennedy Space Center we are surrounded by monuments and milestones of those contributions.,5
2010-04-15,oba,It was from here that NASA launched the missions of Mercury and Gemini and Apollo.,6
2010-04-15,oba,"It was from here that Space Shuttle Discovery, piloted by Charlie Bolden, carried the Hubble Telescope into orbit, allowing us to plumb the deepest recesses of our galaxy.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"And I should point out, by the way, that in my private office just off the Oval, I’ve got the picture of Jupiter from the Hubble.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"So thank you, Charlie, for helping to decorate my office.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"It was from here that men and women, propelled by sheer nerve and talent, set about pushing the boundaries of humanity’s reach.",8
2010-04-15,oba,That’s the story of NASA.,3
2010-04-15,oba,"And it’s a story that started a little more than half a century ago, far from the Space Coast, in a remote and desolate region of what is now called Kazakhstan.",8
2010-04-15,oba,"Because it was from there that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth, which was little more than a few pieces of metal with a transmitter and a battery strapped to the top of a missile.",12
2010-04-15,oba,But the world was stunned.,2
2010-04-15,oba,Americans were dumbfounded.,1
2010-04-15,oba,"The Soviets, it was perceived, had taken the lead in a race for which we were not yet fully prepared.",5
2010-04-15,oba,But we caught up very quick.,2
2010-04-15,oba,"President Eisenhower signed legislation to create NASA and to invest in science and math education, from grade school to graduate school.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"In 1961, President Kennedy boldly declared before a joint session of Congress that the United States would send a man to the Moon and return him safely to the Earth within the decade.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"And as a nation, we set about meeting that goal, reaping rewards that have in the decades since touched every facet of our lives.",9
2010-04-15,oba,NASA was at the forefront.,3
2010-04-15,oba,Many gave their careers to the effort.,3
2010-04-15,oba,And some have given far more.,2
2010-04-15,oba,"In the years that have followed, the space race inspired a generation of scientists and innovators, including, I’m sure, many of you.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"It’s contributed to immeasurable technological advances that have improved our health and well-being, from satellite navigation to water purification, from aerospace manufacturing to medical imaging.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"Although, I have to say, during a meeting right before I came out on stage somebody said, you know, it’s more than just Tang -- and I had to point out I actually really like Tang.",7
2010-04-15,oba,I thought that was very cool.,3
2010-04-15,oba,"And leading the world to space helped America achieve new heights of prosperity here on Earth, while demonstrating the power of a free and open society to harness the ingenuity of its people.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"And on a personal note, I have been part of that generation so inspired by the space program.",4
2010-04-15,oba,1961 was the year of my birth -- the year that Kennedy made his announcement.,5
2010-04-15,oba,"And one of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather’s shoulders, waving a flag as astronauts arrived in Hawaii.",4
2010-04-15,oba,"For me, the space program has always captured an essential part of what it means to be an American -- reaching for new heights, stretching beyond what previously did not seem possible.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"And so, as President, I believe that space exploration is not a luxury, it’s not an afterthought in America’s quest for a brighter future -- it is an essential part of that quest.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"So today, I’d like to talk about the next chapter in this story.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"The challenges facing our space program are different, and our imperatives for this program are different, than in decades past.",6
2010-04-15,oba,We’re no longer racing against an adversary.,3
2010-04-15,oba,We’re no longer competing to achieve a singular goal like reaching the Moon.,6
2010-04-15,oba,"In fact, what was once a global competition has long since become a global collaboration.",3
2010-04-15,oba,"But while the measure of our achievements has changed a great deal over the past 50 years, what we do -- or fail to do -- in seeking new frontiers is no less consequential for our future in space and here on Earth.",5
2010-04-15,oba,So let me start by being extremely clear:  I am 100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future.,9
2010-04-15,oba,Because broadening our capabilities in space will continue to serve our society in ways that we can scarcely imagine.,5
2010-04-15,oba,Because exploration will once more inspire wonder in a new generation -- sparking passions and launching careers.,4
2010-04-15,oba,"And because, ultimately, if we fail to press forward in the pursuit of discovery, we are ceding our future and we are ceding that essential element of the American character.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"I know there have been a number of questions raised about my administration’s plan for space exploration, especially in this part of Florida where so many rely on NASA as a source of income as well as a source of pride and community.",9
2010-04-15,oba,"And these questions come at a time of transition, as the space shuttle nears its scheduled retirement after almost 30 years of service.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"And understandably, this adds to the worries of folks concerned not only about their own futures but about the future of the space program to which they’ve devoted their lives.",13
2010-04-15,oba,"But I also know that underlying these concerns is a deeper worry, one that precedes not only this plan but this administration.",7
2010-04-15,oba,It stems from the sense that people in Washington -- driven sometimes less by vision than by politics -- have for years neglected NASA’s mission and undermined the work of the professionals who fulfill it.,7
2010-04-15,oba,"We’ve seen that in the NASA budget, which has risen and fallen with the political winds.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"But we can also see it in other ways:  in the reluctance of those who hold office to set clear, achievable objectives; to provide the resources to meet those objectives; and to justify not just these plans but the larger purpose of space exploration in the 21st century.",9
2010-04-15,oba,All that has to change.,3
2010-04-15,oba,"And with the strategy I’m outlining today, it will.",4
2010-04-15,oba,"We start by increasing NASA’s budget by $6 billion over the next five years, even -- I want people to understand the context of this.",6
2010-04-15,oba,This is happening even as we have instituted a freeze on discretionary spending and sought to make cuts elsewhere in the budget.,7
2010-04-15,oba,"So NASA, from the start, several months ago when I issued my budget, was one of the areas where we didn’t just maintain a freeze but we actually increased funding by $6 billion.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"By doing that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system, including a probe of the Sun’s atmosphere; new scouting missions to Mars and other destinations; and an advanced telescope to follow Hubble, allowing us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"We will increase Earth-based observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world -- science that will garner tangible benefits, helping us to protect our environment for future generations.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"And we will extend the life of the International Space Station likely by more than five years, while actually using it for its intended purpose:  conducting advanced research that can help improve the daily lives of people here on Earth, as well as testing and improving upon our capabilities in space.",13
2010-04-15,oba,This includes technologies like more efficient life support systems that will help reduce the cost of future missions.,9
2010-04-15,oba,"And in order to reach the space station, we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable.",9
2010-04-15,oba,"Now, I recognize that some have said it is unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in this way.",6
2010-04-15,oba,I disagree.,1
2010-04-15,oba,"The truth is, NASA has always relied on private industry to help design and build the vehicles that carry astronauts to space, from the Mercury capsule that carried John Glenn into orbit nearly 50 years ago, to the space shuttle Discovery currently orbiting overhead.",10
2010-04-15,oba,By buying the services of space transportation -- rather than the vehicles themselves -- we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standards are met.,6
2010-04-15,oba,But we will also accelerate the pace of innovations as companies -- from young startups to established leaders -- compete to design and build and launch new means of carrying people and materials out of our atmosphere.,11
2010-04-15,oba,"In addition, as part of this effort, we will build on the good work already done on the Orion crew capsule.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"I’ve directed Charlie Bolden to immediately begin developing a rescue vehicle using this technology, so we are not forced to rely on foreign providers if it becomes necessary to quickly bring our people home from the International Space Station.",7
2010-04-15,oba,And this Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions.,7
2010-04-15,oba,"In fact, Orion will be readied for flight right here in this room.",4
2010-04-15,oba,"Next, we will invest more than $3 billion to conduct research on an advanced “heavy lift rocket” -- a vehicle to efficiently send into orbit the crew capsules, propulsion systems, and large quantities of supplies needed to reach deep space.",14
2010-04-15,oba,"In developing this new vehicle, we will not only look at revising or modifying older models; we want to look at new designs, new materials, new technologies that will transform not just where we can go but what we can do when we get there.",7
2010-04-15,oba,And we will finalize a rocket design no later than 2015 and then begin to build it.,3
2010-04-15,oba,"And I want everybody to understand:  That’s at least two years earlier than previously planned -- and that’s conservative, given that the previous program was behind schedule and over budget.",8
2010-04-15,oba,"At the same time, after decades of neglect, we will increase investment -- right away -- in other groundbreaking technologies that will allow astronauts to reach space sooner and more often, to travel farther and faster for less cost, and to live and work in space for longer periods of time more safely.",11
2010-04-15,oba,That means tackling major scientific and technological challenges.,4
2010-04-15,oba,How do we shield astronauts from radiation on longer missions?,3
2010-04-15,oba,How do we harness resources on distant worlds?,3
2010-04-15,oba,How do we supply spacecraft with energy needed for these far-reaching journeys?,7
2010-04-15,oba,These are questions that we can answer and will answer.,4
2010-04-15,oba,And these are the questions whose answers no doubt will reap untold benefits right here on Earth.,5
2010-04-15,oba,So the point is what we’re looking for is not just to continue on the same path -- we want to leap into the future; we want major breakthroughs; a transformative agenda for NASA.,7
2010-04-15,oba,"Now, yes, pursuing this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy.",3
2010-04-15,oba,"In part, this is because the old strategy -- including the Constellation program -- was not fulfilling its promise in many ways.",5
2010-04-15,oba,That’s not just my assessment; that’s also the assessment of a panel of respected non-partisan experts charged with looking at these issues closely.,11
2010-04-15,oba,"Now, despite this, some have had harsh words for the decisions we’ve made, including some individuals who I’ve got enormous respect and admiration for.",8
2010-04-15,oba,"But what I hope is, is that everybody will take a look at what we are planning, consider the details of what we’ve laid out, and see the merits as I’ve described them.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"The bottom line is nobody is more committed to manned space flight, to human exploration of space than I am.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"But we’ve got to do it in a smart way, and we can’t just keep on doing the same old things that we’ve been doing and thinking that somehow is going to get us to where we want to go.",11
2010-04-15,oba,"Some have said, for instance, that this plan gives up our leadership in space by failing to produce plans within NASA to reach low Earth orbit, instead of relying on companies and other countries.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"But we will actually reach space faster and more often under this new plan, in ways that will help us improve our technological capacity and lower our costs, which are both essential for the long-term sustainability of space flight.",13
2010-04-15,oba,"In fact, through our plan, we’ll be sending many more astronauts to space over the next decade.",4
2010-04-15,oba,There are also those who criticized our decision to end parts of Constellation as one that will hinder space exploration below low Earth orbit.,11
2010-04-15,oba,"But it’s precisely by investing in groundbreaking research and innovative companies that we will have the potential to rapidly transform our capabilities -- even as we build on the important work already completed, through projects like Orion, for future missions.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"And unlike the previous program, we are setting a course with specific and achievable milestones.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"Early in the next decade, a set of crewed flights will test and prove the systems required for exploration beyond low Earth orbit.",8
2010-04-15,oba,"And by 2025, we expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the first-ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space.",7
2010-04-15,oba,So we’ll start -- we’ll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history.,6
2010-04-15,oba,"By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth.",5
2010-04-15,oba,And a landing on Mars will follow.,3
2010-04-15,oba,And I expect to be around to see it.,3
2010-04-15,oba,But I want to repeat -- I want to repeat this:  Critical to deep space exploration will be the development of breakthrough propulsion systems and other advanced technologies.,6
2010-04-15,oba,So I’m challenging NASA to break through these barriers.,4
2010-04-15,oba,And we’ll give you the resources to break through these barriers.,4
2010-04-15,oba,"And I know you will, with ingenuity and intensity, because that’s what you’ve always done.",3
2010-04-15,oba,"Now, I understand that some believe that we should attempt a return to the surface of the Moon first, as previously planned.",8
2010-04-15,oba,But I just have to say pretty bluntly here:  We’ve been there before.,3
2010-04-15,oba,Buzz has been there.,1
2010-04-15,oba,"There’s a lot more of space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do.",4
2010-04-15,oba,"So I believe it’s more important to ramp up our capabilities to reach -- and operate at -- a series of increasingly demanding targets, while advancing our technological capabilities with each step forward.",5
2010-04-15,oba,And that’s what this strategy does.,3
2010-04-15,oba,And that’s how we will ensure that our leadership in space is even stronger in this new century than it was in the last.,6
2010-04-15,oba,"Finally, I want to say a few words about jobs.",4
2010-04-15,oba,"Suzanne pointed out to me that the last time I was here, I made a very clear promise that I would help in the transition into a new program to make sure that people who are already going through a tough time here in this region were helped.",14
2010-04-15,oba,"And despite some reports to the contrary, my plan will add more than 2,500 jobs along the Space Coast in the next two years compared to the plan under the previous administration.",6
2010-04-15,oba,So I want to make that point.,3
2010-04-15,oba,"We’re going to modernize the Kennedy Space Center, creating jobs as we upgrade launch facilities.",5
2010-04-15,oba,And there’s potential for even more jobs as companies in Florida and across America compete to be part of a new space transportation industry.,10
2010-04-15,oba,And some of those industry leaders are here today.,4
2010-04-15,oba,"This holds the promise of generating more than 10,000 jobs nationwide over the next few years.",6
2010-04-15,oba,And many of these jobs will be created right here in Florida because this is an area primed to lead in this competition.,7
2010-04-15,oba,"Now, it’s true -- there are Floridians who will see their work on the shuttle end as the program winds down.",6
2010-04-15,oba,"This is based on a decision that was made six years ago, not six months ago, but that doesn’t make it any less painful for families and communities affected as this decision becomes reality.",8
2010-04-15,oba,"So I’m proposing -- in part because of strong lobbying by Bill and by Suzanne, as well as Charlie -- I’m proposing a $40 million initiative led by a high-level team from the White House, NASA, and other agencies to develop a plan for regional economic growth and job creation.",10
2010-04-15,oba,And I expect this plan to reach my desk by August 15th.,5
2010-04-15,oba,It’s an effort that will help prepare this already skilled workforce for new opportunities in the space industry and beyond.,8
2010-04-15,oba,So this is the next chapter that we can write together here at NASA.,5
2010-04-15,oba,We will partner with industry.,2
2010-04-15,oba,We will invest in cutting-edge research and technology.,4
2010-04-15,oba,We will set far-reaching milestones and provide the resources to reach those milestones.,4
2010-04-15,oba,"And step by step, we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do.",4
2010-04-15,oba,"Fifty years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach.",4
2010-04-15,oba,"Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite.",9
2010-04-15,oba,"And in fulfilling this task, we will not only extend humanity’s reach in space -- we will strengthen America’s leadership here on Earth.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"Now, I’ll close by saying this.",3
2010-04-15,oba,I know that some Americans have asked a question that’s particularly apt on Tax Day:  Why spend money on NASA at all?,7
2010-04-15,oba,Why spend money solving problems in space when we don’t lack for problems to solve here on the ground?,7
2010-04-15,oba,And obviously our country is still reeling from the worst economic turmoil we’ve known in generations.,5
2010-04-15,oba,We have massive structural deficits that have to be closed in the coming years.,6
2010-04-15,oba,But you and I know this is a false choice.,3
2010-04-15,oba,We have to fix our economy.,3
2010-04-15,oba,We need to close our deficits.,3
2010-04-15,oba,"But for pennies on the dollar, the space program has fueled jobs and entire industries.",5
2010-04-15,oba,"For pennies on the dollar, the space program has improved our lives, advanced our society, strengthened our economy, and inspired generations of Americans.",6
2010-04-15,oba,And I have no doubt that NASA can continue to fulfill this role.,5
2010-04-15,oba,"But that is why -- but I want to say clearly to those of you who work for NASA, but to the entire community that has been so supportive of the space program in this area:  That is exactly why it’s so essential that we pursue a new course and that we revitalize NASA and its mission -- not just with dollars, but with clear aims and a larger purpose.",10
2010-04-15,oba,"Now, little more than 40 years ago, astronauts descended the nine-rung ladder of the lunar module called Eagle, and allowed their feet to touch the dusty surface of the Earth’s only Moon.",7
2010-04-15,oba,"This was the culmination of a daring and perilous gambit -- of an endeavor that pushed the boundaries of our knowledge, of our technological prowess, of our very capacity as human beings to solve problems.",13
2010-04-15,oba,It wasn’t just the greatest achievement in NASA’s history -- it was one of the greatest achievements in human history.,6
2010-04-15,oba,And the question for us now is whether that was the beginning of something or the end of something.,7
2010-04-15,oba,I choose to believe it was only the beginning.,4
2010-04-15,oba,So thank you.,1
2010-04-15,oba,God bless you.,1
2010-04-15,oba,And may God bless the United States of America.,3
2010-04-15,oba,Thank you.,1
2010-04-22,oba,"Now, we just finished a meeting with Admiral Thad Allen, our national incident commander for this spill, as well as Coast Guard personnel who are leading the response to this crisis.",9
2010-04-22,oba,And they gave me an update on our efforts to stop the BP oil spill and mitigate the damage.,7
2010-04-22,oba,"By the way, I just want to point out, I was told there was drizzling out here.",4
2010-04-22,oba,Is this Louisiana drizzle right here?,2
2010-04-22,oba,They gave me a sense of how this spill is moving.,5
2010-04-22,oba,It is now about 9 miles off the coast of southeastern Louisiana.,5
2010-04-22,oba,"And by the way, we had the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal, as well as parish presidents who were taking part in this meeting because we want to emphasize the importance of coordinating between local, State, and Federal officials throughout this process.",13
2010-04-22,oba,"Now, I think the American people are now aware--certainly, the folks down in the Gulf are aware--that we're dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.",7
2010-04-22,oba,"The oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our Gulf States, and it could extend for a long time.",5
2010-04-22,oba,It could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home.,6
2010-04-22,oba,"And that's why the Federal Government has launched and coordinated an all-hands-on-deck, relentless response to this crisis from day one.",6
2010-04-22,oba,"After the explosion on the drilling rig, it began with an aggressive search and rescue effort to evacuate 115 people, including 3 badly injured.",7
2010-04-22,oba,And my thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the 11 workers who have not yet--who have not been found.,6
2010-04-22,oba,"When the drill unit sank on Thursday, we immediately and intensely investigated by remotely operated vehicles the entire 5,000 feet of pipe that's on the floor of the ocean.",7
2010-04-22,oba,"In that process, three leaks were identified, the most recent coming just last Wednesday evening.",3
2010-04-22,oba,"As Admiral Allen and Secretary Napolitano have made clear, we've made preparations from day one to stage equipment for a worst-case scenario.",5
2010-04-22,oba,We immediately set up command center operations here in the Gulf and coordinated with all State and local governments.,5
2010-04-22,oba,And the third breach was discovered on Wednesday.,2
2010-04-22,oba,We already had by that time in position more than 70 vessels and hundreds of thousands of feet of boom.,6
2010-04-22,oba,"And I dispatched the Secretaries of the Interior and Homeland Security, the Administrator of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, who is here, my Assistant for Energy and Climate Change Policy, and the Administrator of NOAA to the Gulf Coast to ensure that we are doing whatever is required to respond to this event.",7
2010-04-22,oba,"So I want to emphasize, from day one we have prepared and planned for the worst, even as we hoped for the best.",9
2010-04-22,oba,"And while we have prepared and reacted aggressively, I'm not going to rest--and none of the gentlemen and women who are here are going to rest--or be satisfied until the leak is stopped at the source, the oil on the Gulf is contained and cleaned up, and the people of this region are able to go back to their lives and their livelihoods.",9
2010-04-22,oba,"Now, currently, the most advanced technology available is being used to try and stop a leak that is more than 5,000 feet under the surface.",8
2010-04-22,oba,"Because this leak is unique and unprecedented, it could take many days to stop.",3
2010-04-22,oba,And that's why we're also using every resource available to stop the oil from coming ashore and mitigating the damage it could cause.,10
2010-04-22,oba,And much of the discussion here at the center was focused on if we and when we have to deal with these mitigation efforts.,7
2010-04-22,oba,"Thus far, as you can tell, the weather has not been as cooperative as we'd like on this front.",5
2010-04-22,oba,But we're going to continue to push forward.,3
2010-04-22,oba,I also want to stress that we are working closely with the Gulf States and local communities to help every American affected by this crisis.,8
2010-04-22,oba,So let me be clear: BP is responsible for this leak; BP will be paying the bill.,5
2010-04-22,oba,"But as President of the United States, I'm going to spare no effort to respond to this crisis for as long as it continues.",7
2010-04-22,oba,And we will spare no resource to clean up whatever damage is caused.,4
2010-04-22,oba,"And while there will be time to fully investigate what happened on that rig and hold responsible parties accountable, our focus now is on a fully coordinated, relentless response effort to stop the leak and prevent more damage to the Gulf.",8
2010-04-22,oba,"I want to thank the thousands of Americans who've been working around the clock to stop this crisis, whether it's the brave men and women of our military or the local officials who call the Gulf home.",8
2010-04-22,oba,"They are doing everything in their power to mitigate this disaster, prevent damage to our environment, and help our fellow citizens.",5
2010-04-22,oba,"And during this visit, I am hoping to have the opportunity to speak with some of the individuals who are directly affected by the disaster.",11
2010-04-22,oba,"I've heard already that people are, understandably, frustrated and frightened, especially because the people of this region have been through worse disasters than anybody should have to bear.",6
2010-04-22,oba,"But every American affected by this spill should know this: Your Government will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to stop this crisis.",6
2010-04-22,oba,"This is one of the richest and most beautiful ecosystems on the planet, and for centuries, its residents have enjoyed and made a living off the fish that swim in these waters and the wildlife that inhabit these shores.",8
2010-04-22,oba,This is also the heartbeat of the region's economic life.,5
2010-04-22,oba,"And we're going to do everything in our power to protect our natural resources, compensate those who have been harmed, rebuild what has been damaged, and help this region persevere like it has done so many times before.",8
2010-04-22,oba,"That's a commitment I'm making as President of the United States, and I know that everybody who works for the Federal Government feels the exact same way.",7
2010-04-22,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2010-05-07,oba,All right.,1
2010-05-07,oba,"Good morning, everybody.",2
2010-05-07,oba,"On what seems like a daily basis, we're barraged with statistics and forecasts and reports and data related to the health of the economy.",8
2010-05-07,oba,"But from the first days of this administration, amidst the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, I've said that the truest measure of progress would be whether or not we were creating jobs.",5
2010-05-07,oba,That's what matters in people's lives.,5
2010-05-07,oba,"What matters is whether someone who needs a job can find work, whether people can provide for their families and save for the future and achieve some measure of economic security.",8
2010-05-07,oba,Everything we've done has been with this goal in mind.,3
2010-05-07,oba,And today I'm happy to report that we received some very encouraging news.,6
2010-05-07,oba,"In April, the economy added 290,000 jobs, with the vast majority, approximately 230,000, coming from the private sector.",6
2010-05-07,oba,This is the largest monthly increase in 4 years.,4
2010-05-07,oba,"And we created 121,000 more jobs in February and March than previously estimated, which means we've now seen job growth for 4 months in a row.",8
2010-05-07,oba,"These numbers are particularly heartening when you consider where we were a year ago, with an economy in freefall.",5
2010-05-07,oba,"At the height of the downturn, around the time that I took office, we were losing an average of 750,000 jobs per month.",5
2010-05-07,oba,"So this news comes on the heels of a report last week that the overall output of our economy, our GDP, is increasing.",5
2010-05-07,oba,We now know that the economy has been growing for the better part of a year.,6
2010-05-07,oba,And this steady growth is starting to give businesses the confidence to expand and to hire new people.,6
2010-05-07,oba,I should also note that the unemployment rate ticked up slightly from 9.7 to 9.9.,4
2010-05-07,oba,"Given the strength of these job numbers, this may seem contradictory, but this increase is largely a reflection of the fact that workers who had dropped out of the workforce entirely are now seeing jobs again and--are now seeking jobs again, encouraged by better prospects.",11
2010-05-07,oba,"Now, I want to emphasize, the economic crisis we've faced has inflicted a lot of damage on families and businesses across our country, and it's going to take time to repair and rebuild.",8
2010-05-07,oba,"Over the course of this recession, more than 8 million jobs were lost.",5
2010-05-07,oba,So there are a lot of people out there who are still experiencing real hardship.,5
2010-05-07,oba,"And we've got to be mindful that today's job numbers, while welcome, leave us with a lot of work to do.",5
2010-05-07,oba,It's going to take time to achieve the strong and sustained job growth that is necessary.,5
2010-05-07,oba,"And of course, long before this recession hit, for a decade, middle class families had been experiencing a sense of declining economic security.",4
2010-05-07,oba,"So yes, we've got a ways to go.",3
2010-05-07,oba,But we've also come a very long way.,3
2010-05-07,oba,"And we can see that the difficult and, at times, unpopular steps that we've taken over the past year are making a difference.",5
2010-05-07,oba,Productivity is up.,1
2010-05-07,oba,The hours people are working are up.,3
2010-05-07,oba,Both are signs the company may be hiring more workers in the months to come.,5
2010-05-07,oba,We saw the largest increase in manufacturing employment since 1998.,4
2010-05-07,oba,"And we can see the benefits of our Recovery Act in the strong employment reports from construction and other sectors, where we've made key investments in creating and saving jobs.",11
2010-05-07,oba,"Of course, there are limits to what the Government can do.",5
2010-05-07,oba,The true engine of job growth in this country will always be the private sector.,6
2010-05-07,oba,That's why we are very pleased to see the strong employment growth on the private sector side.,7
2010-05-07,oba,What Government can do is help create the conditions for companies to hire again.,5
2010-05-07,oba,"What it can do is build the infrastructure and offer the incentives that will allow small businesses to add workers, that will help entrepreneurs take a chance on an idea, that will lead manufacturers to set up shop not overseas, but right here in United States of America.",8
2010-05-07,oba,And that's what we've been doing.,2
2010-05-07,oba,Right now a series of tax incentives and other steps to promote hiring are taking effect.,5
2010-05-07,oba,"Because of a bill I signed into law a few weeks ago, businesses are now eligible for tax cuts for hiring unemployed workers.",7
2010-05-07,oba,Companies are also able to write off more of their investments in new equipment.,6
2010-05-07,oba,"And we're spurring additional investments in school renovation, clean energy projects, and road construction, which will create jobs while laying a new foundation for lasting growth.",7
2010-05-07,oba,"In addition, as part of health reform, 4 million small businesses recently received a postcard in their mailbox telling them that they're eligible for a health care tax cut this year.",8
2010-05-07,oba,"It's worth perhaps tens of thousands of dollars to each of these companies, and it will provide welcome relief to small-business owners, who too often have to choose between health care and hiring.",8
2010-05-07,oba,So that's what's already come on line.,3
2010-05-07,oba,But we still have more to do.,3
2010-05-07,oba,"In my State of the Union Address, I called for a $30 billion small-business lending fund, which would help increase the flow of credit to small companies that were hit hard by the decline in lending that followed the financial crisis.",13
2010-05-07,oba,"And, obviously, small businesses are a major source of job creation.",4
2010-05-07,oba,"This morning we sent draft legislation to Congress on this fund, which now includes a new State small-business credit initiative.",6
2010-05-07,oba,"This State initiative, which was designed with the help of Governors and Members of both the House and the Senate, will help expand lending for small businesses and manufacturers at a time when budget shortfalls are leading States to cut back on vitally important lending programs.",11
2010-05-07,oba,"In addition, with State and local governments facing huge budget gaps, we're seeing layoffs of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other essential public servants, which not only harms the economy, but also the community and the economy as a whole.",7
2010-05-07,oba,"So we are working with Congress to find ways to keep our teachers in the classrooms, the police officers on the beat, and firefighters on call.",6
2010-05-07,oba,"A few months ago, I also proposed giving people rebates to upgrade the energy efficiencies of their home.",7
2010-05-07,oba,"This will not only save families money, it will create jobs in hard-hit construction and manufacturing sectors, since things like windows and insulation are overwhelmingly made in the United States of America.",6
2010-05-07,oba,"I was gratified to see a bipartisan vote to pass this proposal, called Home Star, in the House of Representatives yesterday.",7
2010-05-07,oba,I'm calling on the Senate to act as well.,3
2010-05-07,oba,"And I'm urging Congress to expand the clean energy manufacturing tax credit, which is helping create jobs across America building wind turbines and solar panels.",9
2010-05-07,oba,"Even as we take these steps to increase hiring in the short and long run, we're also mindful of other economic factors that can emerge.",7
2010-05-07,oba,So I want to speak to the unusual market activity that took place yesterday on Wall Street.,7
2010-05-07,oba,"The regulatory authorities are evaluating this closely, with a concern for protecting investors and preventing this from happening again.",8
2010-05-07,oba,"And they will make findings of their review public, along with recommendations for appropriate action.",6
2010-05-07,oba,I also spoke this morning with German Chancellor Merkel regarding economic and financial developments in Europe.,4
2010-05-07,oba,We agreed on the importance of a strong policy response by the affected countries and a strong financial response from the international community.,10
2010-05-07,oba,I made clear that the United States supports these efforts and will continue to cooperate with European authorities and the IMF during this critical period.,8
2010-05-07,oba,"So this week's job numbers come as a relief to Americans who found a job, but it offers, obviously, little comfort to those who are still out of work.",8
2010-05-07,oba,"So to those who are out there still looking, I give you my word that I'm going to keep fighting every single day to create jobs and opportunities for people.",7
2010-05-07,oba,Every one of my team that's standing alongside me here has the same sense of mission.,4
2010-05-07,oba,We're not going to rest until we've put this difficult chapter behind us.,3
2010-05-07,oba,"And I won't rest until you, and millions of your neighbors caught up in these storms, are able to find a good job and reach a brighter day.",6
2010-05-07,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2010-07-15,oba,Good evening.,1
2010-07-15,oba,"As we speak, our nation faces a multitude of challenges.",3
2010-07-15,oba,"At home, our top priority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched the lives of nearly every American.",10
2010-07-15,oba,"Abroad, our brave men and women in uniform are taking the fight to al Qaeda wherever it exists.",3
2010-07-15,oba,"And tonight, I’ve returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast to speak with you about the battle we’re waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens.",10
2010-07-15,oba,"On April 20th, an explosion ripped through BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, about 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana.",4
2010-07-15,oba,Eleven workers lost their lives.,2
2010-07-15,oba,Seventeen others were injured.,2
2010-07-15,oba,"And soon, nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean, oil began spewing into the water.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"Because there has never been a leak this size at this depth, stopping it has tested the limits of human technology.",6
2010-07-15,oba,"That’s why just after the rig sank, I assembled a team of our nation’s best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge -- a team led by Dr. Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and our nation’s Secretary of Energy.",9
2010-07-15,oba,Scientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies have also provided ideas and advice.,7
2010-07-15,oba,"As a result of these efforts, we’ve directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"And in the coming weeks and days, these efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the oil leaking out of the well.",5
2010-07-15,oba,This is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that’s expected to stop the leak completely.,7
2010-07-15,oba,"Already, this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced.",3
2010-07-15,oba,"And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane, it’s not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days.",8
2010-07-15,oba,"The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic, one that we will be fighting for months and even years.",8
2010-07-15,oba,But make no mistake:  We will fight this spill with everything we’ve got for as long as it takes.,7
2010-07-15,oba,We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused.,6
2010-07-15,oba,And we will do whatever’s necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy.,5
2010-07-15,oba,"Tonight I’d like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward:  what we’re doing to clean up the oil, what we’re doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf, and what we’re doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again.",8
2010-07-15,oba,"First, the cleanup.",1
2010-07-15,oba,"From the very beginning of this crisis, the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation’s history -- an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen, who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters.",9
2010-07-15,oba,"We now have nearly 30,000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil.",6
2010-07-15,oba,Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf.,5
2010-07-15,oba,"And I’ve authorized the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard members along the coast.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore, they’re ready to help clean the beaches, train response workers, or even help with processing claims -- and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible.",7
2010-07-15,oba,"Because of our efforts, millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning, skimming and other collection methods.",5
2010-07-15,oba,Over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil.,4
2010-07-15,oba,"We’ve approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reaches the shore, and we’re working with Alabama, Mississippi and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"As the cleanup continues, we will offer whatever additional resources and assistance our coastal states may need.",3
2010-07-15,oba,"Now, a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect, and new challenges will always arise.",4
2010-07-15,oba,I saw and heard evidence of that during this trip.,4
2010-07-15,oba,"So if something isn’t working, we want to hear about it.",3
2010-07-15,oba,"If there are problems in the operation, we will fix them.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"But we have to recognize that despite our best efforts, oil has already caused damage to our coastline and its wildlife.",7
2010-07-15,oba,"And sadly, no matter how effective our response is, there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done.",4
2010-07-15,oba,That’s why the second thing we’re focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast.,5
2010-07-15,oba,"You know, for generations, men and women who call this region home have made their living from the water.",4
2010-07-15,oba,That living is now in jeopardy.,2
2010-07-15,oba,I’ve talked to shrimpers and fishermen who don’t know how they’re going to support their families this year.,8
2010-07-15,oba,I’ve seen empty docks and restaurants with fewer customers -- even in areas where the beaches are not yet affected.,5
2010-07-15,oba,I’ve talked to owners of shops and hotels who wonder when the tourists might start coming back.,8
2010-07-15,oba,The sadness and the anger they feel is not just about the money they’ve lost.,4
2010-07-15,oba,It’s about a wrenching anxiety that their way of life may be lost.,6
2010-07-15,oba,I refuse to let that happen.,3
2010-07-15,oba,"Tomorrow, I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company’s recklessness.",13
2010-07-15,oba,And this fund will not be controlled by BP.,2
2010-07-15,oba,"In order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner, the account must and will be administered by an independent third party.",8
2010-07-15,oba,"Beyond compensating the people of the Gulf in the short term, it’s also clear we need a long-term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region.",7
2010-07-15,oba,The oil spill represents just the latest blow to a place that’s already suffered multiple economic disasters and decades of environmental degradation that has led to disappearing wetlands and habitats.,13
2010-07-15,oba,And the region still hasn’t recovered from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.,3
2010-07-15,oba,That’s why we must make a commitment to the Gulf Coast that goes beyond responding to the crisis of the moment.,10
2010-07-15,oba,I make that commitment tonight.,2
2010-07-15,oba,"Earlier, I asked Ray Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy, who is also a former governor of Mississippi and a son of the Gulf Coast, to develop a long-term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible.",8
2010-07-15,oba,"The plan will be designed by states, local communities, tribes, fishermen, businesses, conservationists and other Gulf residents.",9
2010-07-15,oba,And BP will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region.,6
2010-07-15,oba,The third part of our response plan is the steps we’re taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again.,7
2010-07-15,oba,"A few months ago, I approved a proposal to consider new, limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe -- that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken.",8
2010-07-15,oba,"That obviously was not the case in the Deepwater Horizon rig, and I want to know why.",5
2010-07-15,oba,The American people deserve to know why.,2
2010-07-15,oba,The families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion -- these families deserve to know why.,5
2010-07-15,oba,And so I’ve established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place.,7
2010-07-15,oba,"Already, I’ve issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling.",4
2010-07-15,oba,"I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs, but for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue.",8
2010-07-15,oba,"And while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible, I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"One place we’ve already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits, known as the Minerals Management Service.",11
2010-07-15,oba,"Over the last decade, this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility -- a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves.",14
2010-07-15,oba,"At this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"When Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior, one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency.",7
2010-07-15,oba,"But it’s now clear that the problem there ran much deeper, and the pace of reform was just too slow.",4
2010-07-15,oba,"And so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency -- Michael Bromwich, who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General.",7
2010-07-15,oba,And his charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry’s watchdog -- not its partner.,7
2010-07-15,oba,"So one of the lessons we’ve learned from this spill is that we need better regulations, better safety standards, and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling.",7
2010-07-15,oba,"But a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry, drilling for oil these days entails greater risk.",7
2010-07-15,oba,"After all, oil is a finite resource.",2
2010-07-15,oba,"We consume more than 20 percent of the world’s oil, but have less than 2 percent of the world’s oil reserves.",6
2010-07-15,oba,And that’s part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean -- because we’re running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water.,9
2010-07-15,oba,"For decades, we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered.",6
2010-07-15,oba,"For decades, we’ve talked and talked about the need to end America’s century-long addiction to fossil fuels.",7
2010-07-15,oba,"And for decades, we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires.",6
2010-07-15,oba,"Time and again, the path forward has been blocked -- not only by oil industry lobbyists, but also by a lack of political courage and candor.",6
2010-07-15,oba,The consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight.,4
2010-07-15,oba,Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be right here in America.,6
2010-07-15,oba,"Each day, we send nearly $1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil.",4
2010-07-15,oba,"And today, as we look to the Gulf, we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude.",9
2010-07-15,oba,We cannot consign our children to this future.,3
2010-07-15,oba,The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now.,6
2010-07-15,oba,Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash America’s innovation and seize control of our own destiny.,10
2010-07-15,oba,This is not some distant vision for America.,3
2010-07-15,oba,"The transition away from fossil fuels is going to take some time, but over the last year and a half, we’ve already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"As we speak, old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines, people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows, and small businesses are making solar panels.",7
2010-07-15,oba,"Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks, and families are making their homes more energy-efficient.",4
2010-07-15,oba,Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries.,5
2010-07-15,oba,Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us.,8
2010-07-15,oba,"As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs -- but only if we accelerate that transition.",6
2010-07-15,oba,Only if we seize the moment.,2
2010-07-15,oba,And only if we rally together and act as one nation -- workers and entrepreneurs; scientists and citizens; the public and private sectors.,5
2010-07-15,oba,"When I was a candidate for this office, I laid out a set of principles that would move our country towards energy independence.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"Last year, the House of Representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill -- a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America’s businesses.",12
2010-07-15,oba,"Now, there are costs associated with this transition.",5
2010-07-15,oba,And there are some who believe that we can’t afford those costs right now.,5
2010-07-15,oba,"I say we can’t afford not to change how we produce and use energy --because the long-term costs to our economy, our national security, and our environment are far greater.",5
2010-07-15,oba,So I’m happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party -- as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels.,8
2010-07-15,oba,Some have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks.,5
2010-07-15,oba,Some believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power.,7
2010-07-15,oba,Others wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high-tech industry does on research and development -- and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development.,7
2010-07-15,oba,"All of these approaches have merit, and deserve a fair hearing in the months ahead.",4
2010-07-15,oba,But the one approach I will not accept is inaction.,3
2010-07-15,oba,The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is somehow too big and too difficult to meet.,6
2010-07-15,oba,"You know, the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War II.",7
2010-07-15,oba,The same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon.,9
2010-07-15,oba,"And yet, time and again, we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom.",6
2010-07-15,oba,"Instead, what has defined us as a nation since our founding is the capacity to shape our destiny -- our determination to fight for the America we want for our children.",5
2010-07-15,oba,Even if we’re unsure exactly what that looks like.,4
2010-07-15,oba,Even if we don’t yet know precisely how we’re going to get there.,3
2010-07-15,oba,We know we’ll get there.,2
2010-07-15,oba,It’s a faith in the future that sustains us as a people.,7
2010-07-15,oba,It is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the Gulf right now.,5
2010-07-15,oba,"Each year, at the beginning of shrimping season, the region’s fishermen take part in a tradition that was brought to America long ago by fishing immigrants from Europe.",7
2010-07-15,oba,"It’s called “The Blessing of the Fleet,” and today it’s a celebration where clergy from different religions gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the men and women who will soon head out to sea -- some for weeks at a time.",12
2010-07-15,oba,The ceremony goes on in good times and in bad.,3
2010-07-15,oba,"It took place after Katrina, and it took place a few weeks ago -- at the beginning of the most difficult season these fishermen have ever faced.",8
2010-07-15,oba,"And still, they came and they prayed.",2
2010-07-15,oba,"For as a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition, “The blessing is not that God has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers.",5
2010-07-15,oba,"The blessing is that He is with us always,” a blessing that’s granted “even in the midst of the storm.”

The oil spill is not the last crisis America will face.",7
2010-07-15,oba,This nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again.,2
2010-07-15,oba,"What sees us through -- what has always seen us through -- is our strength, our resilience, and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it.",6
2010-07-15,oba,"Tonight, we pray for that courage.",3
2010-07-15,oba,We pray for the people of the Gulf.,5
2010-07-15,oba,And we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day.,4
2010-07-15,oba,"Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.",5
2010-07-21,oba,Thank you.,1
2010-07-21,oba,"Everybody, please have a seat, have a seat.",3
2010-07-21,oba,"Well, good morning, everyone.",1
2010-07-21,oba,"We are gathered in the heart of our nation’s capital, surrounded by memorials to leaders and citizens who served our nation in its earliest days and in its days of greatest trial.",12
2010-07-21,oba,Today is such a time for America.,3
2010-07-21,oba,"Over the past two years, we have faced the worst recession since the Great Depression.",4
2010-07-21,oba,Eight million people lost their jobs.,3
2010-07-21,oba,Tens of millions saw the value of their homes and retirement savings plummet.,6
2010-07-21,oba,Countless businesses have been unable to get the loans they need and many have been forced to shut their doors.,5
2010-07-21,oba,"And although the economy is growing again, too many people are still feeling the pain of the downturn.",4
2010-07-21,oba,"Now, while a number of factors led to such a severe recession, the primary cause was a breakdown in our financial system.",4
2010-07-21,oba,It was a crisis born of a failure of responsibility from certain corners of Wall Street to the halls of power in Washington.,11
2010-07-21,oba,"For years, our financial sector was governed by antiquated and poorly enforced rules that allowed some to game the system and take risks that endangered the entire economy.",9
2010-07-21,oba,Unscrupulous lenders locked consumers into complex loans with hidden costs.,5
2010-07-21,oba,"Firms like AIG placed massive, risky bets with borrowed money.",3
2010-07-21,oba,"And while the rules left abuse and excess unchecked, they also left taxpayers on the hook if a big bank or financial institution ever failed.",4
2010-07-21,oba,"Now, even before the crisis hit, I went to Wall Street and I called for common-sense reforms to protect consumers and our economy as a whole.",5
2010-07-21,oba,"And soon after taking office, I proposed a set of reforms to empower consumers and investors, to bring the shadowy deals that caused this crisis into the light of day, and to put a stop to taxpayer bailouts once and for all.",7
2010-07-21,oba,"Today, thanks to a lot of people in this room, those reforms will become the law of the land.",6
2010-07-21,oba,"For the last year, Chairmen Barney Frank and Chris Dodd have worked day and night.",3
2010-07-21,oba,Barney and Chris have worked day and night to bring about this reform.,3
2010-07-21,oba,And I am profoundly grateful to them.,3
2010-07-21,oba,I would be remiss if I didn't also express my appreciation to Senator Harry Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi for their leadership.,5
2010-07-21,oba,It wouldn’t have happened without them.,2
2010-07-21,oba,Passing this bill was no easy task.,3
2010-07-21,oba,"To get there, we had to overcome the furious lobbying of an array of powerful interest groups and a partisan minority determined to block change.",8
2010-07-21,oba,"So the members who are here today, both on the stage and in the audience, they have done a great service in devoting so much time and expertise to this effort, to looking out for the public interests and not the special interests.",6
2010-07-21,oba,"And I also want to thank the three Republican senators who put partisanship aside, judged this bill on the merits, and voted for reform.",5
2010-07-21,oba,We’re grateful to them.,3
2010-07-21,oba,And the Republican House members.,2
2010-07-21,oba,"Good to see you, Joe.",2
2010-07-21,oba,"Now, let’s put this in perspective.",3
2010-07-21,oba,"The fact is, the financial industry is central to our nation’s ability to grow, to prosper, to compete and to innovate.",9
2010-07-21,oba,"There are a lot of banks that understand and fulfill this vital role, and there are a whole lot of bankers who want to do right -- and do right -- by their customers.",7
2010-07-21,oba,"This reform will help foster innovation, not hamper it.",2
2010-07-21,oba,"It is designed to make sure that everybody follows the same set of rules, so that firms compete on price and quality, not on tricks and not on traps.",6
2010-07-21,oba,It demands accountability and responsibility from everyone.,2
2010-07-21,oba,"It provides certainty to everybody, from bankers to farmers to business owners to consumers.",4
2010-07-21,oba,"And unless your business model depends on cutting corners or bilking your customers, you’ve got nothing to fear from reform.",6
2010-07-21,oba,"Now, for all those Americans who are wondering what Wall Street reform means for you, here’s what you can expect.",7
2010-07-21,oba,"If you’ve ever applied for a credit card, a student loan, or a mortgage, you know the feeling of signing your name to pages of barely understandable fine print.",9
2010-07-21,oba,"What often happens as a result is that many Americans are caught by hidden fees and penalties, or saddled with loans they can’t afford.",6
2010-07-21,oba,"That’s what happened to Robin Fox, hit with a massive rate increase on her credit card balance even though she paid her bills on time.",7
2010-07-21,oba,"That’s what happened to Andrew Giordano, who discovered hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees on his bank statement -- fees he had no idea he might face.",10
2010-07-21,oba,Both are here today.,1
2010-07-21,oba,"Well, with this law, unfair rate hikes, like the one that hit Robin, will end for good.",6
2010-07-21,oba,And we’ll ensure that people like Andrew aren’t unwittingly caught by overdraft fees when they sign up for a checking account.,5
2010-07-21,oba,"With this law, we’ll crack down on abusive practices in the mortgage industry.",5
2010-07-21,oba,We’ll make sure that contracts are simpler -- putting an end to many hidden penalties and fees in complex mortgages -- so folks know what they’re signing.,7
2010-07-21,oba,"With this law, students who take out college loans will be provided clear and concise information about their obligations.",4
2010-07-21,oba,"And with this law, ordinary investors -- like seniors and folks saving for retirement -- will be able to receive more information about the costs and risks of mutual funds and other investment products, so that they can make better financial decisions as to what will work for them.",9
2010-07-21,oba,"So, all told, these reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history.",3
2010-07-21,oba,In history.,1
2010-07-21,oba,"And these protections will be enforced by a new consumer watchdog with just one job:  looking out for people -- not big banks, not lenders, not investment houses -- looking out for people as they interact with the financial system.",9
2010-07-21,oba,And that’s not just good for consumers; that’s good for the economy.,4
2010-07-21,oba,Because reform will put a stop to a lot of the bad loans that fueled a debt-based bubble.,8
2010-07-21,oba,"And it will mean all companies will have to seek customers by offering better products, instead of more deceptive ones.",6
2010-07-21,oba,"Now, beyond the consumer protections I’ve outlined, reform will also rein in the abuse and excess that nearly brought down our financial system.",4
2010-07-21,oba,It will finally bring transparency to the kinds of complex and risky transactions that helped trigger the financial crisis.,8
2010-07-21,oba,"Shareholders will also have a greater say on the pay of CEOs and other executives, so they can reward success instead of failure.",7
2010-07-21,oba,"And finally, because of this law, the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street’s mistakes.",6
2010-07-21,oba,There will be no more tax-funded bailouts -- period.,3
2010-07-21,oba,"If a large financial institution should ever fail, this reform gives us the ability to wind it down without endangering the broader economy.",6
2010-07-21,oba,"And there will be new rules to make clear that no firm is somehow protected because it is “too big to fail,” so we don’t have another AIG.",7
2010-07-21,oba,That's what this reform will mean.,3
2010-07-21,oba,"Now, it doesn’t mean our work is over.",3
2010-07-21,oba,"For these new rules to be effective, regulators will have to be vigilant.",3
2010-07-21,oba,We may need to make adjustments along the way as our financial system adapts to these new changes and changes around the globe.,7
2010-07-21,oba,No law can force anybody to be responsible; it’s still incumbent on those on Wall Street to heed the lessons of this crisis in terms of how they conduct their businesses.,7
2010-07-21,oba,The fact is every American -- from Main Street to Wall Street -- has a stake in our financial system.,6
2010-07-21,oba,Wall Street banks and firms invest the capital that makes it possible for start-ups to sell new products.,6
2010-07-21,oba,They provide loans to businesses to expand and to hire.,5
2010-07-21,oba,They back mortgages for families purchasing a new home.,6
2010-07-21,oba,That’s why we’ll all stand to gain from these reforms.,5
2010-07-21,oba,We all win when investors around the world have confidence in our markets.,5
2010-07-21,oba,We all win when shareholders have more power and more information.,4
2010-07-21,oba,We all win when consumers are protected against abuse.,3
2010-07-21,oba,"And we all win when folks are rewarded based on how well they perform, not how well they evade accountability.",7
2010-07-21,oba,"In the end, our financial system only works -- our market is only free -- when there are clear rules and basic safeguards that prevent abuse, that check excess, that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system.",8
2010-07-21,oba,"And that’s what these reforms are designed to achieve -- no more, no less.",3
2010-07-21,oba,"Because that’s how we will ensure that our economy works for consumers, that it works for investors, that it works for financial institutions -- that it works for all of us.",5
2010-07-21,oba,This is the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history.,5
2010-07-21,oba,"Ultimately, there’s no dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street.",5
2010-07-21,oba,We rise or fall together as one nation.,4
2010-07-21,oba,"So these reforms will help lift our economy and lead all of us to a stronger, more prosperous future.",6
2010-07-21,oba,"And that’s why I’m so honored to sign these reforms into law, and I’m so grateful to everybody who worked so hard to make this day possible.",9
2010-07-21,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2010-07-26,oba,"Good afternoon, everybody.",2
2010-07-26,oba,I just concluded a productive discussion with the leaders of both parties in Congress.,7
2010-07-26,oba,"This was one of a series of regular meetings that I called for in the State of the Union because I think it's important for us to come together and speak frankly about the challenges we face and to work through areas where we don't agree; hopefully, find some areas where we do.",12
2010-07-26,oba,"Our conversation today focused on an issue that's being discussed every day at kitchen tables across this country, and that's how do we create jobs that people need to support their families.",8
2010-07-26,oba,I believe that starts with doing everything we can to support small businesses.,6
2010-07-26,oba,"These are the stores, the restaurants, the startups, and other companies that create two out of every three new jobs in this country and that grow into the big businesses that transform industries here in America and around the world.",14
2010-07-26,oba,But we know that many of these businesses still can't get the loans and the capital they need to keep their doors open and hire new workers.,9
2010-07-26,oba,"That's why we've proposed steps to get them that help: eliminating capital gains taxes on investments, making it easier for small lenders to support small businesses, expanding successful SBA programs to help these businesses access the capital that they need.",11
2010-07-26,oba,"This is how we create jobs, by investing in the innovators and entrepreneurs that have always driven our prosperity.",8
2010-07-26,oba,"These are the kind of commonsense steps that folks from both parties have supported in the past, steps to cut taxes and spur private sector growth and investment.",8
2010-07-26,oba,"And I hope that in the coming days, we'll once again find common ground and get this legislation passed.",5
2010-07-26,oba,We shouldn't let America's small businesses be held hostage to partisan politics and certainly not at this critical time.,4
2010-07-26,oba,We also talked about the need to move forward on energy reform.,6
2010-07-26,oba,"The Senate is now poised to act before the August recess, advancing legislation to respond to the BP oil spill and create new clean energy jobs.",6
2010-07-26,oba,"That legislation is an important step in the right direction, but I want to emphasize it's only the first step.",5
2010-07-26,oba,"And I intend to keep pushing for broader reform, including climate legislation, because if we've learned anything from the tragedy in the Gulf, it's that our current energy policy is unsustainable.",7
2010-07-26,oba,"And we can't afford to stand by as our dependence on foreign oil deepens, as we keep on pumping out the deadly pollutants that threaten our air and our water and the lives and livelihoods of our people.",10
2010-07-26,oba,And we can't stand by as we let China race ahead to create the clean energy jobs and industries of the future.,7
2010-07-26,oba,"We should be developing those renewable energy resources and creating those high-wage, high-skill jobs right here in the United States of America.",6
2010-07-26,oba,That's what comprehensive energy and climate reform would do.,4
2010-07-26,oba,And that's why I intend to keep pushing this issue forward.,5
2010-07-26,oba,I also urged the House leaders to pass the necessary funding to support our efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan.,7
2010-07-26,oba,I know much has been written about this in recent days as a result of the substantial leak of documents from Afghanistan covering a period from 2004 to 2009.,8
2010-07-26,oba,"While I'm concerned about the disclosure of sensitive information from the battlefield that could potentially jeopardize individuals or operations, the fact is, these documents don't reveal any issues that haven't already informed our public debate on Afghanistan.",11
2010-07-26,oba,"Indeed, they point to the same challenges that led me to conduct an extensive review of our policy last fall.",8
2010-07-26,oba,"So let me underscore what I've said many times: For 7 years, we failed to implement a strategy adequate to the challenge in this region, the region from which the 9/11 attacks were waged and other attacks against the United States and our friends and allies have been planned.",9
2010-07-26,oba,"That's why we've substantially increased our commitment there, insisted upon greater accountability from our partners in Afghanistan and Pakistan, developed a new strategy that can work, and put in place a team, including one of our finest generals, to execute that plan.",10
2010-07-26,oba,Now we have to see that strategy through.,3
2010-07-26,oba,"And as I told the leaders, I hope the House will act today to join the Senate, which voted unanimously in favor of this funding, to ensure that our troops have the resources they need and that we're able to do what's necessary for our national security.",10
2010-07-26,oba,"Finally, during our meeting today, I urged Senator McConnell and others in the Senate to work with us to fill the vacancies that continue to plague our judiciary.",7
2010-07-26,oba,Right now we've got nominees who've been waiting up to 8 months to be confirmed as judges.,5
2010-07-26,oba,Most of these folks were voted out of committee unanimously or nearly unanimously by both Democrats and Republicans.,4
2010-07-26,oba,Both Democrats and Republicans agreed that they were qualified to serve.,4
2010-07-26,oba,"Nevertheless, some in the minority have used parliamentary procedures time and again to deny them a vote in the full Senate.",5
2010-07-26,oba,"Now, if we want our judicial system to work, if we want to deliver justice in our courts, then we need judges on our benches.",5
2010-07-26,oba,"And I hope that in the coming months, we'll be able to work together to ensure a timelier process in the Senate.",8
2010-07-26,oba,"Now, we don't have many days left before Congress is out for the year.",7
2010-07-26,oba,And everyone understands that we're less than 100 days from an election.,4
2010-07-26,oba,It's during this time that the noise and the chatter about who's up in the polls and which party is ahead threatens to drown out just about everything else.,8
2010-07-26,oba,But the folks we serve--who sent us here to serve--they sent us here for a reason.,4
2010-07-26,oba,They sent us here to listen to their voices.,4
2010-07-26,oba,"They sent us here to represent their interests, not our own.",4
2010-07-26,oba,They sent us here to lead.,2
2010-07-26,oba,"And I hope that in the coming months, we'll do everything in our power to live up to that responsibility.",5
2010-07-26,oba,Thanks very much.,2
2010-08-31,oba,Good evening.,1
2010-08-31,oba,"Tonight, I’d like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in Iraq, the ongoing security challenges we face, and the need to rebuild our nation here at home.",7
2010-08-31,oba,I know this historic moment comes at a time of great uncertainty for many Americans.,8
2010-08-31,oba,We’ve now been through nearly a decade of war.,4
2010-08-31,oba,We’ve endured a long and painful recession.,3
2010-08-31,oba,"And sometimes in the midst of these storms, the future that we’re trying to build for our nation -- a future of lasting peace and long-term prosperity -- may seem beyond our reach.",7
2010-08-31,oba,But this milestone should serve as a reminder to all Americans that the future is ours to shape if we move forward with confidence and commitment.,6
2010-08-31,oba,It should also serve as a message to the world that the United States of America intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century.,8
2010-08-31,oba,"From this desk, seven and a half years ago, President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq.",5
2010-08-31,oba,Much has changed since that night.,3
2010-08-31,oba,A war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency.,4
2010-08-31,oba,Terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart.,3
2010-08-31,oba,Thousands of Americans gave their lives; tens of thousands have been wounded.,4
2010-08-31,oba,Our relations abroad were strained.,2
2010-08-31,oba,Our unity at home was tested.,3
2010-08-31,oba,These are the rough waters encountered during the course of one of America’s longest wars.,10
2010-08-31,oba,Yet there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides.,3
2010-08-31,oba,"At every turn, America’s men and women in uniform have served with courage and resolve.",3
2010-08-31,oba,"As Commander-in-Chief, I am incredibly proud of their service.",4
2010-08-31,oba,"And like all Americans, I’m awed by their sacrifice, and by the sacrifices of their families.",5
2010-08-31,oba,The Americans who have served in Iraq completed every mission they were given.,4
2010-08-31,oba,They defeated a regime that had terrorized its people.,4
2010-08-31,oba,"Together with Iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own, our troops fought block by block to help Iraq seize the chance for a better future.",7
2010-08-31,oba,"They shifted tactics to protect the Iraqi people, trained Iraqi Security Forces, and took out terrorist leaders.",4
2010-08-31,oba,"Because of our troops and civilians -- and because of the resilience of the Iraqi people -- Iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny, even though many challenges remain.",6
2010-08-31,oba,"So tonight, I am announcing that the American combat mission in Iraq has ended.",4
2010-08-31,oba,"Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.",7
2010-08-31,oba,This was my pledge to the American people as a candidate for this office.,6
2010-08-31,oba,"Last February, I announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of Iraq, while redoubling our efforts to strengthen Iraq’s Security Forces and support its government and people.",8
2010-08-31,oba,That’s what we’ve done.,2
2010-08-31,oba,"We’ve removed nearly 100,000 U.S. troops from Iraq.",3
2010-08-31,oba,We’ve closed or transferred to the Iraqis hundreds of bases.,5
2010-08-31,oba,And we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of Iraq.,5
2010-08-31,oba,This completes a transition to Iraqi responsibility for their own security.,6
2010-08-31,oba,"U.S. troops pulled out of Iraq’s cities last summer, and Iraqi forces have moved into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens.",8
2010-08-31,oba,"Even as Iraq continues to suffer terrorist attacks, security incidents have been near the lowest on record since the war began.",4
2010-08-31,oba,"And Iraqi forces have taken the fight to al Qaeda, removing much of its leadership in Iraqi-led operations.",8
2010-08-31,oba,This year also saw Iraq hold credible elections that drew a strong turnout.,5
2010-08-31,oba,A caretaker administration is in place as Iraqis form a government based on the results of that election.,8
2010-08-31,oba,"Tonight, I encourage Iraq’s leaders to move forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that is just, representative, and accountable to the Iraqi people.",11
2010-08-31,oba,"And when that government is in place, there should be no doubt:  The Iraqi people will have a strong partner in the United States.",7
2010-08-31,oba,"Our combat mission is ending, but our commitment to Iraq’s future is not.",6
2010-08-31,oba,"Going forward, a transitional force of U.S. troops will remain in Iraq with a different mission:  advising and assisting Iraq’s Security Forces, supporting Iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilians.",8
2010-08-31,oba,"Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all U.S. troops will leave by the end of next year.",6
2010-08-31,oba,"As our military draws down, our dedicated civilians -- diplomats, aid workers, and advisors -- are moving into the lead to support Iraq as it strengthens its government, resolves political disputes, resettles those displaced by war, and builds ties with the region and the world.",7
2010-08-31,oba,That’s a message that Vice President Biden is delivering to the Iraqi people through his visit there today.,5
2010-08-31,oba,This new approach reflects our long-term partnership with Iraq -- one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect.,7
2010-08-31,oba,"Of course, violence will not end with our combat mission.",3
2010-08-31,oba,"Extremists will continue to set off bombs, attack Iraqi civilians and try to spark sectarian strife.",5
2010-08-31,oba,"But ultimately, these terrorists will fail to achieve their goals.",3
2010-08-31,oba,Iraqis are a proud people.,2
2010-08-31,oba,"They have rejected sectarian war, and they have no interest in endless destruction.",5
2010-08-31,oba,"They understand that, in the end, only Iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets.",5
2010-08-31,oba,Only Iraqis can build a democracy within their borders.,3
2010-08-31,oba,"What America can do, and will do, is provide support for the Iraqi people as both a friend and a partner.",5
2010-08-31,oba,Ending this war is not only in Iraq’s interest -- it’s in our own.,5
2010-08-31,oba,The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people.,6
2010-08-31,oba,"We have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home.",6
2010-08-31,oba,"We’ve persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization.",7
2010-08-31,oba,"Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq, we have met our responsibility.",7
2010-08-31,oba,"Now, it’s time to turn the page.",4
2010-08-31,oba,"As we do, I’m mindful that the Iraq war has been a contentious issue at home.",5
2010-08-31,oba,"Here, too, it’s time to turn the page.",4
2010-08-31,oba,"This afternoon, I spoke to former President George W. Bush.",4
2010-08-31,oba,It’s well known that he and I disagreed about the war from its outset.,7
2010-08-31,oba,"Yet no one can doubt President Bush’s support for our troops, or his love of country and commitment to our security.",6
2010-08-31,oba,"As I’ve said, there were patriots who supported this war, and patriots who opposed it.",5
2010-08-31,oba,"And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women, and our hopes for Iraqis’ future.",5
2010-08-31,oba,"The greatness of our democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences, and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead.",7
2010-08-31,oba,And no challenge is more essential to our security than our fight against al Qaeda.,8
2010-08-31,oba,Americans across the political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked us on 9/11.,6
2010-08-31,oba,"Now, as we approach our 10th year of combat in Afghanistan, there are those who are understandably asking tough questions about our mission there.",6
2010-08-31,oba,But we must never lose sight of what’s at stake.,5
2010-08-31,oba,"As we speak, al Qaeda continues to plot against us, and its leadership remains anchored in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",7
2010-08-31,oba,"We will disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda, while preventing Afghanistan from again serving as a base for terrorists.",7
2010-08-31,oba,"And because of our drawdown in Iraq, we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense.",7
2010-08-31,oba,"In fact, over the last 19 months, nearly a dozen al Qaeda leaders -- and hundreds of al Qaeda’s extremist allies -- have been killed or captured around the world.",6
2010-08-31,oba,"Within Afghanistan, I’ve ordered the deployment of additional troops who -- under the command of General David Petraeus -- are fighting to break the Taliban’s momentum.",9
2010-08-31,oba,"As with the surge in Iraq, these forces will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the Afghans to build their capacity and secure their own future.",7
2010-08-31,oba,"But, as was the case in Iraq, we can’t do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves.",4
2010-08-31,oba,That’s why we’re training Afghan Security Forces and supporting a political resolution to Afghanistan’s problems.,7
2010-08-31,oba,"And next August, we will begin a transition to Afghan responsibility.",4
2010-08-31,oba,"The pace of our troop reductions will be determined by conditions on the ground, and our support for Afghanistan will endure.",5
2010-08-31,oba,But make no mistake:  This transition will begin -- because open-ended war serves neither our interests nor the Afghan people’s.,7
2010-08-31,oba,"Indeed, one of the lessons of our effort in Iraq is that American influence around the world is not a function of military force alone.",7
2010-08-31,oba,"We must use all elements of our power -- including our diplomacy, our economic strength, and the power of America’s example -- to secure our interests and stand by our allies.",9
2010-08-31,oba,"And we must project a vision of the future that’s based not just on our fears, but also on our hopes -- a vision that recognizes the real dangers that exist around the world, but also the limitless possibilities of our time.",14
2010-08-31,oba,"Today, old adversaries are at peace, and emerging democracies are potential partners.",3
2010-08-31,oba,New markets for our goods stretch from Asia to the Americas.,4
2010-08-31,oba,A new push for peace in the Middle East will begin here tomorrow.,6
2010-08-31,oba,Billions of young people want to move beyond the shackles of poverty and conflict.,6
2010-08-31,oba,"As the leader of the free world, America will do more than just defeat on the battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction -- we will also lead among those who are willing to work together to expand freedom and opportunity for all people.",10
2010-08-31,oba,"Now, that effort must begin within our own borders.",3
2010-08-31,oba,"Throughout our history, America has been willing to bear the burden of promoting liberty and human dignity overseas, understanding its links to our own liberty and security.",8
2010-08-31,oba,But we have also understood that our nation’s strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home.,4
2010-08-31,oba,And the bedrock of that prosperity must be a growing middle class.,4
2010-08-31,oba,"Unfortunately, over the last decade, we’ve not done what’s necessary to shore up the foundations of our own prosperity.",7

2010-08-31,oba,"We must unleash the innovation that allows new products to roll off our assembly lines, and nurture the ideas that spring from our entrepreneurs.",6
2010-08-31,oba,This will be difficult.,1
2010-08-31,oba,"But in the days to come, it must be our central mission as a people, and my central responsibility as President.",4
2010-08-31,oba,Part of that responsibility is making sure that we honor our commitments to those who have served our country with such valor.,8
2010-08-31,oba,"As long as I am President, we will maintain the finest fighting force that the world has ever known, and we will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as they have served us.",6
2010-08-31,oba,This is a sacred trust.,2
2010-08-31,oba,That’s why we’ve already made one of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades.,8
2010-08-31,oba,We’re treating the signature wounds of today’s wars -- post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury -- while providing the health care and benefits that all of our veterans have earned.,7
2010-08-31,oba,And we’re funding a Post-9/11 GI Bill that helps our veterans and their families pursue the dream of a college education.,7
2010-08-31,oba,"Just as the GI Bill helped those who fought World War II -- including my grandfather -- become the backbone of our middle class, so today’s servicemen and women must have the chance to apply their gifts to expand the American economy.",7

2010-11-02,oba,I told John Boehner and Mitch McConnell that I look forward to working with them.,5
2010-11-02,oba,And I thanked Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid for their extraordinary leadership over the last two years.,5
2010-11-02,oba,After what I'm sure was a long night for a lot of you -- and needless to say it was for me -- I can tell you that some election nights are more fun than others.,6
2010-11-02,oba,Some are exhilarating; some are humbling.,3

2010-11-02,oba,"I did some talking, but mostly I did a lot of listening.",4
2010-11-02,oba,And yesterday’s vote confirmed what I've heard from folks all across America:  People are frustrated -- they’re deeply frustrated -- with the pace of our economic recovery and the opportunities that they hope for their children and their grandchildren.,8
2010-11-02,oba,"They want jobs to come back faster, they want paychecks to go further, and they want the ability to give their children the same chances and opportunities as they’ve had in life.",6
2010-11-02,oba,The men and women who sent us here don't expect Washington to solve all their problems.,3
2010-11-02,oba,"But they do expect Washington to work for them, not against them.",3
2010-11-02,oba,"They want to know that their tax dollars are being spent wisely, not wasted, and that we're not going to leave our children a legacy of debt.",7
2010-11-02,oba,They want to know that their voices aren’t being drowned out by a sea of lobbyists and special interests and partisan bickering.,9
2010-11-02,oba,They want business to be done here openly and honestly.,3
2010-11-02,oba,"Now, I ran for this office to tackle these challenges and give voice to the concerns of everyday people.",7
2010-11-02,oba,"Over the last two years, we’ve made progress.",3
2010-11-02,oba,"But, clearly, too many Americans haven’t felt that progress yet, and they told us that yesterday.",3
2010-11-02,oba,"And as President, I take responsibility for that.",3
2010-11-02,oba,"What yesterday also told us is that no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here, that we must find common ground in order to set -- in order to make progress on some uncommonly difficult challenges.",8
2010-11-02,oba,And I told John Boehner and Mitch McConnell last night I am very eager to sit down with members of both parties and figure out how we can move forward together.,8
2010-11-02,oba,I’m not suggesting this will be easy.,2
2010-11-02,oba,I won’t pretend that we will be able to bridge every difference or solve every disagreement.,6
2010-11-02,oba,"There’s a reason we have two parties in this country, and both Democrats and Republicans have certain beliefs and certain principles that each feels cannot be compromised.",6
2010-11-02,oba,"But what I think the American people are expecting, and what we owe them, is to focus on those issues that affect their jobs, their security, and their future:  reducing our deficit, promoting a clean energy economy, making sure that our children are the best educated in the world, making sure that we’re making the investments in technology that will allow us to keep our competitive edge in the global economy.",8
2010-11-02,oba,Because the most important contest we face is not the contest between Democrats and Republicans.,4
2010-11-02,oba,"In this century, the most important competition we face is between America and our economic competitors around the world.",5
2010-11-02,oba,"To win that competition, and to continue our economic leadership, we’re going to need to be strong and we’re going to need to be united.",4
2010-11-02,oba,None of the challenges we face lend themselves to simple solutions or bumper-sticker slogans.,5
2010-11-02,oba,Nor are the answers found in any one particular philosophy or ideology.,5
2010-11-02,oba,"As I’ve said before, no person, no party, has a monopoly on wisdom.",3
2010-11-02,oba,"And that’s why I’m eager to hear good ideas wherever they come from, whoever proposes them.",5
2010-11-02,oba,And that’s why I believe it’s important to have an honest and civil debate about the choices that we face.,8
2010-11-02,oba,That’s why I want to engage both Democrats and Republicans in serious conversations about where we’re going as a nation.,9
2010-11-02,oba,"And with so much at stake, what the American people don’t want from us, especially here in Washington, is to spend the next two years refighting the political battles of the last two.",6
2010-11-02,oba,We just had a tough election.,2
2010-11-02,oba,We will have another in 2012.,2
2010-11-02,oba,"I’m not so naïve as to think that everybody will put politics aside until then, but I do hope to make progress on the very serious problems facing us right now.",7
2010-11-02,oba,"And that’s going to require all of us, including me, to work harder at building consensus.",5
2010-11-02,oba,"You know, a little over a month ago, we held a town hall meeting in Richmond, Virginia.",5
2010-11-02,oba,And one of the most telling questions came from a small business owner who runs a tree care firm.,6
2010-11-02,oba,He told me how hard he works and how busy he was; how he doesn’t have time to pay attention to all the back-and-forth in Washington.,7
2010-11-02,oba,"And he asked, is there hope for us returning to civility in our discourse, to a healthy legislative process, so as I strap on the boots again tomorrow, I know that you guys got it under control?",8
2010-11-02,oba,"It’s hard to have a faith in that right now, he said.",5
2010-11-02,oba,I do believe there is hope for civility.,4
2010-11-02,oba,I do believe there’s hope for progress.,4
2010-11-02,oba,"And that’s because I believe in the resiliency of a nation that’s bounced back from much worse than what we’re going through right now -- a nation that's overcome war and depression, that has been made more perfect in our struggle for individual rights and individual freedoms.",14
2010-11-02,oba,"Each time progress has come slowly and even painfully, but progress has always come -- because we’ve worked at it and because we’ve believed in it, and most of all, because we remembered that our first allegiance as citizens is not to party or region or faction, but to country -- because while we may be proud Democrats or proud Republicans, we are prouder to be Americans.",8
2010-11-02,oba,And that's something that we all need to remember right now and in the coming months.,5
2010-11-02,oba,"And if we do, I have no doubt that we will continue this nation’s long journey towards a better future.",6
2010-11-02,oba,"So with that, let me take some questions.",3

2011-01-08,oba,"As we discuss these issues, let each of us do so with a good dose of humility.",5
2011-01-08,oba,"Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, let’s use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy and remind ourselves of all the ways that our hopes and dreams are bound together.",9
2011-01-08,oba,"After all, that’s what most of us do when we lose somebody in our family -– especially if the loss is unexpected.",6
2011-01-08,oba,We’re shaken out of our routines.,4
2011-01-08,oba,We’re forced to look inward.,2
2011-01-08,oba,"We reflect on the past:  Did we spend enough time with an aging parent, we wonder.",5
2011-01-08,oba,Did we express our gratitude for all the sacrifices that they made for us?,6
2011-01-08,oba,"Did we tell a spouse just how desperately we loved them, not just once in a while but every single day?",4
2011-01-08,oba,"So sudden loss causes us to look backward -– but it also forces us to look forward; to reflect on the present and the future, on the manner in which we live our lives and nurture our relationships with those who are still with us.",12
2011-01-08,oba,We may ask ourselves if we’ve shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives.,5
2011-01-08,oba,"Perhaps we question whether we're doing right by our children, or our community, whether our priorities are in order.",4
2011-01-08,oba,"We recognize our own mortality, and we are reminded that in the fleeting time we have on this Earth, what matters is not wealth, or status, or power, or fame -– but rather, how well we have loved -- and what small part we have played in making the lives of other people better.",10
2011-01-08,oba,"And that process -- that process of reflection, of making sure we align our values with our actions –- that, I believe, is what a tragedy like this requires.",9

2011-01-26,oba,It’s why we have speed limits and child labor laws.,5
2011-01-26,oba,"It’s why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis.",8
2011-01-26,oba,And it’s why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.,6

2011-01-26,oba,What I’m not willing to do -- what I’m not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition.,8

2011-01-26,oba,We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago.,7

2011-01-26,oba,"I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I’m willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without.",7
2011-01-26,oba,But let’s make sure that we’re not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.,9
2011-01-26,oba,And let’s make sure that what we’re cutting is really excess weight.,5
2011-01-26,oba,Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine.,7

2011-01-26,oba,"Now, most of the cuts and savings I’ve proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget.",6
2011-01-26,oba,"To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough.",8
2011-01-26,oba,It won’t.,1
2011-01-26,oba,The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear.,4
2011-01-26,oba,"I don’t agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress.",3
2011-01-26,oba,"And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it –- in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes.",8
2011-01-26,oba,"This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit.",12
2011-01-26,oba,"The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit.",12
2011-01-26,oba,"Still, I’m willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year -- medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.",9
2011-01-26,oba,"To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations.",5
2011-01-26,oba,"We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americans’ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market.",7
2011-01-26,oba,"And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can’t afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.",7
2011-01-26,oba,"Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break.",5
2011-01-26,oba,It’s not a matter of punishing their success.,5
2011-01-26,oba,It’s about promoting America’s success.,5

2011-01-26,oba,"And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren’t larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this:  If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it.",7
2011-01-26,oba,I will veto it.,1
2011-01-26,oba,The 21st century government that’s open and competent.,3

2011-01-26,oba,"And later, one of his employees said of the rescue, “We proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things.” We do big things.",4
2011-01-26,oba,"From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream.",6
2011-01-26,oba,That’s how we win the future.,3
2011-01-26,oba,"We’re a nation that says, “I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company.”  “I might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.”  “I might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try.”  “I’m not sure how we’ll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we’ll get there.",6

2011-01-31,oba,"Over the past few days, the American people have watched the situation unfolding in Egypt.",4
2011-01-31,oba,We’ve seen enormous demonstrations by the Egyptian people.,4
2011-01-31,oba,"We’ve borne witness to the beginning of a new chapter in the history of a great country, and a long-time partner of the United States.",9
2011-01-31,oba,"And my administration has been in close contact with our Egyptian counterparts and a broad range of the Egyptian people, as well as others across the region and across the globe.",6
2011-01-31,oba,"And throughout this period, we’ve stood for a set of core principles.",5
2011-01-31,oba,"First, we oppose violence.",1
2011-01-31,oba,And I want to commend the Egyptian military for the professionalism and patriotism that it has shown thus far in allowing peaceful protests while protecting the Egyptian people.,7
2011-01-31,oba,"We’ve seen tanks covered with banners, and soldiers and protesters embracing in the streets.",6
2011-01-31,oba,"And going forward, I urge the military to continue its efforts to help ensure that this time of change is peaceful.",8
2011-01-31,oba,"Second, we stand for universal values, including the rights of the Egyptian people to freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and the freedom to access information.",9
2011-01-31,oba,"Once more, we’ve seen the incredible potential for technology to empower citizens and the dignity of those who stand up for a better future.",10
2011-01-31,oba,"And going forward, the United States will continue to stand up for democracy and the universal rights that all human beings deserve, in Egypt and around the world.",6
2011-01-31,oba,"Third, we have spoken out on behalf of the need for change.",6
2011-01-31,oba,"After his speech tonight, I spoke directly to President Mubarak.",3
2011-01-31,oba,He recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and that a change must take place.,4
2011-01-31,oba,"Indeed, all of us who are privileged to serve in positions of political power do so at the will of our people.",9
2011-01-31,oba,"Through thousands of years, Egypt has known many moments of transformation.",4
2011-01-31,oba,The voices of the Egyptian people tell us that this is one of those moments; this is one of those times.,6
2011-01-31,oba,"Now, it is not the role of any other country to determine Egypt’s leaders.",4
2011-01-31,oba,Only the Egyptian people can do that.,2
2011-01-31,oba,"What is clear -- and what I indicated tonight to President Mubarak -- is my belief that an orderly transition must be meaningful, it must be peaceful, and it must begin now.",5
2011-01-31,oba,"Furthermore, the process must include a broad spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties.",5
2011-01-31,oba,It should lead to elections that are free and fair.,5
2011-01-31,oba,"And it should result in a government that’s not only grounded in democratic principles, but is also responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people.",7
2011-01-31,oba,"Throughout this process, the United States will continue to extend the hand of partnership and friendship to Egypt.",5
2011-01-31,oba,And we stand ready to provide any assistance that is necessary to help the Egyptian people as they manage the aftermath of these protests.,10
2011-01-31,oba,"Over the last few days, the passion and the dignity that has been demonstrated by the people of Egypt has been an inspiration to people around the world, including here in the United States, and to all those who believe in the inevitability of human freedom.",10
2011-01-31,oba,"To the people of Egypt, particularly the young people of Egypt, I want to be clear:  We hear your voices.",4
2011-01-31,oba,I have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren.,10
2011-01-31,oba,And I say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the United States and Egypt.,9
2011-01-31,oba,There will be difficult days ahead.,3
2011-01-31,oba,Many questions about Egypt’s future remain unanswered.,5
2011-01-31,oba,But I am confident that the people of Egypt will find those answers.,5
2011-01-31,oba,That truth can be seen in the sense of community in the streets.,5
2011-01-31,oba,It can be seen in the mothers and fathers embracing soldiers.,4
2011-01-31,oba,And it can be seen in the Egyptians who linked arms to protect the national museum -- a new generation protecting the treasures of antiquity; a human chain connecting a great and ancient civilization to the promise of a new day.,10
2011-01-31,oba,Thank you very much.,2
2011-02-19,oba,Thank you.,1
2011-02-19,oba,"Everybody, please have a seat.",2
2011-02-19,oba,Thank you so much.,2
2011-02-19,oba,I am thrilled to be here.,2
2011-02-19,oba,"I want to first of all thank Paul for that introduction, and I want to thank Paul for agreeing to be part of our administration's new Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.",11
2011-02-19,oba,I look forward to our continuing conversations when we meet next week.,3
2011-02-19,oba,"I also want to acknowledge a wonderful Governor, Governor Kitzhaber, who's here.",4
2011-02-19,oba,Thank you so much for all the work that you're doing.,4
2011-02-19,oba,"And the mayor of Hillsboro, Jerry Willey, thank you for the great work that you do.",5
2011-02-19,oba,And I want to thank everybody here at Intel for hosting us here today.,4
2011-02-19,oba,We just had a amazing tour.,2
2011-02-19,oba,"One of my staff, he said, ""It's like magic.""",4
2011-02-19,oba,He did.,1
2011-02-19,oba,That's what he said.,2
2011-02-19,oba,"I had a chance to see everything from an electron microscope to the inside of your microprocessor facility, the clean room.",9
2011-02-19,oba,"And I have to say, for all the gadgets you've got here, what actually most impressed me were the students and the science projects that I just had a chance to see.",6
2011-02-19,oba,It gave them a chance to talk about things like quantum ternary algorithms and it gave me a chance to nod my head and pretend that I understood what they were talking about.,8
2011-02-19,oba,So that was the high school guys.,2
2011-02-19,oba,Then we went over to seriously.,2
2011-02-19,oba,"Then we went over to meet some seventh graders, six girls, and it was wonderful that all girls who had started a science program after school that it involved Legos.",5
2011-02-19,oba,"So I'm thinking, now this is more my speed.",3
2011-02-19,oba,All right?,1
2011-02-19,oba,I used to build some pretty mean Lego towers when I was a kid.,4
2011-02-19,oba,I thought I could participate.,2
2011-02-19,oba,Only these students used their Legos to build models to build robots that were programmable to model brains that could repair broken bones.,9
2011-02-19,oba,So I guess that's different than towers.,4
2011-02-19,oba,It's not as good the towers.,3
2011-02-19,oba,So I couldn't be prouder of these students and all the work that they've done.,6
2011-02-19,oba,"And in my State of the Union Address, I said that it's not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but also the winner of science fairs.",6
2011-02-19,oba,And since the Packers beat my Bears I'm reserving all my celebrating for the winners of the service fairs this year the science fairs.,6
2011-02-19,oba,They deserve applause.,1
2011-02-19,oba,"They deserve our applause and our praise, and they make me optimistic about America's future, just as visiting this facility makes me optimistic about America's future.",7
2011-02-19,oba,"I'm also I'm so proud of everybody here at Intel, not only because of what you do for these students or this community, because but because of what you do for the country.",7
2011-02-19,oba,"A few weeks ago, I went to the Chamber of Commerce, and I talked about the responsibility that American businesses have to create jobs and invest in this country.",9
2011-02-19,oba,And there are few major companies that take this responsibility as seriously as Intel.,5
2011-02-19,oba,"In 1968, Intel started as one of Silicon Valley's first startups.",6
2011-02-19,oba,"And as you grew in leaps and bounds in the eighties and the nineties, you experienced the competitive pressures of globalization, the changes in technology that made it cheaper for many computer companies to start hiring and manufacturing overseas.",8
2011-02-19,oba,"And over the years, you've done some of this yourself.",3
2011-02-19,oba,"And yet, by and large, Intel has placed its bets on America.",2
2011-02-19,oba,"As Paul just mentioned, three-fourths of your manufacturing still happens right here in the United States.",4
2011-02-19,oba,"This year, you'll hire another 4,000 American workers.",3
2011-02-19,oba,You'll create good construction jobs upgrading your facilities and building new plants in Arizona and right here in Oregon.,5
2011-02-19,oba,And this kind of commitment has always been part of Intel's philosophy.,5
2011-02-19,oba,"The founder of this company, the legendary Andy Grove, has said that he's always felt two obligations.",4
2011-02-19,oba,One obligation is to your shareholders.,3
2011-02-19,oba,"But the other obligation is to America, because a lot of what Intel has achieved has been made possible, in Andy's words, ""by a climate of democracy, an economic climate and investment climate provided by our domicile, the United States.""",9
2011-02-19,oba,Intel's possible because of the incredible capacity of America to reinvent itself and to allow people to live out their dreams.,5
2011-02-19,oba,"And so the question we have to ask ourselves now is, how do we maintain this climate that Andy Grove was talking about?",4
2011-02-19,oba,"How do we make sure that more companies like Intel invest here, manufacture here, hire here?",5
2011-02-19,oba,"In a world that is more competitive than ever before, it's our job to make sure that America is the best place on Earth to do business.",6
2011-02-19,oba,"Now, part of that requires knocking down barriers that stand in the way of a company's growth, which is why I've proposed lowering the corporate tax rate and eliminating unnecessary regulations.",13
2011-02-19,oba,"It also requires getting our fiscal house in order, which is why I've proposed a 5-year spending freeze that will reduce the deficit by $400 billion.",10
2011-02-19,oba,That's a freeze that will bring our annual domestic spending to its lowest share of the economy since Eisenhower was President.,7
2011-02-19,oba,"Now, to really get our deficit under control, we're going to have to do more.",3
2011-02-19,oba,"And I want to work with both parties to find additional savings and get rid of excessive spending wherever it exists, whether it's defense spending or health care spending or spending in the Tax Code in the form of loopholes.",6
2011-02-19,oba,"But even as we have to live within our means, we can't sacrifice investments in our future.",5
2011-02-19,oba,"If we want the next technological breakthrough that leads to the next Intel to happen here in the United States not in China or not in Germany, but here in the United States then we have to invest in America's research and technology, in the work of our scientists and our engineers.",8
2011-02-19,oba,"If we want companies like yours to be able to move goods and information quickly and cheaply, we've got to invest in communication and transportation networks, like new roads and bridges, high-speed rail, high-speed Internet.",6
2011-02-19,oba,"If we want to make sure Intel doesn't have to look overseas for skilled, trained workers, then we've got to invest in our people, in our schools, in our colleges, in our children.",8
2011-02-19,oba,"Basically, if we want to win the future, America has to outbuild and outinnovate and outeducate and outhustle the rest of the world.",8
2011-02-19,oba,That's what we've got to do.,3
2011-02-19,oba,"So today I want to focus on one component of that, and that is education.",5
2011-02-19,oba,That's what I want to talk about today.,4
2011-02-19,oba,"Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree.",5
2011-02-19,oba,Times have changed.,1
2011-02-19,oba,"It used to be if you were willing to work hard, you could go to a factory, and you might be able to get a job that lasts 20 years, provide good benefits, provide decent salary.",8
2011-02-19,oba,"These days, those jobs are far and few between.",2
2011-02-19,oba,"Many of the jobs that are going to exist in the future, that exist now like the ones here at Intel require proficiency in math and science.",8
2011-02-19,oba,"And yet today, as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school.",4
2011-02-19,oba,The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations.,5
2011-02-19,oba,"As we just heard Paul say, companies like Intel struggle to hire American workers who have the skills that fit their needs.",7
2011-02-19,oba,So we can't win the future if we lose the race to educate our children.,4
2011-02-19,oba,Can't do it.,1
2011-02-19,oba,"In today's economy, the quality of a nation's education is one of the biggest predictors of a nation's success.",7
2011-02-19,oba,It is what will determine whether the American Dream survives.,4
2011-02-19,oba,"And so it's the responsibility of all of us to get this right: parents, teachers, students, workers, business, and government.",7
2011-02-19,oba,We're all going to have to focus on this like a laser.,5
2011-02-19,oba,"And over the past 2 years, my administration's guiding philosophy has been that when it comes to reforming our schools, Washington shouldn't try to dictate all the answers.",6
2011-02-19,oba,What we should be doing is rewarding and replicating the success of schools that have figured out a way to raise their standards and improve student performance.,11
2011-02-19,oba,And so here's what we did.,2
2011-02-19,oba,"Instead of pouring Federal money into a system that wasn't working, we launched a competition.",6
2011-02-19,oba,We called it Race to the Top.,3
2011-02-19,oba,"To all 50 States we said, if you show us reforms that will lead to real results, we'll show you the money.",7
2011-02-19,oba,Race to the Top has turned out to be the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation.,5
2011-02-19,oba,"For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 States 40 to raise their standards for teaching and for learning.",6
2011-02-19,oba,"And these standards weren't developed in Washington, they were developed by Republican and Democratic Governors throughout the country.",4
2011-02-19,oba,"Because we know that, other than parents, perhaps the biggest impact on a child's success comes from the man or woman who's sitting or who is standing in front of the classroom, we've also focused a lot on teaching, on teachers.",11
2011-02-19,oba,We want to make teaching an honored profession in our society.,6
2011-02-19,oba,We want to reward good teachers.,3
2011-02-19,oba,We want to stop making excuses for bad teachers.,6
2011-02-19,oba,"And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, fields that will give the students the skills they need for the jobs that exist in places like Intel.",13
2011-02-19,oba,"To ensure that higher education is within the reach of every American, we've extended we put an end to unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that used to go to banks, and we put the savings towards making college more affordable for millions of students.",8
2011-02-19,oba,"And this year, we want to make permanent our tuition tax credit, which is worth $10,000 for 4 years of college.",9
2011-02-19,oba,"And finally, to make sure anyone can get trained and prepared for whatever career they pursue, we want to revitalize America's community colleges.",8
2011-02-19,oba,Not everybody needs to go to a 4-year college.,5
2011-02-19,oba,And so we've launched a nationwide initiative to connect graduates that need a job with businesses that need their skills.,10
2011-02-19,oba,And we've drawn lessons from Intel's experience.,4
2011-02-19,oba,"For years, Intel has recognized the value of these kinds of partnerships between schools and businesses.",8
2011-02-19,oba,This company understands that your success depends on a pipeline of skilled workers who are ready to fill high-tech jobs.,11
2011-02-19,oba,"And so over the last decade, you've invested $50 million to support education in the State of Oregon.",6
2011-02-19,oba,You've started programs [Applause].,1
2011-02-19,oba,That's worth applause.,2
2011-02-19,oba,"You've started programs that get kids interested in engineering and technology as early as elementary school, like those six girls that I met.",7
2011-02-19,oba,You've sponsored mentoring and engineering competitions for poor and underserved high school students.,5
2011-02-19,oba,Your employer your employees volunteer some of you probably here have volunteered as tutors in nearby schools and universities.,4
2011-02-19,oba,"You've helped train 7,000 Oregon teachers over the last 10 years.",4
2011-02-19,oba,"Your science fairs, your talent searches are some of the largest and most prestigious in the world, producing multiple Nobel Prize winners.",6
2011-02-19,oba,And I expect some of the students I met will qualify soon.,6
2011-02-19,oba,"And we were so grateful that Intel was one of the four companies that initially joined our administration's nationwide campaign to boost math and science education here in America, as part of a new organization called Change the Equation.",11
2011-02-19,oba,So you guys have been pretty busy here at Intel.,2
2011-02-19,oba,"You've given countless students the chance to succeed, and for that you should be very proud.",3
2011-02-19,oba,But you're not just a good corporate role model.,2
2011-02-19,oba,You're a corporation who understands that investing in education is also a good business model.,6
2011-02-19,oba,It's good for the bottom line.,3
2011-02-19,oba,"A lot of your employees were engineering undergraduates at Oregon State or Portland State, right?",6
2011-02-19,oba,"How many Beavers here, by the way?",3
2011-02-19,oba,You know my brother-in-law's the coach there.,3
2011-02-19,oba,Just wanted to point that out.,2
2011-02-19,oba,"They're a young team, but they're on the move.",4
2011-02-19,oba,"But here's what we know: If you can spark a student's interest in math or science, who would have otherwise dropped out, you might not just change a child's life, you may nurture the talent that one day discovers the breakthrough that changes this industry forever.",2
2011-02-19,oba,"In fact, before I came here, I read a story about a young University of Oregon graduate.",6
2011-02-19,oba,"His name is Nabil Mistkawi, and he joined Intel as an engineer in 1993.",5
2011-02-19,oba,"After working with so many other employees who had doctorate degrees, Nabil decided to go back to school and get his Ph.D. in chemistry at Portland State University.",7
2011-02-19,oba,"And thanks to Intel, he was able to pay for his degree and keep his full-time job.",6
2011-02-19,oba,"Now, during that time, Intel was trying to find a faster, more efficient way to process their microchips, but nobody could figure it out.",5
2011-02-19,oba,And they asked at least eight other companies and research labs for help.,4
2011-02-19,oba,Some said it couldn't be done.,2
2011-02-19,oba,Others worked on it for nearly a year with no success.,4
2011-02-19,oba,And so they asked Nabil if he wanted to give it a shot.,4
2011-02-19,oba,Within 3 days 3 days he came up with a solution that is now saving this company millions of dollars a year.,6
2011-02-19,oba,And I will not embarrass myself by trying to explain what his answer was and most of you probably know how it works anyway.,6
2011-02-19,oba,"The point is, an investment in education paid off in a big way: for Nabil, for Intel, for the millions of workers and consumers who benefited from that discovery.",7
2011-02-19,oba,"So for all the daunting statistics about our educational failings as a nation, for all the naysayers predicting America's decline you've been hearing them lately stories like this give me hope.",7
2011-02-19,oba,Stories like these give me confidence that America will win the future.,4
2011-02-19,oba,We know what works.,2
2011-02-19,oba,We know how to succeed.,2
2011-02-19,oba,We know how to do big things.,3
2011-02-19,oba,"And all across this Nation, in places just like this one, we have students and teachers, local leaders and companies, who are working together to make it happen.",5
2011-02-19,oba,"When it comes to competing with other nations for the jobs and industries of the future, we are all on the same team: the American team.",10
2011-02-19,oba,"And if we start rowing in the same direction, I promise you, there is nothing that we cannot achieve.",5
2011-02-19,oba,That's what you're proving here at Intel.,3
2011-02-19,oba,That's what you're proving in the schools and colleges of this State.,6
2011-02-19,oba,That's what America will prove in the months and years ahead.,4
2011-02-19,oba,"Thank you, guys.",1
2011-02-19,oba,God bless you.,1
2011-05-02,oba,Good evening.,1
2011-05-02,oba,"Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who’s responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.",15
2011-05-02,oba,It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history.,6
2011-05-02,oba,"The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory -- hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky; the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground; black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon; the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction.",10
2011-05-02,oba,And yet we know that the worst images are those that were unseen to the world.,7
2011-05-02,oba,The empty seat at the dinner table.,3
2011-05-02,oba,Children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father.,6
2011-05-02,oba,Parents who would never know the feeling of their child’s embrace.,6
2011-05-02,oba,"Nearly 3,000 citizens taken from us, leaving a gaping hole in our hearts.",6
2011-05-02,oba,"On September 11, 2001, in our time of grief, the American people came together.",4
2011-05-02,oba,"We offered our neighbors a hand, and we offered the wounded our blood.",3
2011-05-02,oba,"We reaffirmed our ties to each other, and our love of community and country.",4
2011-05-02,oba,"On that day, no matter where we came from, what God we prayed to, or what race or ethnicity we were, we were united as one American family.",4
2011-05-02,oba,We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice.,8
2011-05-02,oba,"We quickly learned that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by al Qaeda -- an organization headed by Osama bin Laden, which had openly declared war on the United States and was committed to killing innocents in our country and around the globe.",14
2011-05-02,oba,"And so we went to war against al Qaeda to protect our citizens, our friends, and our allies.",5
2011-05-02,oba,"Over the last 10 years, thanks to the tireless and heroic work of our military and our counterterrorism professionals, we’ve made great strides in that effort.",7
2011-05-02,oba,We’ve disrupted terrorist attacks and strengthened our homeland defense.,3
2011-05-02,oba,"In Afghanistan, we removed the Taliban government, which had given bin Laden and al Qaeda safe haven and support.",5
2011-05-02,oba,"And around the globe, we worked with our friends and allies to capture or kill scores of al Qaeda terrorists, including several who were a part of the 9/11 plot.",10
2011-05-02,oba,Yet Osama bin Laden avoided capture and escaped across the Afghan border into Pakistan.,4
2011-05-02,oba,"Meanwhile, al Qaeda continued to operate from along that border and operate through its affiliates across the world.",7
2011-05-02,oba,"And so shortly after taking office, I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al Qaeda, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network.",8
2011-05-02,oba,"Then, last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden.",7
2011-05-02,oba,"It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground.",4
2011-05-02,oba,I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside of Pakistan.,11
2011-05-02,oba,"And finally, last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.",6
2011-05-02,oba,"Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.",4
2011-05-02,oba,A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability.,3
2011-05-02,oba,No Americans were harmed.,2
2011-05-02,oba,They took care to avoid civilian casualties.,3
2011-05-02,oba,"After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.",5
2011-05-02,oba,"For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda’s leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies.",7
2011-05-02,oba,The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat al Qaeda.,6
2011-05-02,oba,Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort.,4
2011-05-02,oba,There’s no doubt that al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us.,6
2011-05-02,oba,We must –- and we will -- remain vigilant at home and abroad.,4
2011-05-02,oba,"As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not –- and never will be -– at war with Islam.",6
2011-05-02,oba,"I’ve made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam.",3
2011-05-02,oba,Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims.,3
2011-05-02,oba,"Indeed, al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own.",5
2011-05-02,oba,So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.,7
2011-05-02,oba,"Over the years, I’ve repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was.",5
2011-05-02,oba,That is what we’ve done.,2
2011-05-02,oba,But it’s important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding.,8
2011-05-02,oba,"Indeed, bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well, and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people.",5
2011-05-02,oba,"Tonight, I called President Zardari, and my team has also spoken with their Pakistani counterparts.",4
2011-05-02,oba,They agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations.,7
2011-05-02,oba,"And going forward, it is essential that Pakistan continue to join us in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates.",8
2011-05-02,oba,The American people did not choose this fight.,2
2011-05-02,oba,"It came to our shores, and started with the senseless slaughter of our citizens.",6
2011-05-02,oba,"After nearly 10 years of service, struggle, and sacrifice, we know well the costs of war.",6
2011-05-02,oba,"These efforts weigh on me every time I, as Commander-in-Chief, have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one, or look into the eyes of a service member who’s been gravely wounded.",13
2011-05-02,oba,So Americans understand the costs of war.,3
2011-05-02,oba,"Yet as a country, we will never tolerate our security being threatened, nor stand idly by when our people have been killed.",4
2011-05-02,oba,We will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies.,7
2011-05-02,oba,We will be true to the values that make us who we are.,7
2011-05-02,oba,"And on nights like this one, we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to al Qaeda’s terror: Justice has been done.",7
2011-05-02,oba,"Tonight, we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who’ve worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome.",6
2011-05-02,oba,"The American people do not see their work, nor know their names.",3
2011-05-02,oba,"But tonight, they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice.",6
2011-05-02,oba,"We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism, and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country.",9
2011-05-02,oba,And they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of the burden since that September day.,8
2011-05-02,oba,"Finally, let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 that we have never forgotten your loss, nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores.",12
2011-05-02,oba,"And tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11.",7
2011-05-02,oba,"I know that it has, at times, frayed.",3
2011-05-02,oba,Yet today’s achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people.,7
2011-05-02,oba,The cause of securing our country is not complete.,5
2011-05-02,oba,"But tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to.",4
2011-05-02,oba,"That is the story of our history, whether it’s the pursuit of prosperity for our people, or the struggle for equality for all our citizens; our commitment to stand up for our values abroad, and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place.",7
2011-05-02,oba,"Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power, but because of who we are: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.",6
2011-05-02,oba,Thank you.,1
2011-05-02,oba,May God bless you.,1
2011-05-02,oba,And may God bless the United States of America.,3
2011-05-23,oba,Thank you.,1
2011-05-23,oba,Thank you.,1
2011-05-23,oba,Thank you!,1
2011-05-23,oba,Thank you so much.,2
2011-05-23,oba,"Please, please be seated.",1
2011-05-23,oba,"Thank you, Governor, for that powerful message, but more importantly, for being here with and for your people every step of the way.",6
2011-05-23,oba,"We are grateful to you, to Reverend Gariss, Father Monaghan.",4
2011-05-23,oba,I’m so glad you got in that tub.,5
2011-05-23,oba,To Reverend Brown for that incredibly powerful message.,5
2011-05-23,oba,"To Senator Claire McCaskill, who’s been here, and Congressman Billy Long; Mayor Woolston.",3
2011-05-23,oba,To Craig Fugate.,2
2011-05-23,oba,"It doesn’t get a lot of attention, but he heads up FEMA, our emergency response at the federal level.",6
2011-05-23,oba,He’s been going from Tuscaloosa to Joplin and everywhere in between tirelessly doing outstanding work.,7
2011-05-23,oba,We’re grateful for him.,3
2011-05-23,oba,"Gail McGovern, the President of the National Red Cross, which has contributed mightily to the rebuilding efforts here.",4
2011-05-23,oba,"Most of all, to the family and friends of all those who’ve been lost and all those who’ve been affected.",7
2011-05-23,oba,"Today we gather to celebrate the lives of those we’ve lost to the storms here in Joplin and across the Midwest, to keep in our prayers those still missing, to mourn with their families, to stand together during this time of pain and trial.",11
2011-05-23,oba,"And as Reverend Brown alluded to, the question that weighs on us at a time like this is: Why?",6
2011-05-23,oba,Why our town?,1
2011-05-23,oba,Why our home?,1
2011-05-23,oba,"Why my son, or husband, or wife, or sister, or friend?",4
2011-05-23,oba,Why?,1
2011-05-23,oba,We do not have the capacity to answer.,3
2011-05-23,oba,"We can’t know when a terrible storm will strike, or where, or the severity of the devastation that it may cause.",7
2011-05-23,oba,"We can’t know why we’re tested with the loss of a loved one, or the loss of a home where we’ve lived a lifetime.",9
2011-05-23,oba,These things are beyond our power to control.,4
2011-05-23,oba,But that does not mean we are powerless in the face of adversity.,6
2011-05-23,oba,How we respond when the storm strikes is up to us.,4
2011-05-23,oba,"How we live in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache, that’s within our control.",6
2011-05-23,oba,"And it’s in these moments, through our actions, that we often see the glimpse of what makes life worth living in the first place.",9
2011-05-23,oba,"In the last week, that’s what Joplin has not just taught Missouri, not just taught America, but has taught the world.",4
2011-05-23,oba,"I was overseas in the aftermath of the storm, and had world leaders coming up to me saying, let the people of Joplin know we are with them; we’re thinking about them; we love them.",7
2011-05-23,oba,Because the world saw how Joplin responded.,2
2011-05-23,oba,A university turned itself into a makeshift hospital.,3
2011-05-23,oba,"Some of you used your pickup trucks as ambulances, carrying the injured -- on doors that served as stretchers.",6
2011-05-23,oba,Your restaurants have rushed food to people in need.,2
2011-05-23,oba,Businesses have filled trucks with donations.,2
2011-05-23,oba,"You’ve waited in line for hours to donate blood to people you know, but also to people you’ve never met.",4
2011-05-23,oba,"And in all this, you have lived the words of Scripture:

    We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;
    we are perplexed, but not in despair;
    Persecuted, but not forsaken;
    cast down, but not destroyed....

As the governor said, you have shown the world what it means to love thy neighbor.",6
2011-05-23,oba,You’ve banded together.,1
2011-05-23,oba,You’ve come to each other’s aid.,4
2011-05-23,oba,"You’ve demonstrated a simple truth: that amid heartbreak and tragedy, no one is a stranger.",4
2011-05-23,oba,Everybody is a brother.,2
2011-05-23,oba,Everybody is a sister.,2
2011-05-23,oba,We can all love one another.,2
2011-05-23,oba,"As you move forward in the days ahead, I know that rebuilding what you’ve lost won’t be easy.",4
2011-05-23,oba,"I just walked through some of the neighborhoods that have been affected, and you look out at the landscape, and there have to be moments where you just say, where to begin?",6
2011-05-23,oba,How to start?,1
2011-05-23,oba,"There are going to be moments where after the shock has worn off, you feel alone.",6
2011-05-23,oba,But there’s no doubt in my mind what the people of this community can do.,5
2011-05-23,oba,There’s no doubt in my mind that Joplin will rebuild.,3
2011-05-23,oba,"And as President, I can promise you your country will be there with you every single step of the way.",5
2011-05-23,oba,We will be with you every step of the way.,4
2011-05-23,oba,We’re not going anywhere.,1
2011-05-23,oba,The cameras may leave.,2
2011-05-23,oba,The spotlight may shift.,2
2011-05-23,oba,But we will be with you every step of the way until Joplin is restored and this community is back on its feet.,6
2011-05-23,oba,We’re not going anywhere.,1
2011-05-23,oba,That is not just my promise; that’s America’s promise.,3
2011-05-23,oba,"It’s a promise I make here in Joplin; it’s a promise I made down in Tuscaloosa, or in any of the communities that have been hit by these devastating storms over the last few weeks.",8
2011-05-23,oba,"Now, there have been countless acts of kindness and selflessness in recent days.",4
2011-05-23,oba,We’ve already heard the record of some of that.,5
2011-05-23,oba,"But perhaps none are as inspiring as what took place when the storm was bearing down on Joplin, threatening an entire community with utter destruction.",7
2011-05-23,oba,"And in the face of winds that showed no mercy, no regard for human life, that did not discriminate by race or faith or background, it was ordinary people, swiftly tested, who said, “I’m willing to die right now so that someone else might live.”

It was the husband who threw himself over his wife as their house came apart around them.",8
2011-05-23,oba,It was the mother who shielded her young son.,4
2011-05-23,oba,"It was Dean Wells, a husband and father who loved to sing and whistle in his church choir.",8
2011-05-23,oba,"Dean was working a shift at the Home Depot, managing the electrical department, when the siren rang out.",5
2011-05-23,oba,"He sprang into action, moving people to safety.",3
2011-05-23,oba,"Over and over again, he went back for others, until a wall came down on top of him.",5
2011-05-23,oba,"In the end, most of the building was destroyed, but not where Dean had directed his coworkers and his customers.",4
2011-05-23,oba,There was a young man named Christopher Lucas who was 26 years old.,5
2011-05-23,oba,Father of two daughters; third daughter on the way.,4
2011-05-23,oba,"Just like any other night, Christopher was doing his job as manager on duty at Pizza Hut.",3
2011-05-23,oba,And then he heard the storm coming.,3
2011-05-23,oba,It was then when this former sailor quickly ushered everybody into the walk-in freezer.,5
2011-05-23,oba,"The only problem was, the freezer door wouldn’t stay closed from the inside.",5
2011-05-23,oba,"So as the tornado bore down on this small storefront on Range Line Road, Christopher left the freezer to find a rope or a cord or anything to hold the door shut.",8
2011-05-23,oba,"He made it back just in time, tying a piece of bungee cord to the handle outside, wrapping the other end around his arm, holding the door closed with all his might.",6
2011-05-23,oba,"And Christopher held it as long as he could, until he was pulled away by the incredible force of the storm.",6
2011-05-23,oba,He died saving more than a dozen people in that freezer.,5
2011-05-23,oba,"You see, there are heroes all around us, all the time.",3
2011-05-23,oba,"They walk by us on the sidewalk, and they sit next to us in class.",4
2011-05-23,oba,They pass us in the aisle wearing an orange apron.,3
2011-05-23,oba,They come to our table at a restaurant and ask us what we’d like to order.,4
2011-05-23,oba,"Just as we can’t know why tragedy strikes in the first place, we may never fully understand where these men and women find the courage and strength to do what they did.",5
2011-05-23,oba,"What we do know is that in a split-second moment where there’s little time for internal reflection or debate, the actions of these individuals were driven by love -- love for a family member, love for a friend, or just love for a fellow human being.",8
2011-05-23,oba,That’s good to know.,3
2011-05-23,oba,"In a world that can be cruel and selfish, it’s this knowledge -- the knowledge that we are inclined to love one another, that we’re inclined to do good, to be good -- that causes us to take heart.",7
2011-05-23,oba,We see with fresh eyes what’s precious and so fragile and so important to us.,6
2011-05-23,oba,We put aside our petty grievances and our minor disagreements.,3
2011-05-23,oba,We see ourselves in the hopes and hardships of others.,5
2011-05-23,oba,"And in the stories of people like Dean and people like Christopher, we remember that each us contains reserves of resolve and compassion.",8
2011-05-23,oba,"There are heroes all around us, all the time.",3
2011-05-23,oba,"And so, in the wake of this tragedy, let us live up to their example -- to make each day count -- to live with the sense of mutual regard -- to live with that same compassion that they demonstrated in their final hours.",10
2011-05-23,oba,We are called by them to do everything we can to be worthy of the chance that we’ve been given to carry on.,9
2011-05-23,oba,"I understand that at a memorial yesterday for Dean, his wife decided to play a recording of Dean whistling a song he loved -- Amazing Grace.",5

    I have already come;
    'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far

    I shall possess within the veil,
    A life of joy and peace.",5

2011-06-23,oba,"A second war was launched in Iraq, and we spent enormous blood and treasure to support a new government there.",4
2011-06-23,oba,"By the time I took office, the war in Afghanistan had entered its seventh year.",4

2011-06-23,oba,"Without a new strategy and decisive action, our military commanders warned that we could face a resurgent al Qaeda and a Taliban taking over large parts of Afghanistan.",7
2011-06-23,oba,"For this reason, in one of the most difficult decisions that I’ve made as President, I ordered an additional 30,000 American troops into Afghanistan.",7
2011-06-23,oba,"When I announced this surge at West Point, we set clear objectives: to refocus on al Qaeda, to reverse the Taliban’s momentum, and train Afghan security forces to defend their own country.",6
2011-06-23,oba,"I also made it clear that our commitment would not be open-ended, and that we would begin to draw down our forces this July.",4

2011-06-23,oba,"After this initial reduction, our troops will continue coming home at a steady pace as Afghan security forces move into the lead.",5
2011-06-23,oba,Our mission will change from combat to support.,2
2011-06-23,oba,"By 2014, this process of transition will be complete, and the Afghan people will be responsible for their own security.",5

The information that we recovered from bin Laden’s compound shows al Qaeda under enormous strain.",4
2011-06-23,oba,"Bin Laden expressed concern that al Qaeda had been unable to effectively replace senior terrorists that had been killed, and that al Qaeda has failed in its effort to portray America as a nation at war with Islam -– thereby draining more widespread support.",10
2011-06-23,oba,"Al Qaeda remains dangerous, and we must be vigilant against attacks.",4
2011-06-23,oba,"But we have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat, and we will not relent until the job is done.",4

2011-06-23,oba,"Of course, huge challenges remain.",2
2011-06-23,oba,This is the beginning -- but not the end –- of our effort to wind down this war.,7

2011-06-23,oba,"And next May, in Chicago, we will host a summit with our NATO allies and partners to shape the next phase of this transition.",5
2011-06-23,oba,We do know that peace cannot come to a land that has known so much war without a political settlement.,7
2011-06-23,oba,"So as we strengthen the Afghan government and security forces, America will join initiatives that reconcile the Afghan people, including the Taliban.",6
2011-06-23,oba,"Our position on these talks is clear: They must be led by the Afghan government, and those who want to be a part of a peaceful Afghanistan must break from al Qaeda, abandon violence, and abide by the Afghan constitution.",8
2011-06-23,oba,"But, in part because of our military effort, we have reason to believe that progress can be made.",4

2011-06-23,oba,We won't try to make Afghanistan a perfect place.,3
2011-06-23,oba,We will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely.,3

2011-06-23,oba,"Others would have America over-extended, confronting every evil that can be found abroad.",4
2011-06-23,oba,We must chart a more centered course.,3
2011-06-23,oba,"Like generations before, we must embrace America’s singular role in the course of human events.",5

2011-06-23,oba,"This officer -- like so many others I’ve met on bases, in Baghdad and Bagram, and at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital - spoke with humility about how his unit worked together as one, depending on each other, and trusting one another, as a family might do in a time of peril.",12

2011-07-26,oba,"Tonight, I want to talk about the debate we’ve been having in Washington over the national debt -- a debate that directly affects the lives of all Americans.",9
2011-07-26,oba,"For the last decade, we’ve spent more money than we take in.",3
2011-07-26,oba,"In the year 2000, the government had a budget surplus.",3
2011-07-26,oba,"But instead of using it to pay off our debt, the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our nation’s credit card.",5
2011-07-26,oba,"As a result, the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.",5
2011-07-26,oba,"To make matters worse, the recession meant that there was less money coming in, and it required us to spend even more -– on tax cuts for middle-class families to spur the economy; on unemployment insurance; on aid to states so we could prevent more teachers and firefighters and police officers from being laid off.",7
2011-07-26,oba,These emergency steps also added to the deficit.,3
2011-07-26,oba,"Now, every family knows that a little credit card debt is manageable.",4
2011-07-26,oba,"But if we stay on the current path, our growing debt could cost us jobs and do serious damage to the economy.",5
2011-07-26,oba,More of our tax dollars will go toward paying off the interest on our loans.,6
2011-07-26,oba,Businesses will be less likely to open up shop and hire workers in a country that can’t balance its books.,9
2011-07-26,oba,"Interest rates could climb for everyone who borrows money -– the homeowner with a mortgage, the student with a college loan, the corner store that wants to expand.",7
2011-07-26,oba,"And we won’t have enough money to make job-creating investments in things like education and infrastructure, or pay for vital programs like Medicare and Medicaid.",8
2011-07-26,oba,"Because neither party is blameless for the decisions that led to this problem, both parties have a responsibility to solve it.",8
2011-07-26,oba,"And over the last several months, that’s what we’ve been trying to do.",3
2011-07-26,oba,"I won’t bore you with the details of every plan or proposal, but basically, the debate has centered around two different approaches.",5
2011-07-26,oba,"The first approach says, let’s live within our means by making serious, historic cuts in government spending.",8
2011-07-26,oba,Let’s cut domestic spending to the lowest level it’s been since Dwight Eisenhower was President.,7
2011-07-26,oba,Let’s cut defense spending at the Pentagon by hundreds of billions of dollars.,7
2011-07-26,oba,"Let’s cut out waste and fraud in health care programs like Medicare -- and at the same time, let’s make modest adjustments so that Medicare is still there for future generations.",6
2011-07-26,oba,"Finally, let’s ask the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to give up some of their breaks in the tax code and special deductions.",9
2011-07-26,oba,This balanced approach asks everyone to give a little without requiring anyone to sacrifice too much.,6
2011-07-26,oba,It would reduce the deficit by around $4 trillion and put us on a path to pay down our debt.,6
2011-07-26,oba,"And the cuts wouldn’t happen so abruptly that they’d be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from helping small businesses and middle-class families get back on their feet right now.",9
2011-07-26,oba,This approach is also bipartisan.,2
2011-07-26,oba,"While many in my own party aren’t happy with the painful cuts it makes, enough will be willing to accept them if the burden is fairly shared.",6
2011-07-26,oba,"While Republicans might like to see deeper cuts and no revenue at all, there are many in the Senate who have said, “Yes, I’m willing to put politics aside and consider this approach because I care about solving the problem.”  And to his credit, this is the kind of approach the Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, was working on with me over the last several weeks.",11
2011-07-26,oba,The only reason this balanced approach isn’t on its way to becoming law right now is because a significant number of Republicans in Congress are insisting on a different approach -- a cuts-only approach -– an approach that doesn’t ask the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to contribute anything at all.,9
2011-07-26,oba,"And because nothing is asked of those at the top of the income scale, such an approach would close the deficit only with more severe cuts to programs we all care about –- cuts that place a greater burden on working families.",12
2011-07-26,oba,So the debate right now isn’t about whether we need to make tough choices.,5
2011-07-26,oba,Democrats and Republicans agree on the amount of deficit reduction we need.,6
2011-07-26,oba,The debate is about how it should be done.,3
2011-07-26,oba,"Most Americans, regardless of political party, don’t understand how we can ask a senior citizen to pay more for her Medicare before we ask a corporate jet owner or the oil companies to give up tax breaks that other companies don’t get.",7
2011-07-26,oba,How can we ask a student to pay more for college before we ask hedge fund managers to stop paying taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries?,9
2011-07-26,oba,How can we slash funding for education and clean energy before we ask people like me to give up tax breaks we don’t need and didn’t ask for?,6
2011-07-26,oba,That’s not right.,1
2011-07-26,oba,It’s not fair.,1
2011-07-26,oba,"We all want a government that lives within its means, but there are still things we need to pay for as a country -– things like new roads and bridges; weather satellites and food inspection; services to veterans and medical research.",8
2011-07-26,oba,"And keep in mind that under a balanced approach, the 98 percent of Americans who make under $250,000 would see no tax increases at all.",7
2011-07-26,oba,None.,1
2011-07-26,oba,"In fact, I want to extend the payroll tax cut for working families.",5
2011-07-26,oba,What we’re talking about under a balanced approach is asking Americans whose incomes have gone up the most over the last decade -– millionaires and billionaires -– to share in the sacrifice everyone else has to make.,6
2011-07-26,oba,And I think these patriotic Americans are willing to pitch in.,4
2011-07-26,oba,"In fact, over the last few decades, they’ve pitched in every time we passed a bipartisan deal to reduce the deficit.",6
2011-07-26,oba,"The first time a deal was passed, a predecessor of mine made the case for a balanced approach by saying this:

“Would you rather reduce deficits and interest rates by raising revenue from those who are not now paying their fair share, or would you rather accept larger budget deficits, higher interest rates, and higher unemployment?",11
2011-07-26,oba,"And I think I know your answer.”

Those words were spoken by Ronald Reagan.",3
2011-07-26,oba,"But today, many Republicans in the House refuse to consider this kind of balanced approach -– an approach that was pursued not only by President Reagan, but by the first President Bush, by President Clinton, by myself, and by many Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate.",11
2011-07-26,oba,So we’re left with a stalemate.,3
2011-07-26,oba,"Now, what makes today’s stalemate so dangerous is that it has been tied to something known as the debt ceiling -– a term that most people outside of Washington have probably never heard of before.",7
2011-07-26,oba,Understand –- raising the debt ceiling does not allow Congress to spend more money.,4
2011-07-26,oba,It simply gives our country the ability to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up.,5
2011-07-26,oba,"In the past, raising the debt ceiling was routine.",3
2011-07-26,oba,"Since the 1950s, Congress has always passed it, and every President has signed it.",3
2011-07-26,oba,President Reagan did it 18 times.,2
2011-07-26,oba,George W. Bush did it seven times.,2
2011-07-26,oba,"And we have to do it by next Tuesday, August 2nd, or else we won’t be able to pay all of our bills.",7
2011-07-26,oba,"Unfortunately, for the past several weeks, Republican House members have essentially said that the only way they’ll vote to prevent America’s first-ever default is if the rest of us agree to their deep, spending cuts-only approach.",7
2011-07-26,oba,"If that happens, and we default, we would not have enough money to pay all of our bills -– bills that include monthly Social Security checks, veterans’ benefits, and the government contracts we’ve signed with thousands of businesses.",9
2011-07-26,oba,"For the first time in history, our country’s AAA credit rating would be downgraded, leaving investors around the world to wonder whether the United States is still a good bet.",5
2011-07-26,oba,"Interest rates would skyrocket on credit cards, on mortgages and on car loans, which amounts to a huge tax hike on the American people.",9
2011-07-26,oba,We would risk sparking a deep economic crisis -– this one caused almost entirely by Washington.,4
2011-07-26,oba,So defaulting on our obligations is a reckless and irresponsible outcome to this debate.,4
2011-07-26,oba,And Republican leaders say that they agree we must avoid default.,3
2011-07-26,oba,"But the new approach that Speaker Boehner unveiled today, which would temporarily extend the debt ceiling in exchange for spending cuts, would force us to once again face the threat of default just six months from now.",7
2011-07-26,oba,"In other words, it doesn’t solve the problem.",3
2011-07-26,oba,"First of all, a six-month extension of the debt ceiling might not be enough to avoid a credit downgrade and the higher interest rates that all Americans would have to pay as a result.",9
2011-07-26,oba,We know what we have to do to reduce our deficits; there’s no point in putting the economy at risk by kicking the can further down the road.,8
2011-07-26,oba,But there’s an even greater danger to this approach.,4
2011-07-26,oba,"Based on what we’ve seen these past few weeks, we know what to expect six months from now.",5
2011-07-26,oba,The House of Representatives will once again refuse to prevent default unless the rest of us accept their cuts-only approach.,5
2011-07-26,oba,"Again, they will refuse to ask the wealthiest Americans to give up their tax cuts or deductions.",4
2011-07-26,oba,"Again, they will demand harsh cuts to programs like Medicare.",5
2011-07-26,oba,"And once again, the economy will be held captive unless they get their way.",3
2011-07-26,oba,This is no way to run the greatest country on Earth.,5
2011-07-26,oba,"It’s a dangerous game that we’ve never played before, and we can’t afford to play it now.",3
2011-07-26,oba,Not when the jobs and livelihoods of so many families are at stake.,5
2011-07-26,oba,We can’t allow the American people to become collateral damage to Washington’s political warfare.,6
2011-07-26,oba,"Congress now has one week left to act, and there are still paths forward.",4
2011-07-26,oba,"The Senate has introduced a plan to avoid default, which makes a down payment on deficit reduction and ensures that we don’t have to go through this again in six months.",10
2011-07-26,oba,"I think that’s a much better approach, although serious deficit reduction would still require us to tackle the tough challenges of entitlement and tax reform.",8
2011-07-26,oba,"Either way, I’ve told leaders of both parties that they must come up with a fair compromise in the next few days that can pass both houses of Congress -– and a compromise that I can sign.",9
2011-07-26,oba,I’m confident we can reach this compromise.,4
2011-07-26,oba,"Despite our disagreements, Republican leaders and I have found common ground before.",3
2011-07-26,oba,And I believe that enough members of both parties will ultimately put politics aside and help us make progress.,5
2011-07-26,oba,"Now, I realize that a lot of the new members of Congress and I don’t see eye-to-eye on many issues.",6
2011-07-26,oba,But we were each elected by some of the same Americans for some of the same reasons.,5
2011-07-26,oba,"Yes, many want government to start living within its means.",5
2011-07-26,oba,And many are fed up with a system in which the deck seems stacked against middle-class Americans in favor of the wealthiest few.,8
2011-07-26,oba,But do you know what people are fed up with most of all?,5
2011-07-26,oba,They’re fed up with a town where compromise has become a dirty word.,5
2011-07-26,oba,"They work all day long, many of them scraping by, just to put food on the table.",5
2011-07-26,oba,"And when these Americans come home at night, bone-tired, and turn on the news, all they see is the same partisan three-ring circus here in Washington.",5
2011-07-26,oba,They see leaders who can’t seem to come together and do what it takes to make life just a little bit better for ordinary Americans.,9
2011-07-26,oba,They’re offended by that.,2
2011-07-26,oba,And they should be.,1
2011-07-26,oba,"The American people may have voted for divided government, but they didn’t vote for a dysfunctional government.",4
2011-07-26,oba,So I’m asking you all to make your voice heard.,4
2011-07-26,oba,"If you want a balanced approach to reducing the deficit, let your member of Congress know.",6
2011-07-26,oba,"If you believe we can solve this problem through compromise, send that message.",4
2011-07-26,oba,"America, after all, has always been a grand experiment in compromise.",3
2011-07-26,oba,"As a democracy made up of every race and religion, where every belief and point of view is welcomed, we have put to the test time and again the proposition at the heart of our founding:  that out of many, we are one.",10
2011-07-26,oba,"We’ve engaged in fierce and passionate debates about the issues of the day, but from slavery to war, from civil liberties to questions of economic justice, we have tried to live by the words that Jefferson once wrote:  “Every man cannot have his way in all things -- without this mutual disposition, we are disjointed individuals, but not a society.” 

History is scattered with the stories of those who held fast to rigid ideologies and refused to listen to those who disagreed.",10
2011-07-26,oba,But those are not the Americans we remember.,3
2011-07-26,oba,"We remember the Americans who put country above self, and set personal grievances aside for the greater good.",6
2011-07-26,oba,We remember the Americans who held this country together during its most difficult hours; who put aside pride and party to form a more perfect union.,6
2011-07-26,oba,That’s who we remember.,2
2011-07-26,oba,That’s who we need to be right now.,4
2011-07-26,oba,The entire world is watching.,2
2011-07-26,oba,"So let’s seize this moment to show why the United States of America is still the greatest nation on Earth –- not just because we can still keep our word and meet our obligations, but because we can still come together as one nation.",6

Tonight we meet at an urgent time for our country.",4

2011-09-09,oba,"This past week, reporters have been asking, “What will this speech mean for the President?",4
2011-09-09,oba,What will it mean for Congress?,2
2011-09-09,oba,"How will it affect their polls, and the next election?”

But the millions of Americans who are watching right now, they don’t care about politics.",2
2011-09-09,oba,They have real-life concerns.,3
2011-09-09,oba,Many have spent months looking for work.,3
2011-09-09,oba,Others are doing their best just to scrape by -- giving up nights out with the family to save on gas or make the mortgage; postponing retirement to send a kid to college.,5
2011-09-09,oba,These men and women grew up with faith in an America where hard work and responsibility paid off.,7
2011-09-09,oba,"They believed in a country where everyone gets a fair shake and does their fair share -- where if you stepped up, did your job, and were loyal to your company, that loyalty would be rewarded with a decent salary and good benefits; maybe a raise once in a while.",7

2011-09-09,oba,And they know that Washington has not always put their interests first.,3
2011-09-09,oba,The people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities.,4

2011-09-09,oba,The question is -- the question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning.,9
2011-09-09,oba,Those of us here tonight can’t solve all our nation’s woes.,3

2011-09-09,oba,We can make a difference.,2
2011-09-09,oba,There are steps we can take right now to improve people’s lives.,6
2011-09-09,oba,I am sending this Congress a plan that you should pass right away.,4
2011-09-09,oba,It’s called the American Jobs Act.,3
2011-09-09,oba,There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation.,6
2011-09-09,oba,Everything in here is the kind of proposal that’s been supported by both Democrats and Republicans -- including many who sit here tonight.,6
2011-09-09,oba,And everything in this bill will be paid for.,4
2011-09-09,oba,Everything.,1
2011-09-09,oba,The purpose of the American Jobs Act is simple:  to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working.,8
2011-09-09,oba,"It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for long-term unemployed.",8
2011-09-09,oba,"It will provide -- it will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working American and every small business.",6
2011-09-09,oba,"It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled, and give companies confidence that if they invest and if they hire, there will be customers for their products and services.",7
2011-09-09,oba,You should pass this jobs plan right away.,3
2011-09-09,oba,Everyone here knows that small businesses are where most new jobs begin.,4
2011-09-09,oba,"And you know that while corporate profits have come roaring back, smaller companies haven’t.",4
2011-09-09,oba,"So for everyone who speaks so passionately about making life easier for “job creators,” this plan is for you.",9
2011-09-09,oba,"Pass this jobs bill -- pass this jobs bill, and starting tomorrow, small businesses will get a tax cut if they hire new workers or if they raise workers’ wages.",4
2011-09-09,oba,"Pass this jobs bill, and all small business owners will also see their payroll taxes cut in half next year.",4
2011-09-09,oba,"If you have 50 employees -- if you have 50 employees making an average salary, that’s an $80,000 tax cut.",4
2011-09-09,oba,And all businesses will be able to continue writing off the investments they make in 2012.,6
2011-09-09,oba,It’s not just Democrats who have supported this kind of proposal.,5
2011-09-09,oba,Fifty House Republicans have proposed the same payroll tax cut that’s in this plan.,5
2011-09-09,oba,You should pass it right away.,2
2011-09-09,oba,"Pass this jobs bill, and we can put people to work rebuilding America.",4
2011-09-09,oba,Everyone here knows we have badly decaying roads and bridges all over the country.,5
2011-09-09,oba,Our highways are clogged with traffic.,2
2011-09-09,oba,Our skies are the most congested in the world.,4
2011-09-09,oba,It’s an outrage.,2
2011-09-09,oba,Building a world-class transportation system is part of what made us a economic superpower.,5
2011-09-09,oba,And now we’re going to sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads?,6
2011-09-09,oba,At a time when millions of unemployed construction workers could build them right here in America?,6
2011-09-09,oba,There are private construction companies all across America just waiting to get to work.,4
2011-09-09,oba,There’s a bridge that needs repair between Ohio and Kentucky that’s on one of the busiest trucking routes in North America.,9
2011-09-09,oba,A public transit project in Houston that will help clear up one of the worst areas of traffic in the country.,8
2011-09-09,oba,And there are schools throughout this country that desperately need renovating.,4
2011-09-09,oba,How can we expect our kids to do their best in places that are literally falling apart?,5
2011-09-09,oba,This is America.,1
2011-09-09,oba,"Every child deserves a great school -- and we can give it to them, if we act now.",3
2011-09-09,oba,"The American Jobs Act will repair and modernize at least 35,000 schools.",5
2011-09-09,oba,"It will put people to work right now fixing roofs and windows, installing science labs and high-speed Internet in classrooms all across this country.",7
2011-09-09,oba,It will rehabilitate homes and businesses in communities hit hardest by foreclosures.,4
2011-09-09,oba,It will jumpstart thousands of transportation projects all across the country.,4
2011-09-09,oba,"And to make sure the money is properly spent, we’re building on reforms we’ve already put in place.",5
2011-09-09,oba,No more earmarks.,2
2011-09-09,oba,No more boondoggles.,2
2011-09-09,oba,No more bridges to nowhere.,2
2011-09-09,oba,We’re cutting the red tape that prevents some of these projects from getting started as quickly as possible.,7
2011-09-09,oba,And we’ll set up an independent fund to attract private dollars and issue loans based on two criteria:  how badly a construction project is needed and how much good it will do for the economy.,8
2011-09-09,oba,This idea came from a bill written by a Texas Republican and a Massachusetts Democrat.,7
2011-09-09,oba,The idea for a big boost in construction is supported by America’s largest business organization and America’s largest labor organization.,5
2011-09-09,oba,It’s the kind of proposal that’s been supported in the past by Democrats and Republicans alike.,5
2011-09-09,oba,You should pass it right away.,2
2011-09-09,oba,"Pass this jobs bill, and thousands of teachers in every state will go back to work.",7
2011-09-09,oba,These are the men and women charged with preparing our children for a world where the competition has never been tougher.,9
2011-09-09,oba,"But while they’re adding teachers in places like South Korea, we’re laying them off in droves.",7
2011-09-09,oba,It’s unfair to our kids.,4
2011-09-09,oba,It undermines their future and ours.,2
2011-09-09,oba,And it has to stop.,2
2011-09-09,oba,"Pass this bill, and put our teachers back in the classroom where they belong.",6
2011-09-09,oba,"Pass this jobs bill, and companies will get extra tax credits if they hire America’s veterans.",5
2011-09-09,oba,"We ask these men and women to leave their careers, leave their families, risk their lives to fight for our country.",6
2011-09-09,oba,The last thing they should have to do is fight for a job when they come home.,4
2011-09-09,oba,"Pass this bill, and hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged young people will have the hope and the dignity of a summer job next year.",6
2011-09-09,oba,"And their parents -- their parents, low-income Americans who desperately want to work, will have more ladders out of poverty.",6
2011-09-09,oba,"Pass this jobs bill, and companies will get a $4,000 tax credit if they hire anyone who has spent more than six months looking for a job.",8
2011-09-09,oba,We have to do more to help the long-term unemployed in their search for work.,7
2011-09-09,oba,"This jobs plan builds on a program in Georgia that several Republican leaders have highlighted, where people who collect unemployment insurance participate in temporary work as a way to build their skills while they look for a permanent job.",9
2011-09-09,oba,The plan also extends unemployment insurance for another year.,3
2011-09-09,oba,"If the millions of unemployed Americans stopped getting this insurance, and stopped using that money for basic necessities, it would be a devastating blow to this economy.",6
2011-09-09,oba,Democrats and Republicans in this chamber have supported unemployment insurance plenty of times in the past.,4
2011-09-09,oba,"And in this time of prolonged hardship, you should pass it again -- right away.",5
2011-09-09,oba,"Pass this jobs bill, and the typical working family will get a $1,500 tax cut next year.",4
2011-09-09,oba,Fifteen hundred dollars that would have been taken out of your pocket will go into your pocket.,6
2011-09-09,oba,This expands on the tax cut that Democrats and Republicans already passed for this year.,6
2011-09-09,oba,If we allow that tax cut to expire -- if we refuse to act -- middle-class families will get hit with a tax increase at the worst possible time.,5
2011-09-09,oba,We can’t let that happen.,2
2011-09-09,oba,I know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live.,7
2011-09-09,oba,"Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle-class taxes, which is why you should pass this bill right away.",8
2011-09-09,oba,This is the American Jobs Act.,3
2011-09-09,oba,"It will lead to new jobs for construction workers, for teachers, for veterans, for first responders, young people and the long-term unemployed.",6
2011-09-09,oba,"It will provide tax credits to companies that hire new workers, tax relief to small business owners, and tax cuts for the middle class.",5
2011-09-09,oba,And here’s the other thing I want the American people to know: The American Jobs Act will not add to the deficit.,5
2011-09-09,oba,It will be paid for.,1
2011-09-09,oba,And here’s how.,1
2011-09-09,oba,The agreement we passed in July will cut government spending by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years.,4
2011-09-09,oba,It also charges this Congress to come up with an additional $1.5 trillion in savings by Christmas.,5
2011-09-09,oba,"Tonight, I am asking you to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the American Jobs Act.",6
2011-09-09,oba,"And a week from Monday, I’ll be releasing a more ambitious deficit plan -- a plan that will not only cover the cost of this jobs bill, but stabilize our debt in the long run.",7
2011-09-09,oba,This approach is basically the one I’ve been advocating for months.,4
2011-09-09,oba,"In addition to the trillion dollars of spending cuts I’ve already signed into law, it’s a balanced plan that would reduce the deficit by making additional spending cuts, by making modest adjustments to health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and by reforming our tax code in a way that asks the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share.",11
2011-09-09,oba,"What’s more, the spending cuts wouldn’t happen so abruptly that they’d be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from helping small businesses and middle-class families get back on their feet right away.",9
2011-09-09,oba,"Now, I realize there are some in my party who don’t think we should make any changes at all to Medicare and Medicaid, and I understand their concerns.",8
2011-09-09,oba,But here’s the truth:  Millions of Americans rely on Medicare in their retirement.,5
2011-09-09,oba,And millions more will do so in the future.,3
2011-09-09,oba,They pay for this benefit during their working years.,3
2011-09-09,oba,They earn it.,1
2011-09-09,oba,"But with an aging population and rising health care costs, we are spending too fast to sustain the program.",5
2011-09-09,oba,"And if we don’t gradually reform the system while protecting current beneficiaries, it won’t be there when future retirees need it.",3
2011-09-09,oba,We have to reform Medicare to strengthen it.,3
2011-09-09,oba,I am also -- I’m also well aware that there are many Republicans who don’t believe we should raise taxes on those who are most fortunate and can best afford it.,10
2011-09-09,oba,"But here is what every American knows:  While most people in this country struggle to make ends meet, a few of the most affluent citizens and most profitable corporations enjoy tax breaks and loopholes that nobody else gets.",6
2011-09-09,oba,"Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary -- an outrage he has asked us to fix.",4
2011-09-09,oba,We need a tax code where everyone gets a fair shake and where everybody pays their fair share.,5
2011-09-09,oba,"And by the way, I believe the vast majority of wealthy Americans and CEOs are willing to do just that if it helps the economy grow and gets our fiscal house in order.",5
2011-09-09,oba,I’ll also offer ideas to reform a corporate tax code that stands as a monument to special interest influence in Washington.,9
2011-09-09,oba,"By eliminating pages of loopholes and deductions, we can lower one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.",6
2011-09-09,oba,Our tax code should not give an advantage to companies that can afford the best-connected lobbyists.,6
2011-09-09,oba,It should give an advantage to companies that invest and create jobs right here in the United States of America.,9
2011-09-09,oba,"So we can reduce this deficit, pay down our debt, and pay for this jobs plan in the process.",7
2011-09-09,oba,"But in order to do this, we have to decide what our priorities are.",4
2011-09-09,oba,"We have to ask ourselves, “What’s the best way to grow the economy and create jobs?”

Should we keep tax loopholes for oil companies?",6
2011-09-09,oba,Or should we use that money to give small business owners a tax credit when they hire new workers?,4
2011-09-09,oba,Because we can’t afford to do both.,2
2011-09-09,oba,Should we keep tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires?,4
2011-09-09,oba,Or should we put teachers back to work so our kids can graduate ready for college and good jobs?,6
2011-09-09,oba,"Right now, we can’t afford to do both.",2
2011-09-09,oba,This isn’t political grandstanding.,2
2011-09-09,oba,This isn’t class warfare.,2
2011-09-09,oba,This is simple math.,2
2011-09-09,oba,This is simple math.,2
2011-09-09,oba,These are real choices.,2
2011-09-09,oba,These are real choices that we’ve got to make.,4
2011-09-09,oba,And I’m pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose.,5
2011-09-09,oba,It’s not even close.,2
2011-09-09,oba,And it’s time for us to do what’s right for our future.,7
2011-09-09,oba,"Now, the American Jobs Act answers the urgent need to create jobs right away.",4
2011-09-09,oba,But we can’t stop there.,1
2011-09-09,oba,"As I’ve argued since I ran for this office, we have to look beyond the immediate crisis and start building an economy that lasts into the future -- an economy that creates good, middle-class jobs that pay well and offer security.",13
2011-09-09,oba,We now live in a world where technology has made it possible for companies to take their business anywhere.,7
2011-09-09,oba,"If we want them to start here and stay here and hire here, we have to be able to out-build and out-educate and out-innovate every other country on Earth.",5
2011-09-09,oba,"And this task of making America more competitive for the long haul, that’s a job for all of us.",7
2011-09-09,oba,For government and for private companies.,3
2011-09-09,oba,For states and for local communities -- and for every American citizen.,3
2011-09-09,oba,All of us will have to up our game.,3
2011-09-09,oba,All of us will have to change the way we do business.,4
2011-09-09,oba,My administration can and will take some steps to improve our competitiveness on our own.,6
2011-09-09,oba,"For example, if you’re a small business owner who has a contract with the federal government, we’re going to make sure you get paid a lot faster than you do right now.",7
2011-09-09,oba,We’re also planning to cut away the red tape that prevents too many rapidly growing startup companies from raising capital and going public.,7
2011-09-09,oba,"And to help responsible homeowners, we’re going to work with federal housing agencies to help more people refinance their mortgages at interest rates that are now near 4 percent.",9
2011-09-09,oba,"That’s a step -- I know you guys must be for this, because that’s a step that can put more than $2,000 a year in a family’s pocket, and give a lift to an economy still burdened by the drop in housing prices.",11
2011-09-09,oba,"So, some things we can do on our own.",4
2011-09-09,oba,Other steps will require congressional action.,2
2011-09-09,oba,"Today you passed reform that will speed up the outdated patent process, so that entrepreneurs can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as possible.",6
2011-09-09,oba,That’s the kind of action we need.,3
2011-09-09,oba,Now it’s time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in Panama and Colombia and South Korea -– while also helping the workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition.,14
2011-09-09,oba,"If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, I want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and Chryslers.",6
2011-09-09,oba,I want to see more products sold around the world stamped with the three proud words:  “Made in America.”  That’s what we need to get done.,8
2011-09-09,oba,"And on all of our efforts to strengthen competitiveness, we need to look for ways to work side by side with America’s businesses.",8
2011-09-09,oba,That’s why I’ve brought together a Jobs Council of leaders from different industries who are developing a wide range of new ideas to help companies grow and create jobs.,8
2011-09-09,oba,"Already, we’ve mobilized business leaders to train 10,000 American engineers a year, by providing company internships and training.",4
2011-09-09,oba,Other businesses are covering tuition for workers who learn new skills at community colleges.,7
2011-09-09,oba,"And we’re going to make sure the next generation of manufacturing takes root not in China or Europe, but right here, in the United States of America.",6
2011-09-09,oba,"If we provide the right incentives, the right support -- and if we make sure our trading partners play by the rules -- we can be the ones to build everything from fuel-efficient cars to advanced biofuels to semiconductors that we sell all around the world.",8
2011-09-09,oba,That’s how America can be number one again.,3
2011-09-09,oba,And that’s how America will be number one again.,3
2011-09-09,oba,"Now, I realize that some of you have a different theory on how to grow the economy.",6
2011-09-09,oba,Some of you sincerely believe that the only solution to our economic challenges is to simply cut most government spending and eliminate most government regulations.,5
2011-09-09,oba,"Well, I agree that we can’t afford wasteful spending, and I’ll work with you, with Congress, to root it out.",3
2011-09-09,oba,And I agree that there are some rules and regulations that do put an unnecessary burden on businesses at a time when they can least afford it.,7
2011-09-09,oba,That’s why I ordered a review of all government regulations.,5
2011-09-09,oba,"So far, we’ve identified over 500 reforms, which will save billions of dollars over the next few years.",5
2011-09-09,oba,"We should have no more regulation than the health, safety and security of the American people require.",6
2011-09-09,oba,Every rule should meet that common-sense test.,3
2011-09-09,oba,But what we can’t do -- what I will not do -- is let this economic crisis be used as an excuse to wipe out the basic protections that Americans have counted on for decades.,8
2011-09-09,oba,I reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between their jobs and their safety.,8
2011-09-09,oba,"I reject the argument that says for the economy to grow, we have to roll back protections that ban hidden fees by credit card companies, or rules that keep our kids from being exposed to mercury, or laws that prevent the health insurance industry from shortchanging patients.",17
2011-09-09,oba,I reject the idea that we have to strip away collective bargaining rights to compete in a global economy.,7
2011-09-09,oba,"We shouldn’t be in a race to the bottom, where we try to offer the cheapest labor and the worst pollution standards.",9
2011-09-09,oba,America should be in a race to the top.,5
2011-09-09,oba,And I believe we can win that race.,3
2011-09-09,oba,"In fact, this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle government, refund everybody’s money, and let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone they’re on their own -- that’s not who we are.",6
2011-09-09,oba,That’s not the story of America.,3
2011-09-09,oba,"Yes, we are rugged individualists.",2
2011-09-09,oba,"Yes, we are strong and self-reliant.",3
2011-09-09,oba,And it has been the drive and initiative of our workers and entrepreneurs that has made this economy the engine and the envy of the world.,7
2011-09-09,oba,"But there’s always been another thread running throughout our history -- a belief that we’re all connected, and that there are some things we can only do together, as a nation.",5
2011-09-09,oba,We all remember Abraham Lincoln as the leader who saved our Union.,6
2011-09-09,oba,Founder of the Republican Party.,3
2011-09-09,oba,"But in the middle of a civil war, he was also a leader who looked to the future -- a Republican President who mobilized government to build the Transcontinental Railroad -- launch the National Academy of Sciences, set up the first land grant colleges.",6
2011-09-09,oba,And leaders of both parties have followed the example he set.,4
2011-09-09,oba,"Ask yourselves -- where would we be right now if the people who sat here before us decided not to build our highways, not to build our bridges, our dams, our airports?",7
2011-09-09,oba,"What would this country be like if we had chosen not to spend money on public high schools, or research universities, or community colleges?",7
2011-09-09,oba,"Millions of returning heroes, including my grandfather, had the opportunity to go to school because of the G.I.",6
2011-09-09,oba,Bill.,1
2011-09-09,oba,Where would we be if they hadn’t had that chance?,3
2011-09-09,oba,How many jobs would it have cost us if past Congresses decided not to support the basic research that led to the Internet and the computer chip?,8
2011-09-09,oba,What kind of country would this be if this chamber had voted down Social Security or Medicare just because it violated some rigid idea about what government could or could not do?,7
2011-09-09,oba,How many Americans would have suffered as a result?,3
2011-09-09,oba,No single individual built America on their own.,3
2011-09-09,oba,We built it together.,1
2011-09-09,oba,"We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another.",9
2011-09-09,oba,"And members of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.",4
2011-09-09,oba,Every proposal I’ve laid out tonight is the kind that’s been supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past.,5
2011-09-09,oba,Every proposal I’ve laid out tonight will be paid for.,3
2011-09-09,oba,And every proposal is designed to meet the urgent needs of our people and our communities.,6
2011-09-09,oba,"Now, I know there’s been a lot of skepticism about whether the politics of the moment will allow us to pass this jobs plan -- or any jobs plan.",8
2011-09-09,oba,"Already, we’re seeing the same old press releases and tweets flying back and forth.",3
2011-09-09,oba,"Already, the media has proclaimed that it’s impossible to bridge our differences.",4
2011-09-09,oba,And maybe some of you have decided that those differences are so great that we can only resolve them at the ballot box.,6
2011-09-09,oba,But know this:  The next election is 14 months away.,5
2011-09-09,oba,And the people who sent us here -- the people who hired us to work for them -- they don’t have the luxury of waiting 14 months.,6
2011-09-09,oba,"Some of them are living week to week, paycheck to paycheck, even day to day.",3
2011-09-09,oba,"They need help, and they need it now.",2
2011-09-09,oba,I don’t pretend that this plan will solve all our problems.,3
2011-09-09,oba,"It should not be, nor will it be, the last plan of action we propose.",4
2011-09-09,oba,What’s guided us from the start of this crisis hasn’t been the search for a silver bullet.,6
2011-09-09,oba,"It’s been a commitment to stay at it -- to be persistent -- to keep trying every new idea that works, and listen to every good proposal, no matter which party comes up with it.",10
2011-09-09,oba,"Regardless of the arguments we’ve had in the past, regardless of the arguments we will have in the future, this plan is the right thing to do right now.",7
2011-09-09,oba,You should pass it.,1
2011-09-09,oba,And I intend to take that message to every corner of this country.,6
2011-09-09,oba,And I ask -- I ask every American who agrees to lift your voice:  Tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want action now.,6
2011-09-09,oba,Tell Washington that doing nothing is not an option.,3
2011-09-09,oba,"Remind us that if we act as one nation and one people, we have it within our power to meet this challenge.",6
2011-09-09,oba,"President Kennedy once said, “Our problems are man-made -- therefore they can be solved by man.",4
2011-09-09,oba,"And man can be as big as he wants.”

These are difficult years for our country.",3

2011-10-17,oba,"In this place, he will stand for all time, among monuments to those who fathered this nation and those who defended it; a black preacher with no official rank or title who somehow gave voice to our deepest dreams and our most lasting ideals, a man who stirred our conscience and thereby helped make our union more perfect.",18
2011-10-17,oba,And Dr. King would be the first to remind us that this memorial is not for him alone.,5

2011-10-17,oba,"“By the thousands,” said Dr. King, “faceless, anonymous, relentless young people, black and white...have taken our whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in the formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.”  To those men and women, to those foot soldiers for justice, know that this monument is yours, as well.",14

2011-10-17,oba,"It is right that we honor that march, that we lift up Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech -- for without that shining moment, without Dr. King’s glorious words, we might not have had the courage to come as far as we have.",3
2011-10-17,oba,"Because of that hopeful vision, because of Dr. King’s moral imagination, barricades began to fall and bigotry began to fade.",4
2011-10-17,oba,New doors of opportunity swung open for an entire generation.,3
2011-10-17,oba,"Yes, laws changed, but hearts and minds changed, as well.",3
2011-10-17,oba,"Look at the faces here around you, and you see an America that is more fair and more free and more just than the one Dr. King addressed that day.",9
2011-10-17,oba,"We are right to savor that slow but certain progress -- progress that’s expressed itself in a million ways, large and small, across this nation every single day, as people of all colors and creeds live together, and work together, and fight alongside one another, and learn together, and build together, and love one another.",8
2011-10-17,oba,So it is right for us to celebrate today Dr. King’s dream and his vision of unity.,5
2011-10-17,oba,And yet it is also important on this day to remind ourselves that such progress did not come easily; that Dr. King’s faith was hard-won; that it sprung out of a harsh reality and some bitter disappointments.,5
2011-10-17,oba,"It is right for us to celebrate Dr. King’s marvelous oratory, but it is worth remembering that progress did not come from words alone.",6
2011-10-17,oba,Progress was hard.,1
2011-10-17,oba,Progress was purchased through enduring the smack of billy clubs and the blast of fire hoses.,9
2011-10-17,oba,It was bought with days in jail cells and nights of bomb threats.,8
2011-10-17,oba,"For every victory during the height of the civil rights movement, there were setbacks and there were defeats.",8
2011-10-17,oba,"We forget now, but during his life, Dr. King wasn’t always considered a unifying figure.",4
2011-10-17,oba,"Even after rising to prominence, even after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. King was vilified by many, denounced as a rabble rouser and an agitator, a communist and a radical.",7
2011-10-17,oba,"He was even attacked by his own people, by those who felt he was going too fast or those who felt he was going too slow; by those who felt he shouldn’t meddle in issues like the Vietnam War or the rights of union workers.",12
2011-10-17,oba,"We know from his own testimony the doubts and the pain this caused him, and that the controversy that would swirl around his actions would last until the fateful day he died.",8
2011-10-17,oba,"I raise all this because nearly 50 years after the March on Washington, our work, Dr. King’s work, is not yet complete.",6
2011-10-17,oba,We gather here at a moment of great challenge and great change.,6
2011-10-17,oba,"In the first decade of this new century, we have been tested by war and by tragedy; by an economic crisis and its aftermath that has left millions out of work, and poverty on the rise, and millions more just struggling to get by.",7
2011-10-17,oba,"Indeed, even before this crisis struck, we had endured a decade of rising inequality and stagnant wages.",5
2011-10-17,oba,"In too many troubled neighborhoods across the country, the conditions of our poorest citizens appear little changed from what existed 50 years ago -- neighborhoods with underfunded schools and broken-down slums, inadequate health care, constant violence, neighborhoods in which too many young people grow up with little hope and few prospects for the future.",11
2011-10-17,oba,Our work is not done.,2
2011-10-17,oba,"And so on this day, in which we celebrate a man and a movement that did so much for this country, let us draw strength from those earlier struggles.",7
2011-10-17,oba,"First and foremost, let us remember that change has never been quick.",3
2011-10-17,oba,"Change has never been simple, or without controversy.",3
2011-10-17,oba,Change depends on persistence.,2
2011-10-17,oba,Change requires determination.,1
2011-10-17,oba,"It took a full decade before the moral guidance of Brown v. Board of Education was translated into the enforcement measures of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, but those 10 long years did not lead Dr. King to give up.",8
2011-10-17,oba,"He kept on pushing, he kept on speaking, he kept on marching until change finally came.",3
2011-10-17,oba,"And then when, even after the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act passed, African Americans still found themselves trapped in pockets of poverty across the country, Dr. King didn’t say those laws were a failure; he didn’t say this is too hard; he didn’t say, let’s settle for what we got and go home.",10
2011-10-17,oba,"Instead he said, let’s take those victories and broaden our mission to achieve not just civil and political equality but also economic justice; let’s fight for a living wage and better schools and jobs for all who are willing to work.",8
2011-10-17,oba,"In other words, when met with hardship, when confronting disappointment, Dr. King refused to accept what he called the “isness” of today.",5
2011-10-17,oba,He kept pushing towards the “oughtness” of tomorrow.,5
2011-10-17,oba,"And so, as we think about all the work that we must do -- rebuilding an economy that can compete on a global stage, and fixing our schools so that every child -- not just some, but every child -- gets a world-class education, and making sure that our health care system is affordable and accessible to all, and that our economic system is one in which everybody gets a fair shake and everybody does their fair share, let us not be trapped by what is.",12
2011-10-17,oba,We can’t be discouraged by what is.,3
2011-10-17,oba,"We’ve got to keep pushing for what ought to be, the America we ought to leave to our children, mindful that the hardships we face are nothing compared to those Dr. King and his fellow marchers faced 50 years ago, and that if we maintain our faith, in ourselves and in the possibilities of this nation, there is no challenge we cannot surmount.",11
2011-10-17,oba,"And just as we draw strength from Dr. King’s struggles, so must we draw inspiration from his constant insistence on the oneness of man; the belief in his words that “we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.”  It was that insistence, rooted in his Christian faith, that led him to tell a group of angry young protesters, “I love you as I love my own children,” even as one threw a rock that glanced off his neck.",7
2011-10-17,oba,"It was that insistence, that belief that God resides in each of us, from the high to the low, in the oppressor and the oppressed, that convinced him that people and systems could change.",9
2011-10-17,oba,It fortified his belief in non-violence.,3
2011-10-17,oba,It permitted him to place his faith in a government that had fallen short of its ideals.,9
2011-10-17,oba,"It led him to see his charge not only as freeing black America from the shackles of discrimination, but also freeing many Americans from their own prejudices, and freeing Americans of every color from the depredations of poverty.",12
2011-10-17,oba,"And so at this moment, when our politics appear so sharply polarized, and faith in our institutions so greatly diminished, we need more than ever to take heed of Dr. King’s teachings.",6
2011-10-17,oba,He calls on us to stand in the other person’s shoes; to see through their eyes; to understand their pain.,5
2011-10-17,oba,"He tells us that we have a duty to fight against poverty, even if we are well off; to care about the child in the decrepit school even if our own children are doing fine; to show compassion toward the immigrant family, with the knowledge that most of us are only a few generations removed from similar hardships.",9
2011-10-17,oba,"To say that we are bound together as one people, and must constantly strive to see ourselves in one another, is not to argue for a false unity that papers over our differences and ratifies an unjust status quo.",7
2011-10-17,oba,"As was true 50 years ago, as has been true throughout human history, those with power and privilege will often decry any call for change as “divisive.”  They’ll say any challenge to the existing arrangements are unwise and destabilizing.",5
2011-10-17,oba,Dr. King understood that peace without justice was no peace at all; that aligning our reality with our ideals often requires the speaking of uncomfortable truths and the creative tension of non-violent protest.,5
2011-10-17,oba,"But he also understood that to bring about true and lasting change, there must be the possibility of reconciliation; that any social movement has to channel this tension through the spirit of love and mutuality.",6
2011-10-17,oba,"If he were alive today, I believe he would remind us that the unemployed worker can rightly challenge the excesses of Wall Street without demonizing all who work there; that the businessman can enter tough negotiations with his company’s union without vilifying the right to collectively bargain.",8
2011-10-17,oba,"He would want us to know we can argue fiercely about the proper size and role of government without questioning each other’s love for this country -- with the knowledge that in this democracy, government is no distant object but is rather an expression of our common commitments to one another.",10
2011-10-17,oba,"He would call on us to assume the best in each other rather than the worst, and challenge one another in ways that ultimately heal rather than wound.",6
2011-10-17,oba,"In the end, that’s what I hope my daughters take away from this monument.",6
2011-10-17,oba,I want them to come away from here with a faith in what they can accomplish when they are determined and working for a righteous cause.,10
2011-10-17,oba,I want them to come away from here with a faith in other people and a faith in a benevolent God.,7
2011-10-17,oba,"This sculpture, massive and iconic as it is, will remind them of Dr. King’s strength, but to see him only as larger than life would do a disservice to what he taught us about ourselves.",5
2011-10-17,oba,"He would want them to know that he had setbacks, because they will have setbacks.",3
2011-10-17,oba,"He would want them to know that he had doubts, because they will have doubts.",3
2011-10-17,oba,"He would want them to know that he was flawed, because all of us have flaws.",4
2011-10-17,oba,It is precisely because Dr. King was a man of flesh and blood and not a figure of stone that he inspires us so.,5
2011-10-17,oba,"His life, his story, tells us that change can come if you don’t give up.",3
2011-10-17,oba,"He would not give up, no matter how long it took, because in the smallest hamlets and the darkest slums, he had witnessed the highest reaches of the human spirit; because in those moments when the struggle seemed most hopeless, he had seen men and women and children conquer their fear; because he had seen hills and mountains made low and rough places made plain, and the crooked places made straight and God make a way out of no way.",8
2011-10-17,oba,And that is why we honor this man -- because he had faith in us.,4
2011-10-17,oba,And that is why he belongs on this Mall -- because he saw what we might become.,4
2011-10-17,oba,"That is why Dr. King was so quintessentially American -- because for all the hardships we’ve endured, for all our sometimes tragic history, ours is a story of optimism and achievement and constant striving that is unique upon this Earth.",7
2011-10-17,oba,And that is why the rest of the world still looks to us to lead.,5
2011-10-17,oba,"This is a country where ordinary people find in their hearts the courage to do extraordinary things; the courage to stand up in the face of the fiercest resistance and despair and say this is wrong, and this is right; we will not settle for what the cynics tell us we have to accept and we will reach again and again, no matter the odds, for what we know is possible.",7
2011-10-17,oba,That is the conviction we must carry now in our hearts.,5
2011-10-17,oba,"As tough as times may be, I know we will overcome.",3
2011-10-17,oba,I know there are better days ahead.,4
2011-10-17,oba,I know this because of the man towering over us.,5
2011-10-17,oba,I know this because all he and his generation endured -- we are here today in a country that dedicated a monument to that legacy.,8
2011-10-17,oba,"And so with our eyes on the horizon and our faith squarely placed in one another, let us keep striving; let us keep struggling; let us keep climbing toward that promised land of a nation and a world that is more fair, and more just, and more equal for every single child of God.",8

2012-01-06,oba,"Indeed, all of us on this stage -- every single one of us -- have a profound responsibility to every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine and Coast Guardsman who puts their life on the line for America.",8
2012-01-06,oba,We owe them a strategy with well-defined goals; to only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary; to give them the equipment and the support that they need to get the job done; and to care for them and their families when they come home.,9
2012-01-06,oba,That is our solemn obligation.,2
2012-01-06,oba,"And over the past three years, that's what we've done.",3
2012-01-06,oba,"We've continued to make historic investments in our military -- our troops and their capabilities, our military families and our veterans.",6
2012-01-06,oba,"And thanks to their extraordinary service, we've ended our war in Iraq.",4
2012-01-06,oba,We've decimated al Qaeda's leadership.,3
2012-01-06,oba,"We've delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, and we've put that terrorist network on the path to defeat.",4

2012-01-06,oba,We joined allies and partners to protect the Libyan people as they ended the regime of Muammar Qaddafi.,6
2012-01-06,oba,Now we're turning the page on a decade of war.,4
2012-01-06,oba,"Three years ago, we had some 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.",4
2012-01-06,oba,"Today, we've cut that number in half.",2
2012-01-06,oba,"And as the transition in Afghanistan continues, more of our troops will continue to come home.",4
2012-01-06,oba,"More broadly, around the globe we've strengthened alliances, forged new partnerships, and served as a force for universal rights and human dignity.",7
2012-01-06,oba,"In short, we've succeeded in defending our nation, taking the fight to our enemies, reducing the number of Americans in harm's way, and we've restored America's global leadership.",6
2012-01-06,oba,That makes us safer and it makes us stronger.,3
2012-01-06,oba,And that's an achievement that every American -- especially those Americans who are proud to wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces -- should take great pride in.,12
2012-01-06,oba,"This success has brought our nation, once more, to a moment of transition.",4
2012-01-06,oba,"Even as our troops continue to fight in Afghanistan, the tide of war is receding.",5
2012-01-06,oba,"Even as our forces prevail in today's missions, we have the opportunity -- and the responsibility -- to look ahead to the force that we are going to need in the future.",10
2012-01-06,oba,"At the same time, we have to renew our economic strength here at home, which is the foundation of our strength around the world.",9
2012-01-06,oba,And that includes putting our fiscal house in order.,3
2012-01-06,oba,"To that end, the Budget Control Act passed by Congress last year -- with the support of Republicans and Democrats alike -- mandates reductions in federal spending, including defense spending.",6
2012-01-06,oba,I've insisted that we do that responsibly.,2
2012-01-06,oba,The security of our nation and the lives of our men and women in uniform depend on it.,6
2012-01-06,oba,"That's why I called for this comprehensive defense review -- to clarify our strategic interests in a fast-changing world, and to guide our defense priorities and spending over the coming decade -- because the size and the structure of our military and defense budgets have to be driven by a strategy, not the other way around.",7
2012-01-06,oba,"Moreover, we have to remember the lessons of history.",4
2012-01-06,oba,"We can't afford to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past -- after World War II, after Vietnam -- when our military was left ill prepared for the future.",8
2012-01-06,oba,"As Commander in Chief, I will not let that happen again.",4
2012-01-06,oba,Not on my watch.,2
2012-01-06,oba,"We need a start -- we need a smart, strategic set of priorities.",3
2012-01-06,oba,The new guidance that the Defense Department is releasing today does just that.,4
2012-01-06,oba,I want to thank Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey for their extraordinary leadership during this process.,4
2012-01-06,oba,"I want to thank the service secretaries and chiefs, the combatant commanders and so many defense leaders -- military and civilian, active, Guard and reserve -- for their contributions.",8
2012-01-06,oba,"Many of us met repeatedly -- asking tough questions, challenging our own assumptions and making hard choices.",5
2012-01-06,oba,And we've come together today around an approach that will keep our nation safe and our military the finest that the world have ever known.,8
2012-01-06,oba,"This review also benefits from the contributions of leaders from across my national security team -- from the departments of State, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, as well as the intelligence community.",7
2012-01-06,oba,"And this is critical, because meeting the challenges of our time cannot be the work of our military alone -- or the United States alone.",6
2012-01-06,oba,"It requires all elements of our national power, working together in concert with our allies and our partners.",7
2012-01-06,oba,So I'm going to let Leon and Marty go into the details.,5
2012-01-06,oba,But I just want to say that this effort reflects the guidance that I personally gave throughout this process.,7
2012-01-06,oba,"Yes, the tide of war is receding.",3
2012-01-06,oba,But the question that this strategy answers is what kind of military will we need long after the wars of the last decade are over.,7
2012-01-06,oba,"And today, we're fortunate to be moving forward from a position of strength.",6
2012-01-06,oba,"As I made clear in Australia, we will be strengthening our presence in the Asia Pacific, and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical region.",6
2012-01-06,oba,"We're going to continue investing in our critical partnerships and alliances, including NATO, which has demonstrated time and again -- most recently in Libya -- that it's a force multiplier.",9
2012-01-06,oba,"We will stay vigilant, especially in the Middle East.",3
2012-01-06,oba,As we look beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and the end of long-term nation-building with large military footprints -- we'll be able to ensure our security with smaller conventional ground forces.,7
2012-01-06,oba,"We'll continue to get rid of outdated Cold War-era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities that we need for the future, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, counterterrorism, countering weapons of mass destruction and the ability to operate in environments where adversaries try to deny us access.",14
2012-01-06,oba,"So, yes, our military will be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to maintain our military superiority with armed forces that are agile, flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats.",12
2012-01-06,oba,"We're also going to keep faith with those who serve, by making sure our troops have the equipment and capabilities they need to succeed, and by prioritizing efforts that focus on wounded warriors, mental health and the well-being of our military families.",11
2012-01-06,oba,"And as our newest veterans rejoin civilian life, we'll keep working to give our veterans the care, the benefits and job opportunities that they deserve and that they have earned.",6
2012-01-06,oba,"Finally, although today is about our defense strategy, I want to close with a word about the defense budget that will flow from this strategy.",9
2012-01-06,oba,The details will be announced in the coming weeks.,3
2012-01-06,oba,Some will no doubt say that the spending reductions are too big; others will say that they're too small.,4
2012-01-06,oba,It will be easy to take issue with a particular change in a particular program.,6

2012-01-25,oba,The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive.,4

2012-01-25,oba,"In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs.",4
2012-01-25,oba,And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect.,4

2012-01-25,oba,"And tonight, the American auto industry is back.",2
2012-01-25,oba,What’s happening in Detroit can happen in other industries.,3
2012-01-25,oba,It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.,4
2012-01-25,oba,We can’t bring every job back that’s left our shore.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"But right now, it’s getting more expensive to do business in places like China.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"Meanwhile, America is more productive.",2
2012-01-25,oba,"A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock’s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back.",3
2012-01-25,oba,But we have to seize it.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.",6
2012-01-25,oba,We should start with our tax code.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.",2
2012-01-25,oba,So let’s change it.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"First, if you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a tax deduction for doing it.",5
2012-01-25,oba,That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.,7
2012-01-25,oba,"Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas.",8
2012-01-25,oba,"From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax.",3
2012-01-25,oba,And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.,10
2012-01-25,oba,"Third, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut.",3
2012-01-25,oba,"If you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.",8
2012-01-25,oba,So my message is simple.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away.",3
2012-01-25,oba,We’re also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world.,5
2012-01-25,oba,"Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"And soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.",10
2012-01-25,oba,"Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.",6
2012-01-25,oba,I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products.,5
2012-01-25,oba,And I will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the rules.,4
2012-01-25,oba,We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last Administration -- and it’s made a difference.,5
2012-01-25,oba,Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.,4
2012-01-25,oba,But we need to do more.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"It’s not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated.",5
2012-01-25,oba,It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they’re heavily subsidized.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.",11
2012-01-25,oba,There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.,6
2012-01-25,oba,And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia.,9
2012-01-25,oba,"Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you -- America will always win.",4
2012-01-25,oba,I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can’t find workers with the right skills.,7
2012-01-25,oba,Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job.,6
2012-01-25,oba,Think about that -- openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.,7
2012-01-25,oba,It’s inexcusable.,1
2012-01-25,oba,And we know how to fix it.,2
2012-01-25,oba,Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic.,5
2012-01-25,oba,"Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.",5
2012-01-25,oba,The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training.,5
2012-01-25,oba,"It paid Jackie’s tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.",5
2012-01-25,oba,I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did.,5
2012-01-25,oba,Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job.,9
2012-01-25,oba,My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and running.",11
2012-01-25,oba,"Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers -- places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.",13
2012-01-25,oba,"And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help that they need.",8
2012-01-25,oba,It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.,7
2012-01-25,oba,These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the first time that’s happened in a generation.",6
2012-01-25,oba,But challenges remain.,1
2012-01-25,oba,And we know how to solve them.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over 250,000 dollars.",5
2012-01-25,oba,A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.,7
2012-01-25,oba,Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives.,7
2012-01-25,oba,"Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make a difference.",6
2012-01-25,oba,Teachers matter.,1
2012-01-25,oba,"So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let’s offer schools a deal.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"And in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.",6
2012-01-25,oba,That’s a bargain worth making.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"We also know that when students don’t walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better.",3
2012-01-25,oba,"So tonight, I am proposing that every state -- every state -- requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college.",3
2012-01-25,oba,"At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle-class families thousands of dollars, and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.",13
2012-01-25,oba,"Of course, it’s not enough for us to increase student aid.",3
2012-01-25,oba,We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of money.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets.",7
2012-01-25,oba,And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down.,5
2012-01-25,oba,"Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that.",5
2012-01-25,oba,Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly.,4
2012-01-25,oba,Some use better technology.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"The point is, it’s possible.",2
2012-01-25,oba,"So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down.",5
2012-01-25,oba,Higher education can’t be a luxury -- it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"Let’s also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact that they aren’t yet American citizens.",9
2012-01-25,oba,"Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.",5
2012-01-25,oba,That doesn’t make sense.,1
2012-01-25,oba,I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration.,4
2012-01-25,oba,That’s why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before.,5
2012-01-25,oba,That’s why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.,5
2012-01-25,oba,The opponents of action are out of excuses.,3
2012-01-25,oba,We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let’s at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country.",8
2012-01-25,oba,Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship.,6
2012-01-25,oba,I will sign it right away.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country.",8
2012-01-25,oba,That means women should earn equal pay for equal work.,5
2012-01-25,oba,"It means we should support everyone who’s willing to work, and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"After all, innovation is what America has always been about.",3
2012-01-25,oba,Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses.,4
2012-01-25,oba,So let’s pass an agenda that helps them succeed.,5
2012-01-25,oba,Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow.,7
2012-01-25,oba,Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs.,6
2012-01-25,oba,Both parties agree on these ideas.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year.",4
2012-01-25,oba,Innovation also demands basic research.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.",6
2012-01-25,oba,New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.,3
2012-01-25,oba,Don’t gut these investments in our budget.,3
2012-01-25,oba,Don’t let other countries win the race for the future.,5
2012-01-25,oba,Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.,6
2012-01-25,oba,And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.,7
2012-01-25,oba,"Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my Administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.",7
2012-01-25,oba,Right now -- right now -- American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years.,5
2012-01-25,oba,That’s right -- eight years.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"Not only that -- last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"But with only 2 percent of the world’s oil reserves, oil isn’t enough.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.",7
2012-01-25,oba,We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years.,5
2012-01-25,oba,And my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade.",6
2012-01-25,oba,And I’m requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.,6
2012-01-25,oba,Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.,6
2012-01-25,oba,"The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don’t have to choose between our environment and our economy.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock –- reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.",10
2012-01-25,oba,"Now, what’s true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance.",5

2012-01-25,oba,Some technologies don’t pan out; some companies fail.,3
2012-01-25,oba,But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.,6
2012-01-25,oba,I will not walk away from workers like Bryan.,5
2012-01-25,oba,I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here.,4
2012-01-25,oba,We’ve subsidized oil companies for a century.,3
2012-01-25,oba,That’s long enough.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"It’s time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising.",12
2012-01-25,oba,Pass clean energy tax credits.,2
2012-01-25,oba,Create these jobs.,2
2012-01-25,oba,We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives.,3
2012-01-25,oba,The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.,5
2012-01-25,oba,But there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.,7
2012-01-25,oba,"So far, you haven’t acted.",2
2012-01-25,oba,"Well, tonight, I will.",1
2012-01-25,oba,I’m directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes.,6
2012-01-25,oba,"And I’m proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history -- with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.",12
2012-01-25,oba,"Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy.",3
2012-01-25,oba,So here’s a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.,6
2012-01-25,oba,"Their energy bills will be 100 billion dollars lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them.",8
2012-01-25,oba,Send me a bill that creates these jobs.,4
2012-01-25,oba,Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.,7
2012-01-25,oba,So much of America needs to be rebuilt.,3
2012-01-25,oba,We’ve got crumbling roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.,8

2012-01-25,oba,But you need to fund these projects.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"Take the money we’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"There’s never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"Of course, construction workers weren’t the only ones who were hurt.",3
2012-01-25,oba,So were millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values decline.,7
2012-01-25,oba,"And while government can’t fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.",6

2012-01-25,oba,No more runaround from the banks.,3
2012-01-25,oba,A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won’t add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.,7
2012-01-25,oba,Let’s never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same.,8
2012-01-25,oba,It’s time to apply the same rules from top to bottom.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts.",3

2012-01-25,oba,That’s why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior.,5
2012-01-25,oba,Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices -- these don’t destroy the free market.,6
2012-01-25,oba,They make the free market work better.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"There’s no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his.",5

2012-01-25,oba,"Now, I’m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder.",8
2012-01-25,oba,Absolutely.,1

2012-01-25,oba,"I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men.",8
2012-01-25,oba,And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules.,9
2012-01-25,oba,"The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system’s core purpose:  Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, or start a business, or send their kids to college.",10
2012-01-25,oba,"So if you are a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.",5
2012-01-25,oba,You’re required to write out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you fail -- because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again.,4

2012-01-25,oba,"Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: to look out for them.",5
2012-01-25,oba,We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.,5
2012-01-25,oba,Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no real penalty for being a repeat offender.,6
2012-01-25,oba,"That’s bad for consumers, and it’s bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing.",8
2012-01-25,oba,So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.,6
2012-01-25,oba,"And tonight, I’m asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis.",10

2012-01-25,oba,"Now, a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy.",7
2012-01-25,oba,But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.,6
2012-01-25,oba,"Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile.",5
2012-01-25,oba,People cannot afford losing 40 dollars out of each paycheck this year.,5
2012-01-25,oba,There are plenty of ways to get this done.,6

2012-01-25,oba,Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.,3
2012-01-25,oba,Let’s get it done.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"When it comes to the deficit, we’ve already agreed to more than 2 trillion dollars in cuts and savings.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"But we need to do more, and that means making choices.",3
2012-01-25,oba,"Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly 1 trillion dollars more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.",9
2012-01-25,oba,"Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.",4
2012-01-25,oba,Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans?,5
2012-01-25,oba,Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else -- like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans?,7
2012-01-25,oba,"Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, we can’t do both.",6
2012-01-25,oba,The American people know what the right choice is.,3
2012-01-25,oba,So do I.,1
2012-01-25,oba,"As I told the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.",9
2012-01-25,oba,"But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.",8
2012-01-25,oba,Tax reform should follow the Buffett Rule.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"If you make more than 1 million dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.",4
2012-01-25,oba,And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"In fact, if you’re earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"On the other hand, if you make under 250,000 dollars a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.",5
2012-01-25,oba,You’re the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages.,6
2012-01-25,oba,You’re the ones who need relief.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"Now, you can call this class warfare all you want.",3
2012-01-25,oba,But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes?,6
2012-01-25,oba,Most Americans would call that common sense.,2
2012-01-25,oba,We don’t begrudge financial success in this country.,4
2012-01-25,oba,We admire it.,1
2012-01-25,oba,"When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it’s not because they envy the rich.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"It’s because they understand that when I get a tax break I don’t need and the country can’t afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference -- like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet.",8
2012-01-25,oba,That’s not right.,1
2012-01-25,oba,Americans know that’s not right.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"They know that this generation’s success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility.",7
2012-01-25,oba,That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit.,3
2012-01-25,oba,That’s an America built to last.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"Now, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health care.",8
2012-01-25,oba,"But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now:  Nothing will get done in Washington this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.",5
2012-01-25,oba,Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?,5
2012-01-25,oba,The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control.,6
2012-01-25,oba,It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not.,6
2012-01-25,oba,Who benefited from that fiasco?,3
2012-01-25,oba,I’ve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.,8
2012-01-25,oba,But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad -- and it seems to get worse every year.,7
2012-01-25,oba,Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics.,5
2012-01-25,oba,"So together, let’s take some steps to fix that.",3
2012-01-25,oba,Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress; I will sign it tomorrow.,7
2012-01-25,oba,Let’s limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact.,7
2012-01-25,oba,"Let’s make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can’t lobby Congress, and vice versa -- an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.",7
2012-01-25,oba,Some of what’s broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days.,6
2012-01-25,oba,A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything -- even routine business -- passed through the Senate.,7
2012-01-25,oba,Neither party has been blameless in these tactics.,3
2012-01-25,oba,Now both parties should put an end to it.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.",7
2012-01-25,oba,The executive branch also needs to change.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"Too often, it’s inefficient, outdated and remote.",3
2012-01-25,oba,"That’s why I’ve asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that our government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people.",9
2012-01-25,oba,"Finally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town.",5
2012-01-25,oba,We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common-sense ideas.,10
2012-01-25,oba,I’m a Democrat.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed:  That government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and states.",6
2012-01-25,oba,That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that don’t work.,5
2012-01-25,oba,"That’s why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a government program.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective government.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow.",6
2012-01-25,oba,But I can do a whole lot more with your help.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"Because when we act together, there’s nothing the United States of America can’t achieve.",5
2012-01-25,oba,That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.,5
2012-01-25,oba,Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.,5
2012-01-25,oba,"From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can’t escape the reach of the United States of America.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"From this position of strength, we’ve begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan.",4
2012-01-25,oba,Ten thousand of our troops have come home.,4
2012-01-25,oba,Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer.,5
2012-01-25,oba,"This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana’a to Tripoli.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the world’s longest-serving dictators -- a murderer with American blood on his hands.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"Today, he is gone.",1
2012-01-25,oba,"And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be denied.",6
2012-01-25,oba,How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain.,3
2012-01-25,oba,But we have a huge stake in the outcome.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"And while it’s ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well.",7
2012-01-25,oba,We will stand against violence and intimidation.,3
2012-01-25,oba,"We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings -- men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"And we will safeguard America’s own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests.",8
2012-01-25,oba,Look at Iran.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one.",13
2012-01-25,oba,"The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"Let there be no doubt:  America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.",5
2012-01-25,oba,The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe.,4
2012-01-25,oba,Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever.,4
2012-01-25,oba,Our ties to the Americas are deeper.,4
2012-01-25,oba,Our ironclad commitment -- and I mean ironclad -- to Israel’s security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history.,6
2012-01-25,oba,"We’ve made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"From the coalitions we’ve built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the blows we’ve dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.",6
2012-01-25,oba,That’s not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us.,9
2012-01-25,oba,"That’s not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are higher than they’ve been in years.",9
2012-01-25,oba,"Yes, the world is changing.",2
2012-01-25,oba,"No, we can’t control every event.",2
2012-01-25,oba,"But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs -- and as long as I’m President, I intend to keep it that way.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"That’s why, working with our military leaders, I’ve proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget.",9
2012-01-25,oba,"To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.",7
2012-01-25,oba,"Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"As they come home, we must serve them as well as they’ve served us.",3
2012-01-25,oba,That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned -- which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President.,7
2012-01-25,oba,And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation.,7
2012-01-25,oba,"With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families.",8

2012-01-25,oba,Which brings me back to where I began.,4
2012-01-25,oba,Those of us who’ve been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops.,6
2012-01-25,oba,"When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re black or white; Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails.",5
2012-01-25,oba,"When you’re in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind.",6
2012-01-25,oba,One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden.,5
2012-01-25,oba,On it are each of their names.,4
2012-01-25,oba,Some may be Democrats.,1
2012-01-25,oba,Some may be Republicans.,1
2012-01-25,oba,But that doesn’t matter.,1
2012-01-25,oba,"Just like it didn’t matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman who ran against me for President.",11
2012-01-25,oba,All that mattered that day was the mission.,4
2012-01-25,oba,No one thought about politics.,2
2012-01-25,oba,No one thought about themselves.,2
2012-01-25,oba,One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn’t deserve credit for the mission.,7
2012-01-25,oba,"It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs.",9
2012-01-25,oba,"More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other -- because you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your back.",7
2012-01-25,oba,So it is with America.,2
2012-01-25,oba,"Each time I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes.",5
2012-01-25,oba,No one built this country on their own.,3
2012-01-25,oba,This nation is great because we built it together.,2
2012-01-25,oba,This nation is great because we worked as a team.,4
2012-01-25,oba,This nation is great because we get each other’s backs.,4
2012-01-25,oba,"And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.",4
2012-01-25,oba,"As long as we are joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.",6
2012-01-25,oba,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",5
2012-03-27,oba,Thank you.,1
2012-03-27,oba,"Please, thank you very much.",2
2012-03-27,oba,Thank you very much.,2
2012-03-27,oba,"To President Park, faculty, staff and students, thank you so much for this very warm welcome.",5
2012-03-27,oba,It is a great honor to be here at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.,8
2012-03-27,oba,"I want to thank Dr. Park for, a few moments ago, making me an honorary alumni of the university.",6
2012-03-27,oba,I know that this school has one of the world’s finest foreign language programs -- which means that your English is much better than my Korean.,8
2012-03-27,oba,"All I can say is, kamsa hamnida.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"Now, this is my third visit to the Republic of Korea as President.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"I've now been to Seoul more times than any other capital -- except for Washington, D.C.,  of course.",4
2012-03-27,oba,This reflects the extraordinary bonds between our two countries and our commitment to each other.,7
2012-03-27,oba,"I’m pleased that we’re joined by so many leaders here today, Koreans and Americans, who help keep us free and strong and prosperous every day.",8
2012-03-27,oba,That includes our first Korean-American ambassador to the Republic of Korea -- Ambassador Sung Kim.,5
2012-03-27,oba,"I’ve seen the deep connections between our peoples in my own life -- among friends, colleagues.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"I’ve seen it so many patriotic Korean Americans, including a man born in this city of Seoul, who came to America and has dedicated his life to lifting up the poor and sick of the world.",16
2012-03-27,oba,And last week I was proud to nominate him to lead the World Bank -- Dr. Jim Yong Kim.,4
2012-03-27,oba,"I’ve also seen the bonds in our men and women in uniform, like the American and Korean troops I visited yesterday along the DMZ -- Freedom’s Frontier.",6
2012-03-27,oba,And we salute their service and are very grateful for them.,4
2012-03-27,oba,"We honor all those who have given their lives in our defense, including the 46 brave souls who perished aboard the Cheonan two years ago today.",7
2012-03-27,oba,"And in their memory we reaffirm the enduring promise at the core of our alliance -- we stand together, and the commitment of the United States to the defense and the security of the Republic of Korea will never waver.",9
2012-03-27,oba,"Most of all, I see the strength of our alliance in all of you.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"For decades, this school has produced leaders -- public servants, diplomats, businesspeople -- who’ve helped propel the modern miracle that is Korea-- transforming it from crushing poverty to one of the world’s most dynamic economies; from authoritarianism to a thriving democracy; from a country focused inward to a leader for security and prosperity not only in this region but also around the world -- a truly “Global Korea.”  So to all the students here today, this is the Korea your generation will inherit.",15
2012-03-27,oba,And I believe there's no limits to what our two nations can achieve together.,6
2012-03-27,oba,"For like your parents and grandparents before you, you know that the future is what we make of it.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"And you know that in our digital age, we can connect and innovate across borders like never before -- with your smart phones and Twitter and Me2Day and Kakao Talk.",8
2012-03-27,oba,"It’s no wonder so many people around the world have caught the Korean Wave, Hallyu.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"Or consider this:  In advance of my visit, our embassy invited Koreans to send us your questions using social media.",7
2012-03-27,oba,Some of you may have sent questions.,3
2012-03-27,oba,"And they called it, ""Ask President Obama.""",3
2012-03-27,oba,"Now, one of you -- maybe it was you, maybe it was somebody else -- this is true -- asked this question:  “Have you posted, yourself, a supportive opinion on a website under a disguised name, pretending you are one of the supporters of President Obama?”  I hadn’t thought of this.",10
2012-03-27,oba,But the truth is I have not done this.,2
2012-03-27,oba,Maybe my daughters have.,2
2012-03-27,oba,But I haven’t done that myself.,1
2012-03-27,oba,So our shared future -- and the unprecedented opportunity to meet shared challenges together -- is what brings me to Seoul.,5
2012-03-27,oba,"Over the next two days, under President Lee’s leadership, we’ll move ahead with the urgent work of preventing nuclear terrorism by securing the world’s nuclear materials.",9
2012-03-27,oba,"This is an important part of the broader, comprehensive agenda that I want to talk with you about today -- our vision of a world without nuclear weapons.",7
2012-03-27,oba,"Three years ago, I traveled to Prague and I declared America’s commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and to seeking a world without them.",8
2012-03-27,oba,"I said I knew that this goal would not be reached quickly, perhaps not in my lifetime, but I knew we had to begin, with concrete steps.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"And in your generation, I see the spirit we need in this endeavor -- an optimism that beats in the hearts of so many young people around the world.",10
2012-03-27,oba,"It’s that refusal to accept the world as it is, the imagination to see the world as it ought to be, and the courage to turn that vision into reality.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"So today, with you, I want to take stock of our journey and chart our next steps.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"Here in Seoul, more than 50 nations will mark our progress toward the goal we set at the summit I hosted two years ago in Washington -- securing the world’s vulnerable nuclear materials in four years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.",10
2012-03-27,oba,"And since then, nations -- including the United States -- have boosted security at nuclear facilities.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"South Korea, Japan, Pakistan and others are building new centers to improve nuclear security and training.",4
2012-03-27,oba,Nations like Kazakhstan have moved nuclear materials to more secure locations.,4
2012-03-27,oba,"Mexico, and just yesterday Ukraine, have joined the ranks of nations that have removed all the highly enriched uranium from their territory.",7
2012-03-27,oba,"All told, thousands of pounds of nuclear material have been removed from vulnerable sites around the world.",7
2012-03-27,oba,This was deadly material that is now secure and can now never be used against a city like Seoul.,7
2012-03-27,oba,We’re also using every tool at our disposal to break up black markets and nuclear material.,4
2012-03-27,oba,Countries like Georgia and Moldova have seized highly enriched uranium from smugglers.,4
2012-03-27,oba,"And countries like Jordan are building their own counter-smuggling teams, and we’re tying them together in a global network of intelligence and law enforcement.",7
2012-03-27,oba,Nearly 20 nations have now ratified the treaties and international partnerships that are at the center of our efforts.,7
2012-03-27,oba,"And I should add that with the death of Osama bin Laden and the major blows that we’ve struck against al Qaeda, a terrorist organization that has actively sought nuclear weapons is now on the path to defeat.",8
2012-03-27,oba,"So in short, the international community has made it harder than ever for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons, and that has made us all safer.",4
2012-03-27,oba,We’re building an international architecture that can ensure nuclear safety.,4
2012-03-27,oba,But we’re under no illusions.,3
2012-03-27,oba,"We know that nuclear material, enough for many weapons, is still being stored without adequate protection.",6
2012-03-27,oba,And we know that terrorists and criminal gangs are still trying to get their hands on it -- as well as radioactive material for a dirty bomb.,6
2012-03-27,oba,We know that just the smallest amount of plutonium -- about the size of an apple -- could kill hundreds of thousands and spark a global crisis.,7
2012-03-27,oba,The danger of nuclear terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to global security.,6
2012-03-27,oba,"And that's why here in Seoul, we need to keep at it.",4
2012-03-27,oba,And I believe we will.,2
2012-03-27,oba,We’re expecting dozens of nations to announce over the next several days that they’ve fulfilled the promises they made two years ago.,9
2012-03-27,oba,"And we’re now expecting more commitments -- tangible, concrete action -- to secure nuclear materials and, in some cases, remove them completely.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"This is the serious, sustained global effort that we need, and it's an example of more nations bearing the responsibility and the costs of meeting global challenges.",11
2012-03-27,oba,This is how the international community should work in the 21st century.,4
2012-03-27,oba,And Korea is one of the key leaders in this process.,6
2012-03-27,oba,The United States will continue to do our part -- securing our own material and helping others protect theirs.,5
2012-03-27,oba,"We’re moving forward with Russia to eliminate enough plutonium for about 17,000 nuclear weapons and turn it instead into electricity.",5
2012-03-27,oba,I can announce today a new agreement by the United States and several European partners toward sustaining the supply of medical isotopes that are used to treat cancer and heart disease without the use of highly enriched uranium.,14
2012-03-27,oba,"And we will work with industry and hospitals and research centers in the United States and around the world, to recover thousands of unneeded radiological materials so that they can never do us harm.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"Now, American leadership has been essential to progress in a second area -- taking concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"As a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, this is our obligation, and it’s one that I take very seriously.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"But I believe the United States has a unique responsibility to act -- indeed, we have a moral obligation.",4
2012-03-27,oba,I say this as President of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons.,5
2012-03-27,oba,I say it as a Commander-in-Chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side.,8
2012-03-27,oba,"Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my two young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can’t be instantly wiped out.",10
2012-03-27,oba,"Over the past three years, we’ve made important progress.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"With Russia, we’re now reducing our arsenal under the New START Treaty -- the most comprehensive arms control agreement in nearly 20 years.",7
2012-03-27,oba,"And when we’re done, we will have cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"As President, I changed our nuclear posture to reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy.",5
2012-03-27,oba,I made it clear that the United States will not develop new nuclear warheads.,4
2012-03-27,oba,And we will not pursue new military missions for nuclear weapons.,4
2012-03-27,oba,We’ve narrowed the range of contingencies under which we would ever use or threaten to use nuclear weapons.,8
2012-03-27,oba,"At the same time, I’ve made it clear that so long as nuclear weapons exist, we’ll work with our Congress to maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal that guarantees the defense not only of the United States but also our allies -- including South Korea and Japan.",10
2012-03-27,oba,"My administration’s nuclear posture recognizes that the massive nuclear arsenal we inherited from the Cold War is poorly suited to today’s threats, including nuclear terrorism.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"So last summer, I directed my national security team to conduct a comprehensive study of our nuclear forces.",5
2012-03-27,oba,That study is still underway.,2
2012-03-27,oba,"But even as we have more work to do, we can already say with confidence that we have more nuclear weapons than we need.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"Even after New START, the United States will still have more than 1,500 deployed nuclear weapons, and some 5,000 warheads.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"I firmly believe that we can ensure the security of the United States and our allies, maintain a strong deterrent against any threat, and still pursue further reductions in our nuclear arsenal.",7
2012-03-27,oba,"Going forward, we’ll continue to seek discussions with Russia on a step we have never taken before -- reducing not only our strategic nuclear warheads, but also tactical weapons and warheads in reserve.",6
2012-03-27,oba,I look forward to discussing this agenda with President Putin when we will meet in May.,6
2012-03-27,oba,"Missile defense will be on the agenda, but I believe this should be an area of cooperation, not tension.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"And I’m confident that, working together, we can continue to make progress and reduce our nuclear stockpiles.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"Of course, we’ll consult closely with our allies every step of the way, because the security and defense of our allies, both in Europe and Asia, is not negotiable.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"Here in Asia, we've urged China -- with its growing nuclear arsenal -- to join us in a dialogue on nuclear issues.",6
2012-03-27,oba,That offer remains open.,2
2012-03-27,oba,"And more broadly, my administration will continue to pursue ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"And after years of delay, it’s time to find a path forward on a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons -- ends it once and for all.",12
2012-03-27,oba,"By working to meet our responsibilities as a nuclear power, we’ve made progress in a third area -- strengthening the global regime that prevents the spread of nuclear weapons.",7
2012-03-27,oba,"When I came into office, the cornerstone of the world’s effort -- which is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -- was fraying.",5
2012-03-27,oba,Iran had started spinning thousands of centrifuges.,4
2012-03-27,oba,North Korea conducted another nuclear test.,2
2012-03-27,oba,And the international community was largely divided on how to respond.,3
2012-03-27,oba,"Over the past three years, we have begun to reverse that dynamic.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"Working with others, we’ve enhanced the global partnership that prevent proliferation.",3
2012-03-27,oba,The International Atomic Energy Agency is now conducting the strongest inspections ever.,3
2012-03-27,oba,"And we’ve upheld the basic bargain of the NPT:  Countries with nuclear weapons, like the United States and Russia, will move towards disarmament; countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them; and all countries can have access to peaceful nuclear energy.",7
2012-03-27,oba,"Because of these efforts, the international community is more united and nations that attempt to flout their obligations are more isolated.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"Of course, that includes North Korea.",2
2012-03-27,oba,"Here in Korea, I want to speak directly to the leaders in Pyongyang.",5
2012-03-27,oba,The United States has no hostile intent toward your country.,4
2012-03-27,oba,We are committed to peace.,3
2012-03-27,oba,"And we are prepared to take steps to improve relations, which is why we have offered nutritional aid to North Korean mothers and children.",10
2012-03-27,oba,"But by now it should be clear, your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek; they have undermined it.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"Instead of the dignity you desire, you're more isolated.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"Instead of earning the respect of the world, you've been met with strong sanctions and condemnation.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"You can continue down the road you are on, but we know where that leads.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"It leads to more of the same -- more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.",10
2012-03-27,oba,And know this:  There will be no rewards for provocations.,5
2012-03-27,oba,Those days are over.,2
2012-03-27,oba,"To the leaders of Pyongyang I say, this is the choice before you.",4
2012-03-27,oba,This is the decision that you must make.,3
2012-03-27,oba,"Today we say, Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace and give a better life to the people of North Korea.",8
2012-03-27,oba,This same principle applies with respect to Iran.,4
2012-03-27,oba,"Under the NPT, Iran has the right to peaceful nuclear energy.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"In fact, time and again the international community -- including the United States -- has offered to help Iran develop nuclear energy peacefully.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"But time and again Iran has refused, instead taking the path of denial, deceit and deception.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"And that is why Iran also stands alone, as the only member of the NPT unable to convince the international community that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes -- the only member.",8
2012-03-27,oba,"That’s why the world has imposed unprecedented sanctions, slowing Iran’s nuclear program.",5
2012-03-27,oba,The international community is now poised to enter talks with Iran’s leaders.,6
2012-03-27,oba,"Once again, there is the possibility of a diplomatic resolution that gives Iran access to peaceful nuclear energy while addressing the concerns of the international community.",9
2012-03-27,oba,"Today, I’ll meet with the leaders of Russia and China as we work to achieve a resolution in which Iran fulfills its obligations.",6
2012-03-27,oba,There is time to solve this diplomatically.,3
2012-03-27,oba,It is always my preference to solve these issues diplomatically.,3
2012-03-27,oba,But time is short.,1
2012-03-27,oba,"Iran’s leaders must understand they, too, face a choice.",4
2012-03-27,oba,Iran must act with the seriousness and sense of urgency  that this moment demands.,4
2012-03-27,oba,Iran must meet its obligations.,2
2012-03-27,oba,"For the global response to Iran and North Korea’s intransigence, a new international norm is emerging:  Treaties are binding; rules will be enforced; and violations will have consequences.",7
2012-03-27,oba,We refuse to consign ourselves to a future where more and more regimes possess the world’s most deadly weapons.,7
2012-03-27,oba,"And this brings me to the final area where we’ve made progress -- a renewed commitment to harnessing the power of the atom not for war, but for peaceful purposes.",10
2012-03-27,oba,"After the tragedy at Fukushima, it was right and appropriate that nations moved to improve the safety and security of nuclear facilities.",6
2012-03-27,oba,We’re doing so in the United States.,3
2012-03-27,oba,It’s taking place all across the world.,3
2012-03-27,oba,"As we do, let’s never forget the astonishing benefits that nuclear technology has brought to our lives.",6
2012-03-27,oba,Nuclear technology helps make our food safe.,4
2012-03-27,oba,It prevents disease in the developing world.,3
2012-03-27,oba,It’s the high-tech medicine that treats cancer and finds new cures.,5
2012-03-27,oba,"And, of course, it’s the energy -- the clean energy that helps cut the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"Here in South Korea, as you know, as a leader in nuclear energy, you’ve shown the progress and prosperity that can be achieved when nations embrace peaceful nuclear energy and reject the development of nuclear arms.",8
2012-03-27,oba,"And with rising oil prices and a warming climate, nuclear energy will only become more important.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"That’s why, in the United States, we’ve restarted our nuclear industry as part of a comprehensive strategy to develop every energy source.",8
2012-03-27,oba,We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades.,3
2012-03-27,oba,"We’re investing in innovative technologies so we can build the next generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants.",6
2012-03-27,oba,And we’re training the next generation of scientists and engineers who are going to unlock new technologies to carry us forward.,8
2012-03-27,oba,One of the great challenges they’ll face and that your generation will face is the fuel cycle itself in producing nuclear energy.,5
2012-03-27,oba,We all know the problem:  The very process that gives us nuclear energy can also put nations and terrorists within the reach of nuclear weapons.,7
2012-03-27,oba,"We simply can’t go on accumulating huge amounts of the very material, like separated plutonium, that we’re trying to keep away from terrorists.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"And that’s why we’re creating new fuel banks, to help countries realize the energy they seek without increasing the nuclear dangers that we fear.",10
2012-03-27,oba,That’s why I’ve called for a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation.,6
2012-03-27,oba,We need an international commitment to unlocking the fuel cycle of the future.,7
2012-03-27,oba,In the United States we’re investing in the research and development of new fuel cycles so that dangerous materials can’t be stolen or diverted.,5
2012-03-27,oba,And today I urge nations to join us in seeking a future where we harness the awesome power of the atom to build and not to destroy.,11
2012-03-27,oba,"In this sense, we see how the efforts I’ve described today reinforce each other.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"When we enhance nuclear security, we’re in a stronger position to harness safe, clean nuclear energy.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"When we develop new, safer approaches to nuclear energy, we reduce the risk of nuclear terrorism and proliferation.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"When nations, including my own, fulfill our responsibilities, it strengthens our ability to ensure that other nations fulfill their responsibilities.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"And step by step, we come closer to the security and peace of a world without nuclear weapons.",6
2012-03-27,oba,I know that there are those who deride our vision.,5
2012-03-27,oba,There are those who say ours is an impossible goal that will be forever out of reach.,6
2012-03-27,oba,"But to anyone who doubts the great progress that is possible, I tell them, come to Korea.",6
2012-03-27,oba,"Come to this country, which rose from the ashes of war -- a country that rose from the ashes of war, turning rubble into gleaming cities.",11
2012-03-27,oba,"Stand where I stood yesterday, along a border that is the world’s clearest contrast between a country committed to progress, a country committed to its people, and a country that leaves its own citizens to starve.",10
2012-03-27,oba,"Come to this great university, where a new generation is taking its place in the world -- helping to create opportunities that your parents and grandparents could only imagine.",9
2012-03-27,oba,"Come and see some of the courageous individuals who join us today -- men and women, young and old, born in the North, but who left all they knew behind and risked their lives to find freedom and opportunity here in the South.",7
2012-03-27,oba,In your life stories we see the truth -- Koreans are one people.,4
2012-03-27,oba,"And if just given the chance, if given their freedom, Koreans in the North are capable of great progress as well.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"Looking out across the DMZ yesterday, but also looking into your eyes today, I’m reminded of another country’s experience that speaks to the change that is possible in our world.",9
2012-03-27,oba,"After a terrible war, a proud people was divided.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"Across a fortified border, armies massed, ready for war.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"For decades, it was hard to imagine a different future.",3
2012-03-27,oba,But the forces of history and hopes of man could not be denied.,6
2012-03-27,oba,"And today, the people of Germany are whole again -- united and free.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"No two places follow the same path, but this much is true:  The currents of history cannot be held back forever.",5
2012-03-27,oba,The deep longing for freedom and dignity will not go away.,4
2012-03-27,oba,"So, too, on this divided peninsula.",4
2012-03-27,oba,The day all Koreans yearn for will not come easily or without great sacrifice.,4
2012-03-27,oba,"But make no mistake, it will come.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"And when it does, change will unfold that once seemed impossible.",2
2012-03-27,oba,"And checkpoints will open and watchtowers will stand empty, and families long separated will finally be reunited.",4
2012-03-27,oba,"And the Korean people, at long last, will be whole and free.",3
2012-03-27,oba,"Like our vision of a world without nuclear weapons, our vision of a Korea that stands as one may not be reached quickly.",5
2012-03-27,oba,"But from this day until then, and all the days that follow, we take comfort in knowing that the security we seek, the peace we want, is closer at hand because of the great alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea; and because we stand for the dignity and freedom of all Koreans.",10
2012-03-27,oba,"And no matter the test, no matter the trial, we stand together.",3
2012-03-27,oba,We work together.,1
2012-03-27,oba,We go together.,1
2012-03-27,oba,Katchi kapshida!,1

2012-03-31,oba,"Today, members of Congress have a simple choice to make:  They can stand with the big oil companies, or they can stand with the American people.",4
2012-03-31,oba,"Right now, the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits –- profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station.",7
2012-03-31,oba,"But on top of these record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year -- billions a year in taxpayer subsidies -- a subsidy that they’ve enjoyed year after year for the last century.",6
2012-03-31,oba,Think about that.,2
2012-03-31,oba,It’s like hitting the American people twice.,4
2012-03-31,oba,You’re already paying a premium at the pump right now.,3
2012-03-31,oba,"And on top of that, Congress, up until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry.",6
2012-03-31,oba,It’s not as if these companies can’t stand on their own.,4
2012-03-31,oba,"Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits.",3
2012-03-31,oba,Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.,2
2012-03-31,oba,"And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companies’ profits.",4
2012-03-31,oba,"In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits.",5
2012-03-31,oba,"Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because we’re giving them billions in tax giveaways every year.",6
2012-03-31,oba,"Now, I want to make clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy.",6
2012-03-31,oba,We want U.S. oil companies to be doing well.,3
2012-03-31,oba,We want them to succeed.,2
2012-03-31,oba,"That’s why under my administration, we’ve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil and gas production.",7
2012-03-31,oba,We’ve quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high.,4
2012-03-31,oba,We’ve added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some.,3
2012-03-31,oba,"And just yesterday, we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic.",6
2012-03-31,oba,"So the fact is, we’re producing more oil right now than we have in eight years, and we’re importing less of it as well.",5
2012-03-31,oba,"For two years in a row, America has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home -- for the first time in over a decade.",6
2012-03-31,oba,So American oil is booming.,2
2012-03-31,oba,The oil industry is doing just fine.,2
2012-03-31,oba,"With record profits and rising production, I’m not worried about the big oil companies.",4
2012-03-31,oba,"With high oil prices around the world, they’ve got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil.",5
2012-03-31,oba,That’s why I think it’s time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank.,14
2012-03-31,oba,"And I think it’s curious that some folks in Congress, who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies.",11
2012-03-31,oba,"Instead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry that’s never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double-down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising -- investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments in fuel-efficient cars and trucks, and energy-efficient homes and buildings.",9
2012-03-31,oba,That’s the future.,2
2012-03-31,oba,That’s the only way we're going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year.,12
2012-03-31,oba,"As the economy is growing, the only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly.",5
2012-03-31,oba,That’s not the kind of pattern that we want to be in.,4
2012-03-31,oba,"We want the economy doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs.",5
2012-03-31,oba,"And keep in mind, we can’t just drill our way out of this problem.",4
2012-03-31,oba,"As I said, oil production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's been doing well even as gas prices are going up.",5
2012-03-31,oba,"Well, the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the world’s oil but we only have 2 percent of the world’s known oil reserves.",7
2012-03-31,oba,And that means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow but we’d still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference.,5
2012-03-31,oba,We’d still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs.,4
2012-03-31,oba,"And because it’s a world market, the fact that we’re doing more here in the United States doesn’t necessarily help us because even U.S. oil companies they’re selling that oil on a worldwide market.",6
2012-03-31,oba,They’re not keeping it just for us.,2
2012-03-31,oba,And that means that if there’s rising demand around the world then the prices are going to up.,6
2012-03-31,oba,That’s not the future that I want for America.,4
2012-03-31,oba,I don’t want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that there’s some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators get nervous about whether there’s going to be enough supply.,10
2012-03-31,oba,I don’t want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world.,8
2012-03-31,oba,I want us to control our own destiny.,3
2012-03-31,oba,I want us to forge our own future.,3
2012-03-31,oba,"And that’s why, as long as I’m President, America is going to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way.",10
2012-03-31,oba,"But it also means that we’re going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across America.",8
2012-03-31,oba,We’re going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power that’s already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs.,11
2012-03-31,oba,We’re going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks instead of every week.,6
2012-03-31,oba,We’re going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that you’re in charge of your own energy bills.,10
2012-03-31,oba,We’re going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource:  American ingenuity and American imagination.,7
2012-03-31,oba,That’s what we need to keep going.,3
2012-03-31,oba,That’s what’s at stake right now.,3
2012-03-31,oba,That’s the choice that we face.,3
2012-03-31,oba,And that’s the choice that’s facing Congress today.,3
2012-03-31,oba,"They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that aren’t needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future.",9
2012-03-31,oba,It’s that simple.,2
2012-03-31,oba,"And as long as I’m President, I’m betting on the future.",3
2012-03-31,oba,"And as the people I’ve talked to around the country, including the people who are behind me here today, they put their faith in the future as well.",10
2012-03-31,oba,That’s what we do as Americans.,3
2012-03-31,oba,That’s who we are.,2
2012-03-31,oba,We innovate.,1
2012-03-31,oba,We discover.,1
2012-03-31,oba,We seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges.,5
2012-03-31,oba,"And, ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed.",3
2012-03-31,oba,And I believe that we’re going to do that again.,3
2012-03-31,oba,"Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith.",5
2012-03-31,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2012-04-29,oba,Thank you.,1
2012-04-29,oba,"Good evening, everybody.",1
2012-04-29,oba,Good evening.,1
2012-04-29,oba,I could not be more thrilled to be here tonight -- at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.,5
2012-04-29,oba,This is great crowd.,2
2012-04-29,oba,They’re already laughing.,1
2012-04-29,oba,It’s terrific.,1
2012-04-29,oba,"Chuck Todd -- love you, brother.",2
2012-04-29,oba,I’m delighted to see some of the cast members of Glee are here.,8
2012-04-29,oba,"And Jimmy Kimmel, it’s an honor, man.",2
2012-04-29,oba,What’s so funny?,2
2012-04-29,oba,"My fellow Americans, we gather during a historic anniversary.",3
2012-04-29,oba,"Last year at this time -- in fact, on this very weekend -- we finally delivered justice to one of the world’s most notorious individuals.",6
2012-04-29,oba,"Now, this year, we gather in the midst of a heated election season.",5
2012-04-29,oba,And Axelrod tells me I should never miss a chance to reintroduce myself to the American people.,6
2012-04-29,oba,"So tonight, this is how I’d like to begin:  My name is Barack Obama.",3
2012-04-29,oba,My mother was born in Kansas.,2
2012-04-29,oba,My father was born in Kenya.,2
2012-04-29,oba,"And I was born, of course, in Hawaii.",2
2012-04-29,oba,"In 2009, I took office in the face of some enormous challenges.",5
2012-04-29,oba,"Now, some have said I blame too many problems on my predecessor, but let’s not forget that’s a practice that was initiated by George W. Bush.",9
2012-04-29,oba,"Since then, Congress and I have certainly had our differences; yet, I’ve tried to be civil, to not take any cheap shots.",3
2012-04-29,oba,And that’s why I want to especially thank all the members who took a break from their exhausting schedule of not passing any laws to be here tonight.,11
2012-04-29,oba,Let’s give them a big round of applause.,4
2012-04-29,oba,"Despite many obstacles, much has changed during my time in office.",4
2012-04-29,oba,"Four years ago, I was locked in a brutal primary battle with Hillary Clinton.",5
2012-04-29,oba,"Four years later, she won’t stop drunk-texting me from Cartagena.",3
2012-04-29,oba,"Four years ago, I was a Washington outsider.",3
2012-04-29,oba,"Four years later, I’m at this dinner.",3
2012-04-29,oba,"Four years ago, I looked like this.",3
2012-04-29,oba,"Today, I look like this.",2
2012-04-29,oba,"And four years from now, I will look like this.",3
2012-04-29,oba,That’s not even funny.,2
2012-04-29,oba,"Anyway, it’s great to be here this evening in the vast, magnificent Hilton ballroom -- or what Mitt Romney would call a little fixer-upper.",4
2012-04-29,oba,"I mean, look at this party.",3
2012-04-29,oba,"We’ve got men in tuxes, women in gowns, fine wine, first-class entertainment.",6
2012-04-29,oba,I was just relieved to learn this was not a GSA conference.,4
2012-04-29,oba,Unbelievable.,1
2012-04-29,oba,Not even the mind reader knew what they were thinking.,2
2012-04-29,oba,"Of course, the White House Correspondents’ Dinner is known as the prom of Washington D.C. -- a term coined by political reporters who clearly never had the chance to go to an actual prom.",10
2012-04-29,oba,Our chaperone for the evening is Jimmy Kimmel -- who is perfect for the job since most of tonight’s audience is in his key demographic -- people who fall asleep during Nightline.,9
2012-04-29,oba,Jimmy got his start years ago on The Man Show.,3
2012-04-29,oba,"In Washington, that’s what we call a congressional hearing on contraception.",4
2012-04-29,oba,And plenty of journalists are here tonight.,3
2012-04-29,oba,I'd be remiss if I didn’t congratulate the Huffington Post on their Pulitzer Prize.,5
2012-04-29,oba,"You deserve it, Arianna.",1
2012-04-29,oba,There's no one else out there linking to the kinds of hard-hitting journalism that HuffPo is linking to every single day.,8
2012-04-29,oba,Give them a round of applause.,3
2012-04-29,oba,And you don’t pay them -- it's a great business model.,2
2012-04-29,oba,"Even Sarah Palin is getting back into the game, guest hosting on The Today Show -- which reminds me of an old saying:  What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull?",8
2012-04-29,oba,A pit bull is delicious.,2
2012-04-29,oba,A little soy sauce.,1
2012-04-29,oba,"Now, I know at this point many of you are expecting me to go after my likely opponent, Newt Gingrich.",5
2012-04-29,oba,"Newt, there's still time, man.",2
2012-04-29,oba,But I'm not going to do that -- I'm not going to attack any of the Republican candidates.,5
2012-04-29,oba,Take Mitt Romney -- he and I actually have a lot in common.,3
2012-04-29,oba,"We both think of our wives as our better halves, and polls show, to a alarmingly insulting extent, the American people agree.",5
2012-04-29,oba,"We also both have degrees from Harvard; I have one, he has two.",5
2012-04-29,oba,What a snob.,1
2012-04-29,oba,"Of course, we've also had our differences.",2
2012-04-29,oba,"Recently, his campaign criticized me for slow jamming the news with Jimmy Fallon.",5
2012-04-29,oba,"In fact, I understand Governor Romney was so incensed he asked his staff if he could get some equal time on The Merv Griffin Show.",7
2012-04-29,oba,"Still, I guess Governor Romney is feeling pretty good about things because he took a few hours off the other day to see The Hunger Games -- some of you have seen it.",6
2012-04-29,oba,It's a movie about people who court wealthy sponsors and then brutally savage each other until only one contestant is left standing.,9
2012-04-29,oba,I'm sure this was a really good change of pace for him.,5
2012-04-29,oba,I have not seen The Hunger Games; not enough class warfare for me.,4
2012-04-29,oba,"Of course, I know everybody is predicting a nasty election, and thankfully, we've all agreed that families are off limits.",4
2012-04-29,oba,"Dogs, however, are apparently fair game.",2
2012-04-29,oba,"And while both campaigns have had some fun with this, the other day I saw a new ad from one of these outside groups that, frankly, I think crossed the line.",5
2012-04-29,oba,"I know Governor Romney says he has no control over what his super PACs do, but can we show the ad real quick?",6
2012-04-29,oba,"That’s pretty rough -- but I can take it, because my stepfather always told me, it's a boy-eat-dog world out there.",6
2012-04-29,oba,"Now, if I do win a second term as President, let me just say something to all the -- let me just say something to all my conspiracy-oriented friends on the right who think I'm planning to unleash some secret agenda:  You're absolutely right.",14
2012-04-29,oba,So allow me to close with a quick preview of the secret agenda you can expect in a second Obama administration.,9
2012-04-29,oba,"In my first term, I sang Al Green; in my second term, I'm going with Young Jeezy.",4
2012-04-29,oba,"Michelle said, yeah.",1
2012-04-29,oba,I sing that to her sometimes.,2
2012-04-29,oba,"In my first term, we ended the war in Iraq; in my second term, I will win the war on Christmas.",4
2012-04-29,oba,"In my first term, we repealed the policy known as ""don't ask, don't tell"" -- wait, though; in my second term, we will replace it with a policy known as, it's raining men.",6
2012-04-29,oba,"In my first term, we passed health care reform; in my second term, I guess I'll pass it again.",4
2012-04-29,oba,"I do want to end tonight on a slightly more serious note -- whoever takes the oath of office next January will face some great challenges, but he will also inherit traditions that make us greater than the challenges we face.",9
2012-04-29,oba,"And one of those traditions is represented here tonight: a free press that isn't afraid to ask questions, to examine and to criticize.",8
2012-04-29,oba,"And in service of that mission, all of you make sacrifices.",5
2012-04-29,oba,"Tonight, we remember journalists such as Anthony Shadid and Marie Colvin -- who made the ultimate sacrifice as they sought to shine a light on some of the most important stories of our time.",11
2012-04-29,oba,"So whether you are a blogger or a broadcaster, whether you take on powerful interests here at home or put yourself in harm's way overseas, I have the greatest respect and admiration for what you do.",7
2012-04-29,oba,I know sometimes you like to give me a hard time -- and I certainly like to return the favor -- but I never forget that our country depends on you.,4
2012-04-29,oba,"You help protect our freedom, our democracy, and our way of life.",6
2012-04-29,oba,"And just to set the record straight, I really do enjoy attending these dinners.",3
2012-04-29,oba,"In fact, I had a lot more material prepared, but I have to get the Secret Service home in time for their new curfew.",5
2012-04-29,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2012-04-29,oba,Thank you.,1
2012-05-02,oba,"

Good evening from Bagram Air Base.",3
2012-05-02,oba,"This outpost is more than 7,000 miles from home, but for over a decade, it's been close to our hearts.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"Because here in Afghanistan, more than half a million of our sons and daughters have sacrificed to protect our country.",4
2012-05-02,oba,"Today I signed a historic agreement between the United States and Afghanistan that defines a new kind of relationship between our countries, a future in which Afghans are responsible for the security of their nation and we build an equal partnership between two sovereign states, a future in which war ends and a new chapter begins.",18
2012-05-02,oba,Tonight I'd like to speak to you about this transition.,4
2012-05-02,oba,"But first, let us remember why we came here.",3
2012-05-02,oba,"It was here, in Afghanistan, where Usama bin Laden established a safe haven for his terrorist organization.",7
2012-05-02,oba,"It was here, in Afghanistan, where Al Qaida brought new recruits, trained them, and plotted acts of terror.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"It was here, from within these borders, that Al Qaida launched the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, and children.",6
2012-05-02,oba,"And so, 10 years ago, the United States and our allies went to war to make sure that Al Qaida could never again use this country to launch attacks against us.",7
2012-05-02,oba,"Despite initial success, for a number of reasons, this war has taken longer than most anticipated.",4
2012-05-02,oba,"In 2002, bin Laden and his lieutenants escaped across the border and established safe haven in Pakistan.",3
2012-05-02,oba,America spent nearly 8 years fighting a different war in Iraq.,4
2012-05-02,oba,And Al Qaida's extremist allies within the Taliban have waged a brutal insurgency.,4
2012-05-02,oba,"But over the last 3 years, the tide has turned.",3
2012-05-02,oba,We broke the Taliban's momentum.,3
2012-05-02,oba,We built strong Afghan security forces.,2
2012-05-02,oba,"We devastated Al Qaida's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"And 1 year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Usama bin Laden.",5
2012-05-02,oba,The goal that I set to defeat Al Qaida and deny it a chance to rebuild is now within our reach.,8
2012-05-02,oba,"Still, there will be difficult days ahead.",3
2012-05-02,oba,The enormous sacrifices of our men and women are not over.,4
2012-05-02,oba,But tonight I'd like to tell you how we will complete our mission and end the war in Afghanistan.,5
2012-05-02,oba,"First, we've begun a transition to Afghan responsibility for security.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"Already, nearly half of the Afghan people live in places where Afghan security forces are moving into the lead.",6
2012-05-02,oba,"This month, at a NATO summit in Chicago, our coalition will set a goal for Afghan forces to be in the lead for combat operations across the country next year.",9
2012-05-02,oba,"International troops will continue to train, advise, and assist the Afghans, and fight alongside them when needed.",6
2012-05-02,oba,But we will shift into a support role as Afghans step forward.,3
2012-05-02,oba,"As we do, our troops will be coming home.",2
2012-05-02,oba,"Last year, we removed 10,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan.",2
2012-05-02,oba,"Another 23,000 will leave by the end of the summer.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"After that, reductions will continue at a steady pace, with more and more of our troops coming home.",6
2012-05-02,oba,"And as our coalition agreed, by the end of 2014, the Afghans will be fully responsible for the security of their country.",6
2012-05-02,oba,"Second, we are training Afghan security forces to get the job done.",4
2012-05-02,oba,"Those forces have surged and will peak at 352,000 this year.",3
2012-05-02,oba,The Afghans will sustain that level for 3 years and then reduce the size of their military.,5
2012-05-02,oba,"And in Chicago, we will endorse a proposal to support a strong and sustainable long-term Afghan force.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"Third, we're building an enduring partnership.",2
2012-05-02,oba,"The agreement we signed today sends a clear message to the Afghan people: As you stand up, you will not stand alone.",4
2012-05-02,oba,"It establishes the basis for our cooperation over the next decade, including shared commitments to combat terrorism and strengthen democratic institutions.",7
2012-05-02,oba,It supports Afghan efforts to advance development and dignity for their people.,5
2012-05-02,oba,"And it includes Afghan commitments to transparency and accountability and to protect the human rights of all Afghans: men and women, boys and girls.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"Within this framework, we'll work with the Afghans to determine what support they need to accomplish two narrow security missions beyond 2014: counterterrorism and continued training.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"But we will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains.",4
2012-05-02,oba,That will be the job of the Afghan people.,4
2012-05-02,oba,"Fourth, we're pursuing a negotiated peace.",2
2012-05-02,oba,"In coordination with the Afghan Government, my administration has been in direct discussions with the Taliban.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"We've made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with Al Qaida, renounce violence, and abide by Afghan laws.",8
2012-05-02,oba,Many members of the Taliban--from foot soldiers to leaders--have indicated an interest in reconciliation.,4
2012-05-02,oba,The path to peace is now set before them.,3
2012-05-02,oba,"Those who refuse to walk it will face strong Afghan security forces, backed by the United States and our allies.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"Fifth, we are building a global consensus to support peace and stability in South Asia.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"In Chicago, the international community will express support for this plan and for Afghanistan's future.",4
2012-05-02,oba,"And I have made it clear to its neighbor Pakistan that it can and should be an equal partner in this process in a way that respects Pakistan's sovereignty, interests, and democratic institutions.",9
2012-05-02,oba,"In pursuit of a durable peace, America has no designs beyond an end to Al Qaida safe havens and respect for Afghan sovereignty.",7
2012-05-02,oba,"As we move forward, some people will ask why we need a firm timeline.",3
2012-05-02,oba,The answer is clear: Our goal is not to build a country in America's image or to eradicate every vestige of the Taliban.,6
2012-05-02,oba,"These objectives would require many more years, many more dollars, and most importantly, many more American lives.",6
2012-05-02,oba,"Our goal is to destroy Al Qaida, and we are on a path to do exactly that.",6
2012-05-02,oba,Afghans want to assert their sovereignty and build a lasting peace.,4
2012-05-02,oba,That requires a clear timeline to wind down the war.,4
2012-05-02,oba,"Others will ask, why don't we leave immediately?",2
2012-05-02,oba,That answer is also clear: We must give Afghanistan the opportunity to stabilize.,3
2012-05-02,oba,"Otherwise, our gains could be lost, and Al Qaida could establish itself once more.",3
2012-05-02,oba,"And as Commander in Chief, I refuse to let that happen.",4
2012-05-02,oba,I recognize that many Americans are tired of war.,4
2012-05-02,oba,"As President, nothing is more wrenching than signing a letter to a family of the fallen or looking into the eyes of a child who will grow up without a mother or father.",12
2012-05-02,oba,I will not keep Americans in harm's way a single day longer than is absolutely required for our national security.,5
2012-05-02,oba,But we must finish the job we started in Afghanistan and end this war responsibly.,4
2012-05-02,oba,"My fellow Americans, we've traveled through more than a decade under the dark cloud of war.",4
2012-05-02,oba,"Yet, here in the predawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon.",6
2012-05-02,oba,The Iraq war is over.,2
2012-05-02,oba,"The number of our troops in harm's way has been cut in half, and more will soon be coming home.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"We have a clear path to fulfill our mission in Afghanistan, while delivering justice to Al Qaida.",5
2012-05-02,oba,This future is only within reach because of our men and women in uniform.,4
2012-05-02,oba,"Time and again, they have answered the call to serve in distant and dangerous places.",6
2012-05-02,oba,"In an age when so many institutions have come up short, these Americans stood tall.",4
2012-05-02,oba,They met their responsibilities to one another and to the flag they serve under.,5
2012-05-02,oba,"I just met with some of them and told them that as Commander in Chief, I could not be prouder.",6
2012-05-02,oba,"And in their faces, we see what is best in ourselves and our country.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"Our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, marines, coastguardsmen, and civilians in Afghanistan have done their duty.",8
2012-05-02,oba,Now we must summon that same sense of common purpose.,4
2012-05-02,oba,We must give our veterans and military families the support they deserve and the opportunities they have earned.,4
2012-05-02,oba,And we must redouble our efforts to build a nation worthy of their sacrifice.,7
2012-05-02,oba,"As we emerge from a decade of conflict abroad and economic crisis at home, it's time to renew America.",6
2012-05-02,oba,"An America where our children live free from fear and have the skills to claim their dreams, a united America of grit and resilience, where sunlight glistens off soaring new towers in downtown Manhattan and we build our future as one people, as one Nation.",10
2012-05-02,oba,"Here in Afghanistan, Americans answered the call to defend their fellow citizens and uphold human dignity.",5
2012-05-02,oba,"Today we recall the fallen and those who suffered wounds, both seen and unseen.",4
2012-05-02,oba,"But through dark days, we have drawn strength from their example and the ideals that have guided our Nation and led the world: a belief that all people are treated equal and deserve the freedom to determine their destiny.",8
2012-05-02,oba,That is the light that guides us still.,3
2012-05-02,oba,"This time of war began in Afghanistan, and this is where it will end.",3
2012-05-02,oba,"With faith in each other and our eyes fixed on the future, let us finish the work at hand and forge a just and lasting peace.",7
2012-05-02,oba,"May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America.",4
2012-05-10,oba,"Well—you know, I have to tell you, as I've said, I've—I've been going through an evolution on this issue.",7
2012-05-10,oba,I've always been adamant that—gay and lesbian—Americans should be treated fairly and equally.,4
2012-05-10,oba,"And that's why in addition to everything we've done in this administration, rolling back Don't Ask, Don't Tell—so that—you know, outstanding Americans can serve our country.",9
2012-05-10,oba,"Whether it's no longer defending the Defense Against Marriage Act, which—tried to federalize—what is historically been state law.",4
2012-05-10,oba,I've stood on the side of broader equality for—the L.G.B.T.,7
2012-05-10,oba,community.,1
2012-05-10,oba,"And I had hesitated on gay marriage—in part, because I thought civil unions would be sufficient.",4
2012-05-10,oba,That that was something that would give people hospital visitation rights and—other—elements that we take for granted.,6
2012-05-10,oba,"And—I was sensitive to the fact that—for a lot of people, you know, the word marriage was something that evokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs, and so forth.",10
2012-05-10,oba,"But I have to tell you that over the course of—several years, as I talk to friends and family and neighbors.",7
2012-05-10,oba,"When I think about—members of my own staff who are incredibly committed, in monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together.",5
2012-05-10,oba,"When I think about—those soldiers or airmen or marines or—sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf—and yet, feel constrained, even now that Don't Ask, Don't Tell is gone, because—they're not able to—commit themselves in a marriage.",9
2012-05-10,oba,"At a certain point, I've just concluded that—for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that—I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.",8
2012-05-10,oba,Now—I have to tell you that part of my hesitation on this has also been I didn't want to nationalize the issue.,7
2012-05-10,oba,There's a tendency when I weigh in to think suddenly it becomes political and it becomes polarized.,5
2012-05-10,oba,"And what you're seeing is, I think, states working through this issue—in fits and starts, all across the country.",5
2012-05-10,oba,"Different communities are arriving at different conclusions, at different times.",3
2012-05-10,oba,And I think that's a healthy process and a healthy debate.,4
2012-05-10,oba,"And I continue to believe that this is an issue that is gonna be worked out at the local level, because historically, this has not been a federal issue, what's recognized as a marriage.",8
2012-05-10,oba,what I'm saying is is that different states are coming to different conclusions.,4
2012-05-10,oba,But this debate is taking place—at a local level.,3
2012-05-10,oba,And I think the whole country is evolving and changing.,3
2012-05-10,oba,"And—you know, one of the things that I'd like to see is—that a conversation continue in a respectful way.",6
2012-05-10,oba,I think it's important to recognize that—folks—who—feel very strongly that marriage should be defined narrowly as—between a man and a woman—many of them are not coming at it from a mean-spirited perspective.,11
2012-05-10,oba,They're coming at it because they care about families.,3
2012-05-10,oba,"And—they—they have a different understanding, in terms of—you know, what the word ""marriage"" should mean.",6
2012-05-10,oba,"And I—a bunch of 'em are friends of mine—you know, pastors and—you know, people who—I deeply respect.",5
2012-05-10,oba,Absolutely.,1
2012-05-10,oba,"But—but I think it's important for me—to say to them that as much as I respect 'em, as much as I understand where they're comin' from—when I meet gay and lesbian couples, when I meet same-sex couples, and I see—how caring they are, how much love they have in their hearts—how they're takin' care of their kids.",11
2012-05-10,oba,"When I hear from them the pain they feel that somehow they are still considered—less than full citizens when it comes to—their legal rights—then—for me, I think it—it just has tipped the scales in that direction.",6
2012-05-10,oba,"And—you know, one of the things that you see in—a state like New York that—ended up—legalizing same-sex marriages—was I thought they did a good job in engaging the religious community.",10
2012-05-10,oba,Making it absolutely clear that what we're talking about are civil marriages and civil laws.,5
2012-05-10,oba,"That they're respectful of religious liberty, that—you know, churches and other faith institutions—are still gonna be able to make determinations about what they're sacraments are—what they recognize.",7
2012-05-10,oba,But from the perspective of—of the law and perspective of the state—I think it's important—to say that in this country we've always been about—fairness.,8
2012-05-10,oba,And—and treatin' everybody—as equals.,2
2012-05-10,oba,Or at least that's been our aspiration.,2
2012-05-10,oba,"And I think—that applies here, as well.",3
2012-05-10,oba,I would.,1
2012-05-10,oba,And—and that's—that's part of the—the evolution that I went through.,5
2012-05-10,oba,"I asked myself—right after that New York vote took place, if I had been a state senator, which I was for a time—how would I have voted?",8
2012-05-10,oba,"And I had to admit to myself, ""You know what?",3
2012-05-10,oba,"I think that—I would have voted yes.""",2
2012-05-10,oba,"It would have been hard for me, knowing—all the friends and family—that—are gays or lesbians, that for me to say to them, you know, ""I voted to oppose you having—the same kind of rights—and responsibilities—that I have.""",6
2012-05-10,oba,"And—you know, it's interesting.",2
2012-05-10,oba,Some of this is also generational.,3
2012-05-10,oba,"You know, when I go to college campuses, sometimes I talk to college Republicans who think that—I have terrible policies on the—the economy or on foreign policy.",9
2012-05-10,oba,"But are very clear that when it comes to same-sex equality or, you know—sexual orientation that they believe in equality.",5
2012-05-10,oba,They're much more comfortable with it.,3
2012-05-10,oba,"You know, Malia and Sasha, they've got friends whose parents are same-sex couples.",5
2012-05-10,oba,"And I—you know, there have been times where Michelle and I have been sittin' around the dinner table.",6
2012-05-10,oba,And we've been talkin' and—about their friends and their parents.,4
2012-05-10,oba,And Malia and Sasha would—it wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their friends' parents would be treated differently.,4
2012-05-10,oba,It doesn't make sense to them.,2
2012-05-10,oba,And—and frankly—that's the kind of thing that prompts—a change of perspective.,4
2012-05-10,oba,"You know, not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated—differently, when it comes to—the eyes of the law.",7
2012-05-10,oba,"Well, I—you know, my Justice Department has already—said that it is not gonna defend—the Defense Against Marriage Act.",4
2012-05-10,oba,That we consider that a violation of equal protection clause.,5
2012-05-10,oba,And I agree with them on that.,2
2012-05-10,oba,You know?,1
2012-05-10,oba,I helped to prompt that—that move on the part of the Justice Department.,6
2012-05-10,oba,"Part of the reason that I thought it was important—to speak to this issue was the fact that—you know, I've got an opponent on—on the other side in the upcoming presidential election, who wants to—re-federalize the issue and—institute a constitutional amendment—that would prohibit gay marriage.",11
2012-05-10,oba,"And, you know, I think it is a mistake to—try to make what has traditionally been a state issue into a national issue.",7
2012-05-10,oba,"I think that—you know, the winds of change are happening.",4
2012-05-10,oba,They're not blowin'—with the same force in every state.,5
2012-05-10,oba,"But I think that what you're gonna see is states—coming to—the realization that if—if a soldier can fight for us, if a police officer can protect our neighborhoods—if a fire fighter is expected to go into a burning building—to save our possessions or our kids.",8
2012-05-10,oba,"The notion that after they were done with that, that we'd say to them, ""Oh but by the way, we're gonna treat you differently.",5
2012-05-10,oba,"That you may not be able to—enjoy—the—the ability of—of passing on—what you have to your loved one, if you—if you die.",7
2012-05-10,oba,"The notion that somehow if—if you get sick, your loved one might have trouble visiting you in a hospital.""",6
2012-05-10,oba,"You know, I think that as more and more folks think about it, they're gonna say, you know, ""That's not who we are.""",5
2012-05-10,oba,"And as I said, I want to—I want to emphasize—that—I've got a lot of friends—on the other side of this issue.",7
2012-05-10,oba,"You know, I'm sure they'll be callin' me up and—and I respect them.",4
2012-05-10,oba,"And I understand their perspective, in part, because—their impulse is the right one.",3
2012-05-10,oba,Which is they want to—they want to preserve and strengthen families.,3
2012-05-10,oba,And I think they're concerned about—won't you see families breaking down.,3
2012-05-10,oba,"It's just that—maybe they haven't had the experience that I have had in seeing same-sex couples, who are as committed, as monogamous, as responsible—as loving of a group of parents as—any—heterosexual couple that I know.",14
2012-05-10,oba,"And in some cases, more so.",3
2012-05-10,oba,"And, you know—if you look at the underlying values that we care so deeply about when we describe family, commitment, responsibility, lookin' after one another—you know, teaching—our kids to—to be responsible citizens and—caring for one another—I actually think that—you know, it's consistent with our best and in some cases our most conservative values, sort of the foundation of what—made this country great.",10
2012-06-29,oba,Good afternoon.,1
2012-06-29,oba,"Earlier today, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act -- the name of the health care reform we passed two years ago.",6
2012-06-29,oba,"In doing so, they've reaffirmed a fundamental principle that here in America -- in the wealthiest nation on Earth – no illness or accident should lead to any family’s financial ruin.",6
2012-06-29,oba,"I know there will be a lot of discussion today about the politics of all this, about who won and who lost.",7
2012-06-29,oba,That’s how these things tend to be viewed here in Washington.,4
2012-06-29,oba,But that discussion completely misses the point.,2
2012-06-29,oba,"Whatever the politics, today’s decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives will be more secure because of this law and the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold it.",6
2012-06-29,oba,"And because this law has a direct impact on so many Americans, I want to take this opportunity to talk about exactly what it means for you.",7
2012-06-29,oba,"First, if you’re one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance -- this law will only make it more secure and more affordable.",8
2012-06-29,oba,Insurance companies can no longer impose lifetime limits on the amount of care you receive.,5
2012-06-29,oba,They can no longer discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.,3
2012-06-29,oba,They can no longer drop your coverage if you get sick.,2
2012-06-29,oba,They can no longer jack up your premiums without reason.,2
2012-06-29,oba,They are required to provide free preventive care like check-ups and mammograms -- a provision that's already helped 54 million Americans with private insurance.,7
2012-06-29,oba,"And by this August, nearly 13 million of you will receive a rebate from your insurance company because it spent too much on things like administrative costs and CEO bonuses, and not enough on your health care.",7
2012-06-29,oba,There’s more.,1
2012-06-29,oba,"Because of the Affordable Care Act, young adults under the age of 26 are able to stay on their parent's health care plans -- a provision that's already helped 6 million young Americans.",9
2012-06-29,oba,"And because of the Affordable Care Act, seniors receive a discount on their prescription drugs -- a discount that's already saved more than 5 million seniors on Medicare about $600 each.",10
2012-06-29,oba,All of this is happening because of the Affordable Care Act.,4
2012-06-29,oba,"These provisions provide common-sense protections for middle class families, and they enjoy broad popular support.",5
2012-06-29,oba,"And thanks to today’s decision, all of these benefits and protections will continue for Americans who already have health insurance.",5
2012-06-29,oba,"Now, if you’re one of the 30 million Americans who don’t yet have health insurance, starting in 2014 this law will offer you an array of quality, affordable, private health insurance plans to choose from.",7
2012-06-29,oba,"Each state will take the lead in designing their own menu of options, and if states can come up with even better ways of covering more people at the same quality and cost, this law allows them to do that, too.",9
2012-06-29,oba,"And I’ve asked Congress to help speed up that process, and give states this flexibility in year one.",4
2012-06-29,oba,"Once states set up these health insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against any American with a preexisting health condition.",5
2012-06-29,oba,They won’t be able to charge you more just because you’re a woman.,5
2012-06-29,oba,They won’t be able to bill you into bankruptcy.,4
2012-06-29,oba,"If you’re sick, you’ll finally have the same chance to get quality, affordable health care as everyone else.",5
2012-06-29,oba,"And if you can’t afford the premiums, you'll receive a credit that helps pay for it.",4
2012-06-29,oba,"Today, the Supreme Court also upheld the principle that people who can afford health insurance should take the responsibility to buy health insurance.",6
2012-06-29,oba,This is important for two reasons.,3
2012-06-29,oba,"First, when uninsured people who can afford coverage get sick, and show up at the emergency room for care, the rest of us end up paying for their care in the form of higher premiums.",6
2012-06-29,oba,"And second, if you ask insurance companies to cover people with preexisting conditions, but don’t require people who can afford it to buy their own insurance, some folks might wait until they’re sick to buy the care they need -- which would also drive up everybody else’s premiums.",8
2012-06-29,oba,"That’s why, even though I knew it wouldn’t be politically popular, and resisted the idea when I ran for this office, we ultimately included a provision in the Affordable Care Act that people who can afford to buy health insurance should take the responsibility to do so.",8
2012-06-29,oba,"In fact, this idea has enjoyed support from members of both parties, including the current Republican nominee for President.",6
2012-06-29,oba,"Still, I know the debate over this law has been divisive.",5
2012-06-29,oba,I respect the very real concerns that millions of Americans have shared.,5
2012-06-29,oba,And I know a lot of coverage through this health care debate has focused on what it means politically.,6
2012-06-29,oba,"Well, it should be pretty clear by now that I didn’t do this because it was good politics.",4
2012-06-29,oba,I did it because I believed it was good for the country.,6
2012-06-29,oba,I did it because I believed it was good for the American people.,6
2012-06-29,oba,There’s a framed letter that hangs in my office right now.,5
2012-06-29,oba,It was sent to me during the health care debate by a woman named Natoma Canfield.,7
2012-06-29,oba,"For years and years, Natoma did everything right.",3
2012-06-29,oba,She bought health insurance.,2
2012-06-29,oba,She paid her premiums on time.,2
2012-06-29,oba,"But 18 years ago, Natoma was diagnosed with cancer.",3
2012-06-29,oba,"And even though she’d been cancer-free for more than a decade, her insurance company kept jacking up her rates, year after year.",6
2012-06-29,oba,"And despite her desire to keep her coverage -- despite her fears that she would get sick again -- she had to surrender her health insurance, and was forced to hang her fortunes on chance.",5
2012-06-29,oba,I carried Natoma’s story with me every day of the fight to pass this law.,4
2012-06-29,oba,"It reminded me of all the Americans, all across the country, who have had to worry not only about getting sick, but about the cost of getting well.",10
2012-06-29,oba,Natoma is well today.,1
2012-06-29,oba,"And because of this law, there are other Americans -- other sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers -- who will not have to hang their fortunes on chance.",5
2012-06-29,oba,These are the Americans for whom we passed this law.,4
2012-06-29,oba,The highest Court in the land has now spoken.,4
2012-06-29,oba,We will continue to implement this law.,3
2012-06-29,oba,And we'll work together to improve on it where we can.,4
2012-06-29,oba,"But what we won’t do -- what the country can’t afford to do -- is refight the political battles of two years ago, or go back to the way things were.",6
2012-06-29,oba,"With today’s announcement, it’s time for us to move forward -- to implement and, where necessary, improve on this law.",5
2012-06-29,oba,"And now is the time to keep our focus on the most urgent challenge of our time:  putting people back to work, paying down our debt, and building an economy where people can have confidence that if they work hard, they can get ahead.",10
2012-06-29,oba,"But today, I’m as confident as ever that when we look back five years from now, or 10 years from now, or 20 years from now, we’ll be better off because we had the courage to pass this law and keep moving forward.",7
2012-06-29,oba,Thank you.,1
2012-06-29,oba,"God bless you, and God bless America.",2
2012-07-21,oba,"Let me first of all say how grateful I am for all of you being here, and how -- how much we appreciate everything that you've done.",6
2012-07-21,oba,"I know that there are a lot of people here who have been so engaged in the campaign, have sacrificed so much, people who've been involved back since 2007.",8
2012-07-21,oba,And...so I...want all of you to know how appreciative I am.,4
2012-07-21,oba,And I know many of you came here today for a campaign event.,4
2012-07-21,oba,I was looking forward to having a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as a country and the differences between myself and my opponent in this election.,12
2012-07-21,oba,"But this morning, we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways that we are united as one American family.",11
2012-07-21,oba,"By now, many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver, in a town call Aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater, and dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital.",5
2012-07-21,oba,Some of the victims are being treated at a children’s hospital.,4
2012-07-21,oba,"Now, we’re still gathering all the facts about what happened in Aurora, but what we do know is that the police have one suspect in custody.",5
2012-07-21,oba,And the federal government stands ready to do whatever is necessary to bring whoever is responsible for this heinous crime to justice -- and we will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people.,10
2012-07-21,oba,We're going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.,5
2012-07-21,oba,"And I had a chance to speak with the Mayor of Aurora as well as the Governor of Colorado to express, not just on behalf of Michelle and myself, but the entire American family, how heartbroken we are.",8
2012-07-21,oba,"Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understand what leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this.",5
2012-07-21,oba,"Such violence, such evil is senseless.",2
2012-07-21,oba,It's beyond reason.,2
2012-07-21,oba,"But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we do know what makes life worth living.",6
2012-07-21,oba,The people we lost in Aurora loved and they were loved.,4
2012-07-21,oba,"They were mothers and fathers; they were husbands and wives; sisters and brothers; sons and daughters, friends and neighbors.",5
2012-07-21,oba,They had hopes for the future and they had dreams that were not yet fulfilled.,4
2012-07-21,oba,And if there’s anything to take away from this tragedy it’s the reminder that life is very fragile.,7
2012-07-21,oba,Our time here is limited and it is precious.,2
2012-07-21,oba,"And what matters at the end of the day is not the small things; it’s not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives.",7
2012-07-21,oba,"Ultimately, it’s how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another.",4
2012-07-21,oba,It’s -- It's what we do on a daily basis to give our lives meaning and to give our lives purpose.,1
2012-07-21,oba,That’s what matters.,2

2012-09-07,oba,"You're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home; why selfless soldiers won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love; why thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely: ""Welcome home.""",12
2012-09-07,oba,Welcome home.,1
2012-09-07,oba,You did that.,1
2012-09-07,oba,You did that.,1
2012-09-07,oba,You did that.,1

2012-09-07,oba,"If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference, then other voices will fill the void -- the lobbyists and special interests, the people with the 10 million dollar checks who are trying to buy this election and those who are trying to make it harder for you to vote, Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry or control health care choices that women should be making for themselves.",13
2012-09-07,oba,Only you can make sure that doesn't happen.,3
2012-09-07,oba,Only you have the power to move us forward.,3
2012-09-07,oba,"You know, I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention.",5

2012-09-07,oba,"And while I'm very proud of what we've achieved together, I'm far more mindful of my own failings -- knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said, ""I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.""",9
2012-09-07,oba,"But as I stand here tonight, I have never been more hopeful about America; not because I think I have all the answers; not because I'm naive about the magnitude of our challenges -- I'm hopeful because of you.",7
2012-09-07,oba,The young woman I met at a science fair who won national recognition for her biology research while living with her family at a homeless shelter -- she gives me hope.,8
2012-09-07,oba,"The auto worker who won the lottery after his plant almost closed, but kept coming to work every day, and bought flags for his whole town and one of the cars that he built to surprise his wife -- he gives me hope.",12
2012-09-07,oba,"The family business in Warroad, Minnesota, that didn't lay off a single one of their 4,000 employees when the recession hit, even when their competitors shut down dozens of plants, even when it meant the owner gave up some perks and some pay, because they understood that their biggest asset was the community and the workers who had helped build that business -- they give me hope.",10
2012-09-07,oba,I think about the young sailor I met at Walter Reed Hospital still recovering from a grenade attack that would cause him to have his leg amputated above the knee.,12
2012-09-07,oba,"And six months ago we would watch him walk into a White House dinner honoring those who served in Iran [Iraq], tall and 20 pounds heavier, dashing in his uniform, with a big grin on his face, sturdy on his new leg.",8

2012-10-29,oba,"Hello, everybody.",1
2012-10-29,oba,"I just received a full briefing from our emergency response teams, including FEMA, and agencies that are going to be helpful in the response and recovery efforts -- the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services.",11
2012-10-29,oba,"Obviously, everybody is aware at this point that this is going to be a big and powerful storm.",5
2012-10-29,oba,"And all across the Eastern seaboard, I think everybody is taking the appropriate preparations.",3
2012-10-29,oba,I’ve spoken to all the governors in all these states.,3
2012-10-29,oba,They have issues emergency declarations.,2
2012-10-29,oba,Those have been turned around quickly here in the White House.,3
2012-10-29,oba,We have prepositioned assets so that FEMA personnel are working closely with state and local governments.,5
2012-10-29,oba,We’re making sure that food and water and emergency generation is available for those communities that are going to be hardest hit.,8
2012-10-29,oba,We anticipate that the center of the storm is going to land fall sometime this evening.,5
2012-10-29,oba,"But because of the nature of this storm, we are certain that this is going to be a slow-moving process through a wide swath of the country, and millions of people are going to be affected.",8
2012-10-29,oba,"So the most important message that I have for the public right now is, please listen to what your state and local officials are saying.",6
2012-10-29,oba,"When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate.",3
2012-10-29,oba,Do not delay.,1
2012-10-29,oba,"Don’t pause; don’t question the instructions that are being given, because this is a serious storm and it could potentially have fatal consequence if people haven’t acted quickly.",4
2012-10-29,oba,"The good news is, is that the governors and local officials I think have had a few days of preparation.",5
2012-10-29,oba,"There's been extraordinarily close coordination between state, federal, and local governments.",6
2012-10-29,oba,And so we’re confident that the assets are prepositioned for an effective response in the aftermath of the storm.,9
2012-10-29,oba,"But keep in mind that for folks who are not following instructions, if you are not evacuating when you’ve been asked to evacuate, you’re putting first responders at danger.",5
2012-10-29,oba,We’re going to have to have search-and-rescue teams in and around multiple states all at the same time.,7
2012-10-29,oba,"And although we’ve got Coast Guard and the Department of Defense all positioned, if the public is not following instructions, that makes it more dangerous for people and it means that we could have fatalities that could have been avoided.",5
2012-10-29,oba,Transportation is going to be tied up for a long time.,4
2012-10-29,oba,"And probably the most significant impact for a lot of people, in addition to flooding, is going to be getting power back on.",5
2012-10-29,oba,"We anticipate that there are going to be a lot of trees down, a lot of water.",5
2012-10-29,oba,"And despite the fact that the power companies are working very closely with their various state officials and local officials to make sure that they are bringing in as many assets as possible and getting those ready in preparation for the storm, the fact is that a lot of these emergency crews are not going to be able to get into position to start restoring power until some of these winds have died down.",12
2012-10-29,oba,"And because of the nature of this storm, that may take several days.",5
2012-10-29,oba,"So the public should anticipate that there’s going to be a lot of power outages, and it may take time for that power to get back on.",6
2012-10-29,oba,"The same is true with transportation; there are going to be a lot of backlogs, and even after the storm has cleared, it’s going to take a considerable amount of time for airlines, subways, trains, and so forth, potentially to get back on schedule, depending on the amount of damage that has occurred.",9
2012-10-29,oba,Let me summarize just by saying that I’m extraordinarily grateful for the cooperation of our state and local officials.,11
2012-10-29,oba,The conversations that I’ve had with all the governors indicate that at this point there are no unmet needs.,5
2012-10-29,oba,I think everybody is taking this very seriously.,3
2012-10-29,oba,We’ve gotten prepositioned all the resources that we need.,3
2012-10-29,oba,"But right now, the key is to make sure that the public is following instructions.",5
2012-10-29,oba,"For those of you who still need additional information about how to respond, you can go to Ready.gov -- that’s Ready.gov.",8
2012-10-29,oba,And that website should provide you with all the information that your family needs in terms of how you can prepare for this storm.,10
2012-10-29,oba,Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the people who are potentially affected.,4
2012-10-29,oba,"We are extraordinarily grateful for our first responders, because they’re going to be working 24/7 around the clock, non-stop.",5
2012-10-29,oba,And I want to make sure that our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who may end up be dealing with a very difficult situation over the next several days.,7
2012-10-29,oba,"Last point I’ll make, though -- this is going to be a big storm.",3
2012-10-29,oba,It’s going to be a difficult storm.,3
2012-10-29,oba,The great thing about America is when we go through tough times like this we all pull together.,6
2012-10-29,oba,We look out for our friends.,3
2012-10-29,oba,We look out for our neighbors.,3
2012-10-29,oba,And we set aside whatever issues we may have otherwise to make sure that we respond appropriately and with swiftness.,6
2012-10-29,oba,And that’s exactly what I anticipate is going to happen here.,3
2012-10-29,oba,"So I want to thank all the federal teams, state and local teams that are in place.",6
2012-10-29,oba,I’m confident that we’re ready.,3
2012-10-29,oba,But I think the public needs to prepare for the fact that this is going to take a long time for us to clean up.,9
2012-10-29,oba,The good news is we will clean up and we will get through this.,4
2012-10-29,oba,"Question: What about the impact on the election, sir?",5
2012-10-29,oba,President Obama: I am not worried at this point about the impact on the election.,8
2012-10-29,oba,"I’m worried about the impact on families, and I’m worried about the impact on our first responders.",7
2012-10-29,oba,I’m worried about the impact on our economy and on transportation.,6
2012-10-29,oba,The election will take care of itself next week.,2
2012-10-29,oba,"Right now, our number-one priority is to make sure that we are saving lives, that our search-and-rescue teams are going to be in place, that people are going to get the food, the water, the shelter that they need in case of emergency, and that we respond as quickly as possible to get the economy back on track.",11
2012-10-29,oba,"Thank you, everybody.",1
2012-11-07,oba,Thank you.,1
2012-11-07,oba,Thank you so much.,2
2012-11-07,oba,"Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.",5
2012-11-07,oba,It moves forward because of you.,2
2012-11-07,oba,"It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression; the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope -- the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family, and we rise or fall together, as one nation, and as one people.",10
2012-11-07,oba,"Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come.",7
2012-11-07,oba,I want to thank every American who participated in this election.,6
2012-11-07,oba,"Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time -- by the way, we have to fix that.",6
2012-11-07,oba,"Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone -- whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard, and you made a difference.",5
2012-11-07,oba,"I just spoke with Governor Romney, and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard-fought campaign.",5
2012-11-07,oba,"We may have battled fiercely, but it’s only because we love this country deeply, and we care so strongly about its future.",5
2012-11-07,oba,"From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service, and that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.",5
2012-11-07,oba,"In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.",8
2012-11-07,oba,"I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, America’s happy warrior -- the best Vice President anybody could ever hope for -- Joe Biden.",5
2012-11-07,oba,And I wouldn’t be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.,7

2012-11-07,oba,"But I will say that for now, one dog is probably enough.",3
2012-11-07,oba,To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics -- the best.,6
2012-11-07,oba,The best ever.,1
2012-11-07,oba,"Some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning.",4
2012-11-07,oba,But all of you are family.,3
2012-11-07,oba,"No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together, and you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful President.",5
2012-11-07,oba,"Thank you for believing all the way, through every hill, through every valley.",4
2012-11-07,oba,You lifted me up the whole way.,3
2012-11-07,oba,And I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in.,6
2012-11-07,oba,"I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly.",3
2012-11-07,oba,"And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos, or the domain of special interests.",12
2012-11-07,oba,"But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies, and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym, or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else.",14
2012-11-07,oba,"You’ll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who’s worked his way through college, and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.",11
2012-11-07,oba,You’ll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who’s going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.,10
2012-11-07,oba,"You’ll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who’s working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job, or a roof over their head when they come home.",14
2012-11-07,oba,That’s why we do this.,2
2012-11-07,oba,That’s what politics can be.,2
2012-11-07,oba,That’s why elections matter.,2
2012-11-07,oba,It's not small; it's big.,2
2012-11-07,oba,It's important.,1
2012-11-07,oba,Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated.,6
2012-11-07,oba,We have our own opinions.,2
2012-11-07,oba,Each of us has deeply held beliefs.,3
2012-11-07,oba,"And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.",5
2012-11-07,oba,That won’t change after tonight -- and it shouldn’t.,2
2012-11-07,oba,"These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty, and we can never forget that as we speak, people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter, the chance to cast their ballots like we did today.",9
2012-11-07,oba,"But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America’s future.",5
2012-11-07,oba,"We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers -- a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation, with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow.",19

2012-11-07,oba,"We believe in a generous America; in a compassionate America; in a tolerant America, open to the dreams of an immigrant’s daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag.",9

2012-11-07,oba,It's not always a straight line.,2

2012-11-07,oba,"Our university,  culture are the envy of the world, but that’s not what keeps the world coming to our shores.",6
2012-11-07,oba,"What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on Earth -- the belief that our destiny is shared; that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another, and to future generations; that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for comes with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism.",7
2012-11-07,oba,That's what makes America great.,3

2012-11-07,oba,And I ask you to sustain that hope.,3
2012-11-07,oba,I’m not talking about blind optimism -- the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path.,10

2013-01-16,oba,They’re pretty representative of some of the messages that I got.,7
2013-01-16,oba,These are some pretty smart letters from some pretty smart young people.,5
2013-01-16,oba,"Hinna, a third-grader -- you can go ahead and wave, Hinna.",3
2013-01-16,oba,That’s you.,1
2013-01-16,oba,"Hinna wrote, “I feel terrible for the parents who lost their children...I love my country and want everybody to be happy and safe.” And then, Grant -- go ahead and wave, Grant.",6
2013-01-16,oba,"Grant said, “I think there should be some changes.",4
2013-01-16,oba,"We should learn from what happened at Sandy Hook...I feel really bad.” And then, Julia said -- Julia, where are you?",5
2013-01-16,oba,"There you go -- “I’m not scared for my safety, I’m scared for others.",5
2013-01-16,oba,I have four brothers and sisters and I know I would not be able to bear the thought of losing any of them.” These are our kids.,10
2013-01-16,oba,This is what they’re thinking about.,3
2013-01-16,oba,"And so what we should be thinking about is our responsibility to care for them, and shield them from harm, and give them the tools they need to grow up and do everything that they’re capable of doing -- not just to pursue their own dreams, but to help build this country.",13
2013-01-16,oba,"This is our first task as a society, keeping our children safe.",4
2013-01-16,oba,This is how we will be judged.,2
2013-01-16,oba,And their voices should compel us to change.,2
2013-01-16,oba,"And that’s why, last month, I asked Joe to lead an effort, along with members of my Cabinet, to come up with some concrete steps we can take right now to keep our children safe, to help prevent mass shootings, to reduce the broader epidemic of gun violence in this country.",11
2013-01-16,oba,And we can't put this off any longer.,2
2013-01-16,oba,"Just last Thursday, as TV networks were covering one of Joe’s meetings on this topic, news broke of another school shooting, this one in California.",7
2013-01-16,oba,"In the month since 20 precious children and six brave adults were violently taken from us at Sandy Hook Elementary, more than 900 of our fellow Americans have reportedly died at the end of a gun -- 900 in the past month.",5
2013-01-16,oba,"And every day we wait, that number will keep growing.",3
2013-01-16,oba,So I’m putting forward a specific set of proposals based on the work of Joe’s task force.,10
2013-01-16,oba,"And in the days ahead, I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality.",5
2013-01-16,oba,"Because while there is no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil, if there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there is even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try.",10
2013-01-16,oba,And I’m going to do my part.,3
2013-01-16,oba,"As soon as I'm finished speaking here, I will sit at that desk and I will sign a directive giving law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals and the public health community some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence.",11
2013-01-16,oba,We will make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by strengthening the background check system.,7
2013-01-16,oba,We will help schools hire more resource officers if they want them and develop emergency preparedness plans.,5
2013-01-16,oba,We will make sure mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of violence -- even as we acknowledge that someone with a mental illness is far more likely to be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator.,10
2013-01-16,oba,"And while year after year, those who oppose even modest gun safety measures have threatened to defund scientific or medical research into the causes of gun violence, I will direct the Centers for Disease Control to go ahead and study the best ways to reduce it -- and Congress should fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds.",7
2013-01-16,oba,We don't benefit from ignorance.,2
2013-01-16,oba,We don't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence.,7
2013-01-16,oba,These are a few of the 23 executive actions that I’m announcing today.,5
2013-01-16,oba,"But as important as these steps are, they are in no way a substitute for action from members of Congress.",7
2013-01-16,oba,"To make a real and lasting difference, Congress, too, must act -- and Congress must act soon.",4
2013-01-16,oba,And I’m calling on Congress to pass some very specific proposals right away.,4
2013-01-16,oba,First: It’s time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun.,9
2013-01-16,oba,"The law already requires licensed gun dealers to run background checks, and over the last 14 years that’s kept 1.5 million of the wrong people from getting their hands on a gun.",6
2013-01-16,oba,But it’s hard to enforce that law when as many as 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without a background check.,5
2013-01-16,oba,That’s not safe.,1
2013-01-16,oba,That's not smart.,1
2013-01-16,oba,It’s not fair to responsible gun buyers or sellers.,4
2013-01-16,oba,If you want to buy a gun -- whether it’s from a licensed dealer or a private seller -- you should at least have to show you are not a felon or somebody legally prohibited from buying one.,7
2013-01-16,oba,This is common sense.,2
2013-01-16,oba,"And an overwhelming majority of Americans agree with us on the need for universal background checks -- including more than 70 percent of the National Rifle Association’s members, according to one survey.",10
2013-01-16,oba,So there’s no reason we can’t do this.,3
2013-01-16,oba,"Second: Congress should restore a ban on military-style assault weapons, and a 10-round limit for magazines.",5
2013-01-16,oba,"The type of assault rifle used in Aurora, for example, when paired with high-capacity magazines, has one purpose -- to pump out as many bullets as possible, as quickly as possible; to do as much damage, using bullets often designed to inflict maximum damage.",8
2013-01-16,oba,And that's what allowed the gunman in Aurora to shoot 70 people -- 70 people -- killing 12 in a matter of minutes.,6
2013-01-16,oba,Weapons designed for the theater of war have no place in a movie theater.,6
2013-01-16,oba,A majority of Americans agree with us on this.,3
2013-01-16,oba,"And, by the way, so did Ronald Reagan, one of the staunchest defenders of the Second Amendment, who wrote to Congress in 1994, urging them -- this is Ronald Reagan speaking -- urging them to “listen to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of weapons.” And finally, Congress needs to help, rather than hinder, law enforcement as it does its job.",11
2013-01-16,oba,We should get tougher on people who buy guns with the express purpose of turning around and selling them to criminals.,11
2013-01-16,oba,And we should severely punish anybody who helps them do this.,4
2013-01-16,oba,"Since Congress hasn’t confirmed a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in six years, they should confirm Todd Jones, who will be -- who has been Acting, and I will be nominating for the post.",8
2013-01-16,oba,"And at a time when budget cuts are forcing many communities to reduce their police force, we should put more cops back on the job and back on our streets.",6
2013-01-16,oba,Let me be absolutely clear.,3
2013-01-16,oba,"Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms.",3
2013-01-16,oba,I respect our strong tradition of gun ownership and the rights of hunters and sportsmen.,5
2013-01-16,oba,"There are millions of responsible, law-abiding gun owners in America who cherish their right to bear arms for hunting, or sport, or protection, or collection.",9
2013-01-16,oba,"I also believe most gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.",8
2013-01-16,oba,"I believe most of them agree that if America worked harder to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, there would be fewer atrocities like the one that occurred in Newtown.",10
2013-01-16,oba,That’s what these reforms are designed to do.,3
2013-01-16,oba,They’re common-sense measures.,3
2013-01-16,oba,They have the support of the majority of the American people.,6
2013-01-16,oba,"And yet, that doesn’t mean any of this is going to be easy to enact or implement.",4
2013-01-16,oba,"If it were, we’d already have universal background checks.",2
2013-01-16,oba,The ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines never would have been allowed to expire.,6
2013-01-16,oba,"More of our fellow Americans might still be alive, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries and graduations.",4
2013-01-16,oba,This will be difficult.,1
2013-01-16,oba,"There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning of a tyrannical, all-out assault on liberty -- not because that’s true, but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue for themselves.",6
2013-01-16,oba,"And behind the scenes, they’ll do everything they can to block any common-sense reform and make sure nothing changes whatsoever.",6
2013-01-16,oba,"The only way we will be able to change is if their audience, their constituents, their membership says this time must be different -- that this time, we must do something to protect our communities and our kids.",7
2013-01-16,oba,"I will put everything I've got into this, and so will Joe.",4
2013-01-16,oba,"But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it.",4
2013-01-16,oba,"And by the way, that doesn’t just mean from certain parts of the country.",5
2013-01-16,oba,"We're going to need voices in those areas, in those congressional districts, where the tradition of gun ownership is strong to speak up and to say this is important.",9
2013-01-16,oba,It can't just be the usual suspects.,2
2013-01-16,oba,"We have to examine ourselves and our hearts, and ask ourselves what is important.",4
2013-01-16,oba,This will not happen unless the American people demand it.,3
2013-01-16,oba,"If parents and teachers, police officers and pastors, if hunters and sportsmen, if responsible gun owners, if Americans of every background stand up and say, enough; we’ve suffered too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue -- then change will come.",6
2013-01-16,oba,That's what it's going to take.,3
2013-01-16,oba,"In the letter that Julia wrote me, she said, “I know that laws have to be passed by Congress, but I beg you to try very hard.” Julia, I will try very hard.",5
2013-01-16,oba,But she’s right.,1
2013-01-16,oba,The most important changes we can make depend on congressional action.,5
2013-01-16,oba,"They need to bring these proposals up for a vote, and the American people need to make sure that they do.",5
2013-01-16,oba,Get them on record.,2
2013-01-16,oba,Ask your member of Congress if they support universal background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands.,6
2013-01-16,oba,Ask them if they support renewing a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.,8
2013-01-16,oba,"And if they say no, ask them why not.",2
2013-01-16,oba,"Ask them what’s more important -- doing whatever it takes to get a A grade from the gun lobby that funds their campaigns, or giving parents some peace of mind when they drop their child off for first grade?",10
2013-01-16,oba,"This is the land of the free, and it always will be.",4
2013-01-16,oba,"As Americans, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights that no man or government can take away from us.",6
2013-01-16,oba,"But we've also long recognized, as our Founders recognized, that with rights come responsibilities.",3
2013-01-16,oba,Along with our freedom to live our lives as we will comes an obligation to allow others to do the same.,6
2013-01-16,oba,We don’t live in isolation.,2
2013-01-16,oba,"We live in a society, a government of, and by, and for the people.",5
2013-01-16,oba,We are responsible for each other.,4
2013-01-16,oba,"The right to worship freely and safely, that right was denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.",6
2013-01-16,oba,"The right to assemble peaceably, that right was denied shoppers in Clackamas, Oregon, and moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado.",8
2013-01-16,oba,"That most fundamental set of rights to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- fundamental rights that were denied to college students at Virginia Tech, and high school students at Columbine, and elementary school students in Newtown, and kids on street corners in Chicago on too frequent a basis to tolerate, and all the families who’ve never imagined that they’d lose a loved one to a bullet -- those rights are at stake.",12
2013-01-16,oba,We’re responsible.,1
2013-01-16,oba,"When I visited Newtown last month, I spent some private time with many of the families who lost their children that day.",7

2013-01-16,oba,She dreamed of becoming a painter.,4
2013-01-16,oba,"And so just before I left, Chris, her father, gave me one of her paintings, and I hung it in my private study just off the Oval Office.",4
2013-01-16,oba,"And every time I look at that painting, I think about Grace.",5
2013-01-16,oba,"And I think about the life that she lived and the life that lay ahead of her, and most of all, I think about how, when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now -- for Grace.",8
2013-01-16,oba,For the 25 other innocent children and devoted educators who had so much left to give.,4
2013-01-16,oba,For the men and women in big cities and small towns who fall victim to senseless violence each and every day.,10

2013-01-22,oba,"Together we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce, schools and colleges to train our workers.",5

2013-01-30,oba,"And during my inaugural address, I talked about how making progress on the defining challenges of our time doesn’t require us to settle every debate or ignore every difference that we may have, but it does require us to find common ground and move forward in common purpose.",9
2013-01-30,oba,It requires us to act.,2
2013-01-30,oba,I know that some issues will be harder to lift than others.,5
2013-01-30,oba,Some debates will be more contentious.,2
2013-01-30,oba,That’s to be expected.,2
2013-01-30,oba,But the reason I came here today is because of a challenge where the differences are dwindling; where a broad consensus is emerging; and where a call for action can now be heard coming from all across America.,5
2013-01-30,oba,"I’m here today because the time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform.",5
2013-01-30,oba,The time is now.,2
2013-01-30,oba,Now is the time.,2
2013-01-30,oba,Now is the time.,2
2013-01-30,oba,Now is the time.,2
2013-01-30,oba,Audience:  Sí se puede!,2
2013-01-30,oba,Sí se puede!,1
2013-01-30,oba,President Obama:  Now is the time.,2
2013-01-30,oba,I’m here because most Americans agree that it’s time to fix a system that’s been broken for way too long.,8
2013-01-30,oba,"I’m here because business leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, law enforcement, and leaders from both parties are coming together to say now is the time to find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as the land of opportunity.",12
2013-01-30,oba,Now is the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our country’s future.,5
2013-01-30,oba,Think about it -- we define ourselves as a nation of immigrants.,4
2013-01-30,oba,That’s who we are -- in our bones.,3
2013-01-30,oba,"The promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe, that’s always been one of our greatest strengths.",10
2013-01-30,oba,It keeps our workforce young.,2
2013-01-30,oba,It keeps our country on the cutting edge.,3
2013-01-30,oba,And it’s helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known.,5
2013-01-30,oba,"After all, immigrants helped start businesses like Google and Yahoo!.",5
2013-01-30,oba,"They created entire new industries that, in turn, created new jobs and new prosperity for our citizens.",7
2013-01-30,oba,"In recent years, one in four high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants.",5
2013-01-30,oba,"One in four new small business owners were immigrants, including right here in Nevada -- folks who came here seeking opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other Americans.",9
2013-01-30,oba,"But we all know that today, we have an immigration system that’s out of date and badly broken; a system that’s holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class.",7
2013-01-30,oba,"Right now, we have 11 million undocumented immigrants in America; 11 million men and women from all over the world who live their lives in the shadows.",8
2013-01-30,oba,"Yes, they broke the rules.",2
2013-01-30,oba,They crossed the border illegally.,2
2013-01-30,oba,Maybe they overstayed their visas.,2
2013-01-30,oba,Those are facts.,1
2013-01-30,oba,Nobody disputes them.,1
2013-01-30,oba,But these 11 million men and women are now here.,3
2013-01-30,oba,Many of them have been here for years.,3
2013-01-30,oba,And the overwhelming majority of these individuals aren’t looking for any trouble.,4
2013-01-30,oba,They’re contributing members of the community.,4
2013-01-30,oba,They're looking out for their families.,3
2013-01-30,oba,They're looking out for their neighbors.,3
2013-01-30,oba,They're woven into the fabric of our lives.,5
2013-01-30,oba,"Every day, like the rest of us, they go out and try to earn a living.",4
2013-01-30,oba,Often they do that in a shadow economy -- a place where employers may offer them less than the minimum wage or make them work overtime without extra pay.,9
2013-01-30,oba,"And when that happens, it’s not just bad for them, it’s bad for the entire economy.",4
2013-01-30,oba,"Because all the businesses that are trying to do the right thing -- that are hiring people legally, paying a decent wage, following the rules -- they’re the ones who suffer.",9
2013-01-30,oba,They've got to compete against companies that are breaking the rules.,6
2013-01-30,oba,"And the wages and working conditions of American workers are threatened, too.",4
2013-01-30,oba,"So if we're truly committed to strengthening our middle class and providing more ladders of opportunity to those who are willing to work hard to make it into the middle class, we've got to fix the system.",14
2013-01-30,oba,We have to make sure that every business and every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules.,7
2013-01-30,oba,"We have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable -- businesses for who they hire, and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law.",10
2013-01-30,oba,That’s common sense.,2
2013-01-30,oba,And that’s why we need comprehensive immigration reform.,3
2013-01-30,oba,There’s another economic reason why we need reform.,3
2013-01-30,oba,It’s not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy.,8
2013-01-30,oba,"It’s also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so, and the effect that has on our economy.",8
2013-01-30,oba,"Right now, there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities.",8
2013-01-30,oba,"They’re earning degrees in the fields of the future, like engineering and computer science.",6
2013-01-30,oba,"But once they finish school, once they earn that diploma, there’s a good chance they’ll have to leave our country.",5
2013-01-30,oba,Think about that.,2
2013-01-30,oba,Intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.,7
2013-01-30,oba,Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.,7
2013-01-30,oba,"Right now in one of those classrooms, there’s a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea -- their Intel or Instagram -- into a big business.",6
2013-01-30,oba,"We’re giving them all the skills they need to figure that out, but then we’re going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else?",10
2013-01-30,oba,That’s not how you grow new industries in America.,4
2013-01-30,oba,That’s how you give new industries to our competitors.,4
2013-01-30,oba,That’s why we need comprehensive immigration reform.,3
2013-01-30,oba,"Now, during my first term, we took steps to try and patch up some of the worst cracks in the system.",8
2013-01-30,oba,"First, we strengthened security at the borders so that we could finally stem the tide of illegal immigrants.",5
2013-01-30,oba,We put more boots on the ground on the southern border than at any time in our history.,7
2013-01-30,oba,"And today, illegal crossings are down nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000.",4
2013-01-30,oba,"Second, we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities.",7
2013-01-30,oba,"And today, deportations of criminals is at its highest level ever.",3
2013-01-30,oba,"And third, we took up the cause of the DREAMers -- the young people who were brought to this country as children, young people who have grown up here, built their lives here, have futures here.",11
2013-01-30,oba,"We said that if you’re able to meet some basic criteria like pursuing an education, then we’ll consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so that you can live here and work here legally, so that you can finally have the dignity of knowing you belong.",8
2013-01-30,oba,"But because this change isn’t permanent, we need Congress to act -- and not just on the DREAM Act.",3
2013-01-30,oba,We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now.,10
2013-01-30,oba,That's what we need.,2
2013-01-30,oba,"Now, the good news is that for the first time in many years, Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together.",6
2013-01-30,oba,"Members of both parties, in both chambers, are actively working on a solution.",4
2013-01-30,oba,"Yesterday, a bipartisan group of senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform, which are very much in line with the principles I’ve proposed and campaigned on for the last few years.",13
2013-01-30,oba,"So at this moment, it looks like there’s a genuine desire to get this done soon, and that’s very encouraging.",5
2013-01-30,oba,"But this time, action must follow.",2
2013-01-30,oba,We can't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate.,4
2013-01-30,oba,We've been debating this a very long time.,3
2013-01-30,oba,So it's not as if we don't know technically what needs to get done.,4
2013-01-30,oba,"As a consequence, to help move this process along, today I’m laying out my ideas for immigration reform.",4
2013-01-30,oba,"And my hope is that this provides some key markers to members of Congress as they craft a bill, because the ideas I’m proposing have traditionally been supported by both Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Republicans like President George W. Bush.",5
2013-01-30,oba,You don't get that matchup very often.,2
2013-01-30,oba,So we know where the consensus should be.,3
2013-01-30,oba,"Now, of course, there will be rigorous debate about many of the details, and every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process.",6
2013-01-30,oba,But it’s important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place.,6
2013-01-30,oba,"And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.",6
2013-01-30,oba,So the principles are pretty straightforward.,2
2013-01-30,oba,There are a lot of details behind it.,5
2013-01-30,oba,We're going to hand out a bunch of paper so that everybody will know exactly what we're talking about.,6
2013-01-30,oba,But the principles are pretty straightforward.,2
2013-01-30,oba,"First, I believe we need to stay focused on enforcement.",5
2013-01-30,oba,That means continuing to strengthen security at our borders.,5
2013-01-30,oba,It means cracking down more forcefully on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers.,6
2013-01-30,oba,"To be fair, most businesses want to do the right thing, but a lot of them have a hard time figuring out who’s here legally, who’s not.",5
2013-01-30,oba,So we need to implement a national system that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify someone’s employment status.,7
2013-01-30,oba,"And if they still knowingly hire undocumented workers, then we need to ramp up the penalties.",3
2013-01-30,oba,"Second, we have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally.",5
2013-01-30,oba,We all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship.,5
2013-01-30,oba,"But for comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship.",7
2013-01-30,oba,"We’ve got to lay out a path -- a process that includes passing a background check, paying taxes, paying a penalty, learning English, and then going to the back of the line, behind all the folks who are trying to come here legally.",9
2013-01-30,oba,"That's only fair, right?",3
2013-01-30,oba,So that means it won’t be a quick process but it will be a fair process.,4
2013-01-30,oba,And it will lift these individuals out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn their way to a green card and eventually to citizenship.,6
2013-01-30,oba,And the third principle is we’ve got to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no longer reflects the realities of our time.,7
2013-01-30,oba,"For example, if you are a citizen, you shouldn’t have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America.",6
2013-01-30,oba,You shouldn't have to wait years.,2
2013-01-30,oba,"If you’re a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology, or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors, we should help you do that here.",13
2013-01-30,oba,"Because if you succeed, you’ll create American businesses and American jobs.",3
2013-01-30,oba,You’ll help us grow our economy.,3
2013-01-30,oba,You’ll help us strengthen our middle class.,3
2013-01-30,oba,So that’s what comprehensive immigration reform looks like:  smarter enforcement; a pathway to earned citizenship; improvements in the legal immigration system so that we continue to be a magnet for the best and the brightest all around the world.,12
2013-01-30,oba,It’s pretty straightforward.,2
2013-01-30,oba,"The question now is simple:  Do we have the resolve as a people, as a country, as a government to finally put this issue behind us?",4
2013-01-30,oba,I believe that we do.,2
2013-01-30,oba,I believe that we do.,2
2013-01-30,oba,I believe we are finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform is within our grasp.,7
2013-01-30,oba,"But I promise you this:  The closer we get, the more emotional this debate is going to become.",5
2013-01-30,oba,Immigration has always been an issue that enflames passions.,3
2013-01-30,oba,That’s not surprising.,2
2013-01-30,oba,There are few things that are more important to us as a society than who gets to come here and call our country home; who gets the privilege of becoming a citizen of the United States of America.,10
2013-01-30,oba,That's a big deal.,2
2013-01-30,oba,"When we talk about that in the abstract, it’s easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of “us” versus “them.”  And when that happens, a lot of folks forget that most of “us” used to be “them.”  We forget that.",5
2013-01-30,oba,It’s really important for us to remember our history.,3
2013-01-30,oba,"Unless you’re one of the first Americans, a Native American, you came from someplace else.",6
2013-01-30,oba,Somebody brought you.,1
2013-01-30,oba,"Ken Salazar, he’s of Mexican American descent, but he points that his family has been living where he lives for 400 years, so he didn't immigrate anywhere.",6
2013-01-30,oba,The Irish who left behind a land of famine.,4
2013-01-30,oba,The Germans who fled persecution.,2
2013-01-30,oba,The Scandinavians who arrived eager to pioneer out west.,4
2013-01-30,oba,The Polish.,1
2013-01-30,oba,The Russians.,1

2013-01-30,oba,They faced hardship.,1
2013-01-30,oba,They faced racism.,1
2013-01-30,oba,They faced ridicule.,1
2013-01-30,oba,"But over time, as they went about their daily lives, as they earned a living, as they raised a family, as they built a community, as their kids went to school here, they did their part to build a nation.",4
2013-01-30,oba,They were the Einsteins and the Carnegies.,3
2013-01-30,oba,"But they were also the millions of women and men whose names history may not remember, but whose actions helped make us who we are; who built this country hand by hand, brick by brick.",8
2013-01-30,oba,"They all came here knowing that what makes somebody an American is not just blood or birth, but allegiance to our founding principles and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of our story.",13
2013-01-30,oba,And that’s still true today.,1
2013-01-30,oba,Just ask Alan Aleman.,2
2013-01-30,oba,Alan is here this afternoon -- where is Alan?,2
2013-01-30,oba,He's around here -- there he is right here.,3
2013-01-30,oba,Alan was born in Mexico.,2
2013-01-30,oba,He was brought to this country by his parents when he was a child.,3
2013-01-30,oba,"Growing up, Alan went to an American school, pledged allegiance to the American flag, felt American in every way -- and he was, except for one:  on paper.",7
2013-01-30,oba,"In high school, Alan watched his friends come of age -- driving around town with their new licenses, earning some extra cash from their summer jobs at the mall.",8
2013-01-30,oba,He knew he couldn’t do those things.,3
2013-01-30,oba,But it didn’t matter that much.,2
2013-01-30,oba,What mattered to Alan was earning an education so that he could live up to his God-given potential.,5
2013-01-30,oba,"Last year, when Alan heard the news that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows -- even if it's just for two years at a time -- he was one of the first to sign up.",9
2013-01-30,oba,And a few months ago he was one of the first people in Nevada to get approved.,5
2013-01-30,oba,"In that moment, Alan said, “I felt the fear vanish.",4
2013-01-30,oba,"I felt accepted.” So today, Alan is in his second year at the College of Southern Nevada.",2
2013-01-30,oba,Alan is studying to become a doctor.,3
2013-01-30,oba,He hopes to join the Air Force.,3
2013-01-30,oba,He’s working hard every single day to build a better life for himself and his family.,5
2013-01-30,oba,And all he wants is the opportunity to do his part to build a better America.,6
2013-01-30,oba,"So in the coming weeks, as the idea of reform becomes more real and the debate becomes more heated, and there are folks who are trying to pull this thing apart, remember Alan and all those who share the same hopes and the same dreams.",8
2013-01-30,oba,Remember that this is not just a debate about policy.,4
2013-01-30,oba,It’s about people.,2
2013-01-30,oba,It’s about men and women and young people who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story.,11
2013-01-30,oba,"Throughout our history, that has only made our nation stronger.",3
2013-01-30,oba,"And it’s how we will make sure that this century is the same as the last:  an American century welcoming of everybody who aspires to do something more, and who is willing to work hard to do it, and is willing to pledge that allegiance to our flag.",13
2013-01-30,oba,Thank you.,1
2013-01-30,oba,God bless you.,1
2013-01-30,oba,And God bless the United States of America.,3
2013-02-13,oba,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, fellow citizens: Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this chamber that “the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress.”  “It is my task,” he said, “to report the State of the Union -- to improve it is the task of us all.” Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report.",7
2013-02-13,oba,"After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs.",5

2013-02-13,oba,"Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"So, together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger.",8
2013-02-13,oba,But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded.,6
2013-02-13,oba,Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many people still can’t find full-time employment.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs -- but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"It is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, or who you love.",8
2013-02-13,oba,"It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation.",10
2013-02-13,oba,The American people don’t expect government to solve every problem.,3
2013-02-13,oba,They don’t expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue.,5
2013-02-13,oba,But they do expect us to put the nation’s interests before party.,4
2013-02-13,oba,They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together, and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.",7
2013-02-13,oba,Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget -- decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.,13
2013-02-13,oba,"Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.",10
2013-02-13,oba,Now we need to finish the job.,3
2013-02-13,oba,"And the question is, how?",2
2013-02-13,oba,"In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn’t agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars’ worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.",13
2013-02-13,oba,"These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.",2
2013-02-13,oba,"They’d devastate priorities like education, and energy, and medical research.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"That’s why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as the sequester, are a really bad idea.",7
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare and Social Security benefits.",12
2013-02-13,oba,That idea is even worse.,2
2013-02-13,oba,"Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.",7
2013-02-13,oba,But we can’t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.,6
2013-02-13,oba,"We won’t grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters.",8
2013-02-13,oba,"Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- understand that we can’t just cut our way to prosperity.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share.",6
2013-02-13,oba,And that’s the approach I offer tonight.,3
2013-02-13,oba,"On Medicare, I’m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.",11
2013-02-13,oba,"Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.",6
2013-02-13,oba,And the reforms I’m proposing go even further.,4
2013-02-13,oba,We’ll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.,5
2013-02-13,oba,"We’ll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn’t be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.",11
2013-02-13,oba,"And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don’t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement.",6
2013-02-13,oba,Our government shouldn’t make promises we cannot keep -- but we must keep the promises we’ve already made.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and the well-connected.",7
2013-02-13,oba,"After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks?",5
2013-02-13,oba,How is that fair?,2
2013-02-13,oba,Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing some loopholes?,9
2013-02-13,oba,How does that promote growth?,1
2013-02-13,oba,"Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.",8
2013-02-13,oba,We can get this done.,2
2013-02-13,oba,"The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring -- a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can’t work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America.",11
2013-02-13,oba,That’s what tax reform can deliver.,3
2013-02-13,oba,That’s what we can do together.,2
2013-02-13,oba,I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy.,4
2013-02-13,oba,The politics will be hard for both sides.,3
2013-02-13,oba,None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans.",7
2013-02-13,oba,So let’s set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.,10
2013-02-13,oba,And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors.,6
2013-02-13,oba,The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.,6
2013-02-13,oba,We can't do it.,1
2013-02-13,oba,"Let’s agree right here, right now to keep the people’s government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.",8
2013-02-13,oba,"The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"But let’s be clear, deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.",3
2013-02-13,oba,"A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs -- that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation:  How do we attract more jobs to our shores?",4
2013-02-13,oba,How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs?,6
2013-02-13,oba,And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?,5
2013-02-13,oba,"A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs.",6
2013-02-13,oba,And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda.,6
2013-02-13,oba,I urge this Congress to pass the rest.,3
2013-02-13,oba,"But tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago.",7
2013-02-13,oba,Let me repeat -- nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"It is not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.",6
2013-02-13,oba,That's what we should be looking for.,3
2013-02-13,oba,Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three.",6
2013-02-13,oba,Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan.,3
2013-02-13,oba,Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico.,3
2013-02-13,oba,"And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.",3
2013-02-13,oba,"There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend.",3
2013-02-13,oba,"Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio.",4
2013-02-13,oba,A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.,10
2013-02-13,oba,There’s no reason this can’t happen in other towns.,5
2013-02-13,oba,"So tonight, I’m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs.",17
2013-02-13,oba,And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America.,8
2013-02-13,oba,We can get that done.,2
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas.",4
2013-02-13,oba,Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy -- every dollar.,5
2013-02-13,oba,"Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s.",3
2013-02-13,oba,They’re developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful.,5
2013-02-13,oba,Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation.,6
2013-02-13,oba,Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race.,9
2013-02-13,oba,We need to make those investments.,3
2013-02-13,oba,"Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"After years of talking about it, we’re finally poised to control our own energy future.",6
2013-02-13,oba,We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar -- with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it.",7
2013-02-13,oba,We produce more natural gas than ever before -- and nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, it’s true that no single event makes a trend.",3
2013-02-13,oba,But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods -- all are now more frequent and more intense.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence.",5
2013-02-13,oba,Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it’s too late.,5
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it.",5
2013-02-13,oba,And we’ve begun to change that.,2
2013-02-13,oba,"Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America.",5
2013-02-13,oba,So let’s generate even more.,3
2013-02-13,oba,Solar energy gets cheaper by the year -- let’s drive down costs even further.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy, so must we.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence.",4
2013-02-13,oba,We need to encourage that.,2
2013-02-13,oba,And that’s why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits.,6
2013-02-13,oba,That’s got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan.,8
2013-02-13,oba,But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water.,8
2013-02-13,oba,"In fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.",7
2013-02-13,oba,"If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we.",6
2013-02-13,oba,Let’s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we’ve put up with for far too long.,8
2013-02-13,oba,I’m also issuing a new goal for America:  Let’s cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years.,7
2013-02-13,oba,We'll work with the states to do it.,3
2013-02-13,oba,Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen.,7
2013-02-13,oba,America’s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair.,5
2013-02-13,oba,"Ask any CEO where they’d rather locate and hire -- a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and Internet; high-tech schools, self-healing power grids.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina -- said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they’ll bring even more jobs.",7
2013-02-13,oba,And that’s the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world.,8
2013-02-13,oba,And I know you want these job-creating projects in your district.,5
2013-02-13,oba,I’ve seen all those ribbon-cuttings.,2
2013-02-13,oba,"So tonight, I propose a “Fix-It-First” program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country.",7
2013-02-13,oba,"And to make sure taxpayers don’t shoulder the whole burden, I’m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most:  modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"Let’s prove that there’s no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and let’s start right away.",8
2013-02-13,oba,We can get this done.,2
2013-02-13,oba,And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector.,4
2013-02-13,oba,The good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007.,5
2013-02-13,oba,Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years.,5
2013-02-13,oba,"Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected.",7
2013-02-13,oba,Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no.,5
2013-02-13,oba,That’s holding our entire economy back.,2
2013-02-13,oba,We need to fix it.,2
2013-02-13,oba,"Right now, there’s a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today’s rates.",10
2013-02-13,oba,"Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for?",3
2013-02-13,oba,"Take a vote, and send me that bill.",3
2013-02-13,oba,Why would we be against that?,2
2013-02-13,oba,"Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance?",3
2013-02-13,oba,"Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home.",4
2013-02-13,oba,What’s holding us back?,1
2013-02-13,oba,"Let’s streamline the process, and help our economy grow.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing -- all these things will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs.",6
2013-02-13,oba,But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs.,4
2013-02-13,oba,And that has to start at the earliest possible age.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program.",5
2013-02-13,oba,Most middle-class parents can’t afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool.,3
2013-02-13,oba,"And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"So tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America.",8
2013-02-13,oba,That's something we should be able to do.,5
2013-02-13,oba,"Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than seven dollars later on -- by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime.",6
2013-02-13,oba,"In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own.",10
2013-02-13,oba,We know this works.,2
2013-02-13,oba,So let’s do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind.,8
2013-02-13,oba,Let’s give our kids that chance.,3
2013-02-13,oba,Let’s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job.,8
2013-02-13,oba,"Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges.",9

2013-02-13,oba,We need to give every American student opportunities like this.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"And four years ago, we started Race to the Top -- a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year.",7
2013-02-13,oba,"Tonight, I’m announcing a new challenge to redesign America’s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy.",8
2013-02-13,oba,"And we’ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering and math -- the skills today’s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future.",14
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education.",3
2013-02-13,oba,"It’s a simple fact the more education you’ve got, the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"Through tax credits, grants and better loans, we’ve made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years.",5
2013-02-13,oba,But taxpayers can’t keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education.,5
2013-02-13,oba,"Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it’s our job to make sure that they do.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"So tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid.",9
2013-02-13,oba,"And tomorrow, my administration will release a new “College Scorecard” that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria -- where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.",12
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today’s jobs require.",8
2013-02-13,oba,But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who’s willing to work -- everybody who’s willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead.,11
2013-02-13,oba,"Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants.",5

2013-02-13,oba,"Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship -- a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.",10
2013-02-13,oba,And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy.,9
2013-02-13,oba,"In other words, we know what needs to be done.",3
2013-02-13,oba,"And as we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts.",4

2013-02-13,oba,"And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year.",7
2013-02-13,oba,We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day’s work with honest wages.,6
2013-02-13,oba,"But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"Even with the tax relief we put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line.",6
2013-02-13,oba,That’s wrong.,1
2013-02-13,oba,"That’s why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"Tonight, let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.",10
2013-02-13,oba,We should be able to get that done.,4
2013-02-13,oba,This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families.,6
2013-02-13,oba,It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead.,5
2013-02-13,oba,"For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets.",6
2013-02-13,oba,And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government.,3
2013-02-13,oba,"In fact, working folks shouldn’t have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"So here’s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year -- let’s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.",7
2013-02-13,oba,"Tonight, let’s also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead.",8
2013-02-13,oba,Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up.,6
2013-02-13,oba,"Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job.",4
2013-02-13,oba,America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny.,6
2013-02-13,oba,And that’s why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.,8
2013-02-13,oba,"Let’s offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore.",9

2013-02-13,oba,We’ll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"And we’ll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and do more to encourage fatherhood -- because what makes you a man isn’t the ability to conceive a child; it’s having the courage to raise one.",9

2013-02-13,oba,We want to help that.,2

2013-02-13,oba,"Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"It's true, different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa.",4
2013-02-13,oba,The threat these groups pose is evolving.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"But to meet this threat, we don’t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations.",5
2013-02-13,oba,"Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen, and Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali.",7
2013-02-13,oba,"And where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.",8
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight.",4
2013-02-13,oba,That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts.,6

2013-02-13,oba,"I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word for it that we’re doing things the right way.",4
2013-02-13,oba,"So in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.",10
2013-02-13,oba,"Of course, our challenges don’t end with al Qaeda.",3

2013-02-13,oba,"Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon.",7
2013-02-13,oba,"At the same time, we’ll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands -- because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations.",9
2013-02-13,oba,America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks.,4
2013-02-13,oba,"Now, we know hackers steal people’s identities and infiltrate private emails.",4

2013-02-13,oba,We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.,7

2013-02-13,oba,"But now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.",8

2013-04-16,oba,And we will find out who did this; we'll find out why they did this.,3
2013-04-16,oba,"Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.",3
2013-04-16,oba,Today is a holiday in Massachusetts -- Patriots’ Day.,3
2013-04-16,oba,It’s a day that celebrates the free and fiercely independent spirit that this great American city of Boston has reflected from the  earliest days of our nation.,9
2013-04-16,oba,And it’s a day that draws the world to Boston’s streets in a spirit of friendly competition.,7
2013-04-16,oba,Boston is a tough and resilient town.,3
2013-04-16,oba,So are its people.,2
2013-04-16,oba,"I'm supremely confident that Bostonians will pull together, take care of each other, and move forward as one proud city.",7
2013-04-16,oba,"And as they do, the American people will be with them every single step of the way.",4
2013-04-16,oba,"You should anticipate that as we get more information, our teams will provide you briefings.",4
2013-04-16,oba,We're still in the investigation stage at this point.,3
2013-04-16,oba,But I just want to reiterate we will find out who did this and we will hold them accountable.,4
2013-04-16,oba,Thank you very much.,2
2013-04-16,oba,1,0
2013-04-26,oba,To President and Mrs. Bush; to President Clinton and now-former Secretary Clinton; to President George H.W.,6
2013-04-26,oba,Bush and Mrs. Bush; to President and Mrs. Carter; to current and former world leaders and all the distinguished guests here today: Michelle and I are honored to be with you to mark this historic occasion.,5
2013-04-26,oba,This is a Texas-sized party.,3
2013-04-26,oba,"And that’s worthy of what we’re here to do today: honor the life and legacy of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush.",6
2013-04-26,oba,"When all the living former Presidents are together, it’s also a -- a special day for our democracy.",5
2013-04-26,oba,"We’ve been called ""the world’s most exclusive club"" -- and we do have a pretty nice clubhouse.",4
2013-04-26,oba,"But the truth is, our club is more like a support group.",4
2013-04-26,oba,The last time we all got together was just before I took office -- and I needed that.,4
2013-04-26,oba,"Because as each of these leaders will tell you, no matter how much you may think you’re ready to assume the office of the presidency, it’s impossible to truly understand the nature of the job until it’s yours, until you’re sitting at that desk.",9
2013-04-26,oba,And that’s why every President gains a greater appreciation for all of those who served before them; for the leaders from both parties who've taken on the momentous challenges and felt the enormous weight of the nation on their shoulders.,9
2013-04-26,oba,"And for me, that appreciation very much extends to President Bush.",3
2013-04-26,oba,"The first thing I found in that desk the day I took office was a -- a letter from George, and one that demonstrated his compassion and his generosity.",6
2013-04-26,oba,"For he knew that I would come to learn what he had learned -- that being President, above all, is a humbling job.",5
2013-04-26,oba,There are moments where you make mistakes.,3
2013-04-26,oba,There are times where you wish you could turn back the clock.,5
2013-04-26,oba,"And what I know is true about President Bush, and I hope my successor will say about me, is that we love this country and we do our best.",5
2013-04-26,oba,"Now, in the past, President Bush has said it’s impossible to pass judgment on his presidency while he’s still alive.",5
2013-04-26,oba,So maybe this is a little bit premature.,3
2013-04-26,oba,"But even now, there are certain things that we know for certain.",4
2013-04-26,oba,"We know about the son who was raised by two strong, loving parents in Midland, famous -- famously inheriting, as he says, ""my daddy’s eyes and my mother’s mouth""; the young boy who once came home after a trip to a museum and proudly presented his horrified mother with a small dinosaur tailbone he had smuggled home in his pocket.",10
2013-04-26,oba,I’ll bet that went over great with Barbara.,3
2013-04-26,oba,"We know about the young man who met the love of his life at a dinner party, ditching his plans to go to bed early and instead talking with the brilliant and charming Laura Welch late into the night.",8
2013-04-26,oba,"We know about the father who raised two remarkable, caring, beautiful daughters, even after they tried to discourage him from running for President, saying, ""Dad, you’re not as cool as you think you are.""",7
2013-04-26,oba,"Mr. President, I can relate.",2
2013-04-26,oba,"And now we see President Bush, the grandfather, just beginning to spoil his brand-new granddaughter.",5
2013-04-26,oba,So we know President Bush the man.,3
2013-04-26,oba,"And what President Clinton said is absolutely true -- to know the man is to like the man, because he’s comfortable in his own skin.",5
2013-04-26,oba,He knows who he is.,2
2013-04-26,oba,He doesn’t put on any pretenses.,3
2013-04-26,oba,"He takes his job seriously, but he doesn’t take himself too seriously.",3
2013-04-26,oba,He is a good man.,2
2013-04-26,oba,But we also know something about George Bush the leader.,5
2013-04-26,oba,"As we walk through this library, obviously we’re reminded of the incredible strength and resolve that came through that bullhorn as he stood amid the rubble and the ruins of Ground Zero, promising to deliver justice to those who had sought to destroy our way of life.",13
2013-04-26,oba,"We remember the compassion that he showed by leading the global fight against HIV/AIDS and malaria, helping to save millions of lives and reminding people in some of the poorest corners of the globe that America cares and that we’re here to help.",17
2013-04-26,oba,"We remember his commitment to reaching across the aisle to unlikely allies like Ted Kennedy, because he believed that we had to reform our schools in ways that help every child learn, not just some; that we have to repair a broken immigration system; and that this progress is only possible when we do it together.",10
2013-04-26,oba,"Seven years ago, President Bush restarted an important conversation by speaking with the American people about our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.",9
2013-04-26,oba,"And even though comprehensive immigration reform has taken a little longer than any of us expected, I am hopeful that this year, with the help of Speaker Boehner and some of the senators and members of Congress who are here today, that we bring it home -- for our families, and our economy, and our security, and for this incredible country that we love.",12
2013-04-26,oba,"And if we do that, it will be in large part thanks to all the hard work of President George W. Bush.",6
2013-04-26,oba,"And finally, a President bears no greater decision and no more solemn burden than serving as Commander-in-Chief of the greatest military that the world has ever known.",11
2013-04-26,oba,"As President Bush himself has said, ""America must and will keep its word to the men and women who have given us so much.""",6
2013-04-26,oba,"So even as we Americans may at times disagree on matters of foreign policy, we share a profound respect and reverence for the men and women of our military and their families.",7
2013-04-26,oba,And we are united in our determination to comfort the families of the fallen and to care for those who wear the uniform of the United States.,11
2013-04-26,oba,"On the flight back from Russia, after negotiating with Nikita Khrushchev at the height of the Cold War, President Kennedy's secretary found a small slip of paper on which the President had written a favorite saying: ""I know there is a God.",9
2013-04-26,oba,And I see a storm coming.,3
2013-04-26,oba,"If he has a place for me, I believe I am ready.""",4
2013-04-26,oba,No one can be completely ready for this office.,4
2013-04-26,oba,"But America needs leaders who are willing to face the storm head on, even as they pray for God's strength and wisdom so that they can do what they believe is right.",7
2013-04-26,oba,And that’s what the leaders with whom I share this stage have all done.,5
2013-04-26,oba,That’s what President George W. Bush chose to do.,3
2013-04-26,oba,That’s why I'm honored to be part of today's celebration.,7
2013-04-26,oba,"Mr. President, for your service, for your courage, for your sense of humor, and, most of all, for your love of country: Thank you very much.",10
2013-04-26,oba,"From all the citizens of the United States of America, God bless you.",6
2013-04-26,oba,And God bless these United States.,2
2013-05-04,oba, Hola!,1
2013-05-04,oba,Buenos dias!,1
2013-05-04,oba,"Please, please, everybody have a seat.",2
2013-05-04,oba,"It is wonderful to be back in México -- lindo y querido [""lovely and beloved""].",4
2013-05-04,oba,"I bring with me the greetings and friendship of the people of the United States, including tens of millions of proud Mexican Americans.",6
2013-05-04,oba,This is my fourth visit to Mexico as President.,3
2013-05-04,oba,This is my second visit to this museum.,4
2013-05-04,oba,"And each time that I've come I’ve been inspired by your culture and by the beauty of this land, and most of all, by the Mexican people.",6
2013-05-04,oba,You’ve been so kind and gracious to me.,4
2013-05-04,oba,"You’ve welcomed my wife, Michelle, here.",2
2013-05-04,oba,"You’ve welcomed our daughter, Malia, and her classmates to Oaxaca.",4
2013-05-04,oba,"And as a proud father, I have to say that Malia’s Spanish is getting very good.",5
2013-05-04,oba,It helps that she’s smarter than I am.,4
2013-05-04,oba,And it’s an honor to be back in Mexico City -- one of the world’s great cities.,6
2013-05-04,oba,Es un placer estar entre amigos.,2
2013-05-04,oba,"And it’s fitting that we gather at this great museum, which celebrates Mexico’s ancient civilizations and their achievements in arts and architecture, medicine and mathematics.",11
2013-05-04,oba,"In modern times, Mexico’s blend of cultures and traditions found its expression in the murals of Rivera and the paintings of Frida, and the poetry of Sor Juana and the essays of Octavio Paz.",8
2013-05-04,oba,"And Paz once spoke words that capture the spirit of our gathering here today -- in this place that celebrates your past, but which this morning is filled with so many young people who will shape Mexico’s future.",7
2013-05-04,oba,"Octavio Paz said,

    Modernity is not outside us, it is within us.",4
2013-05-04,oba,It is today and the most ancient antiquity; it is tomorrow and the beginning of the world; it is a thousand years old and yet newborn.,6
2013-05-04,oba,"And that’s why I wanted this opportunity to speak with all of you today, because you live at the intersection of history that Octavio Paz was referring to.",7
2013-05-04,oba,"The young people of Mexico, you honor your heritage, thousands of years old, but you’re also part of something new, a nation that’s in the process of remaking itself.",11
2013-05-04,oba,"And as our modern world changes around us, it’s the spirit of young people, your optimism and your idealism, and your willingness to discard old habits that are no longer working that will drive the world forward.",10
2013-05-04,oba,You see the difference between the world as it is and the world as it could to be; between old attitudes that stifle progress and the new thinking that allows us to connect and collaborate across cultures.,10
2013-05-04,oba,"And by the way, that includes how we think about the relationship between Mexico and the United States.",7
2013-05-04,oba,"Despite all the bonds and the values that we share, despite all the people who claim heritage on both sides, our attitudes sometimes are trapped in old stereotypes.",6
2013-05-04,oba,Some Americans only see the Mexico that is depicted in sensational headlines of violence and border crossings.,8
2013-05-04,oba,"And let’s admit it, some Mexicans think that America disrespects Mexico, or thinks that America is trying to impose itself on Mexican sovereignty, or just wants to wall ourselves off.",7
2013-05-04,oba,And in both countries such distortions create misunderstandings that make it harder for us to move forward together.,5
2013-05-04,oba,So I've come to Mexico because I think it’s time for us to put the old mind-sets aside.,5
2013-05-04,oba,It’s time to recognize new realities -- including the impressive progress of today’s Mexico.,9
2013-05-04,oba,"It is true that there are Mexicans all across this country who are making courageous sacrifices for the security of your country; that in the countryside and the neighborhoods not far from here, there are those who are still struggling to give their children a better life.",9
2013-05-04,oba,But what’s also clear is that a new Mexico is emerging.,3
2013-05-04,oba,"I see it in the deepening of Mexico’s democracy, citizens who are standing up and saying that violence and impunity is not acceptable; a courageous press that’s working to hold leaders accountable; a robust civil society, including brave defenders of human rights who demand dignity and rule of law.",8
2013-05-04,oba,"You have political parties that are competing vigorously, but also transferring power peacefully, and forging compromise.",5
2013-05-04,oba,And that's all a sign of the extraordinary progress that's taken place here in Mexico.,7
2013-05-04,oba,"And even though we know the work of perfecting democracy is never finished -- that's true in America, that's true here in Mexico -- you go forward knowing the truth that Benito Juarez once spoke -- “democracy is the destiny of humanity.”  And we are seeing that here in Mexico.",9
2013-05-04,oba,We're seeing that here in Mexico.,3
2013-05-04,oba,We're also seeing a Mexico that’s creating new prosperity:  Trading with the world.,5
2013-05-04,oba,"Becoming a manufacturing powerhouse -- from Tijuana to Monterrey to Guadalajara and across the central highlands -- a global leader in automobiles and appliances and electronics, but also a center of high-tech innovation, producing the software and the hardware of our digital age.",7
2013-05-04,oba,One man in Querétaro spoke for an increasing number of Mexicans.,4
2013-05-04,oba,“There’s no reason to go abroad in search of a better life.,7
2013-05-04,oba,"There are good opportunities here.”  That's what he said, and you are an example of that.",2
2013-05-04,oba,"And, in fact, I see a Mexico that’s lifted millions of people from poverty.",5
2013-05-04,oba,"Because of the sacrifices of generations, a majority of Mexicans now call themselves middle class, with a quality of life that your parents and grandparents could only dream of.",5
2013-05-04,oba,"This includes, by the way, opportunities for women, who are proving that when you give women a chance, they will shape our destiny just as well as men, if not better.",8
2013-05-04,oba,I also see in Mexico’s youth an empowered generation because of technology.,4
2013-05-04,oba,I think I see some of you tweeting right now -- what’s happening.,6
2013-05-04,oba,"And whether it’s harnessing social media to preserve indigenous languages, or speaking up for the future that you want, you’re making it clear that you want your voice heard.",6
2013-05-04,oba,"And because of all the dynamic progress that's taking place here in Mexico, Mexico is also taking its rightful place in the world, on the world stage.",7
2013-05-04,oba,Mexico is standing up for democracy not just here in Mexico but throughout the hemisphere.,3
2013-05-04,oba,Mexico is sharing expertise with neighbors across the Americas.,5
2013-05-04,oba,"When they face earthquakes or threats to their citizens, or go to the polls to cast their votes, Mexico is there, helping its neighbors.",5
2013-05-04,oba,Mexico has joined the ranks of the world’s largest economies.,5
2013-05-04,oba,It became the first Latin American nation to host the G20.,4
2013-05-04,oba,"Just as Mexico is being transformed, so are the ties between our two countries.",4
2013-05-04,oba,"As President, I’ve been guided by a basic proposition -- in this relationship there’s no senior partner or junior partner; we are two equal partners, two sovereign nations.",5
2013-05-04,oba,We must work together in mutual interest and mutual respect.,4
2013-05-04,oba,And if we do that both Mexico and the United States will prosper.,3
2013-05-04,oba,"And just as I worked with President Calderón, I’ve reaffirmed with President Peña Nieto that the great partnership between our two countries will not simply continue, it’s going to grow stronger and become broader.",6
2013-05-04,oba,"In my time with President Peña Nieto, I’ve come to see his deep commitment to Mexico and its future.",6
2013-05-04,oba,And we share the belief that as leaders our guiding mission is to improve the lives of our people.,7
2013-05-04,oba,And so we agree that the relationship between our nations must be defined not by the threats that we face but by the prosperity and the opportunity that we can create together.,7
2013-05-04,oba,"Now, as equal partners, both our nations must recognize our mutual responsibilities.",3
2013-05-04,oba,"So here in Mexico, you’ve embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to make your economy more competitive and your institutions more accountable to you, the Mexican people.",5
2013-05-04,oba,"As you pursue these reforms, I want you to know that you have strong support in the United States.",6
2013-05-04,oba,"Because we believe, I believe, that people all around the world deserve the best from their government.",4
2013-05-04,oba,"And whether you’re looking for basic services, or trying to start a new business, we share your belief that you should be able to make it through your day without paying a bribe.",8
2013-05-04,oba,"And when talented Mexicans like you imagine your future, you should have every opportunity to succeed right here in the country you love.",6
2013-05-04,oba,"And in the United States, we recognize our responsibilities.",3
2013-05-04,oba,"We understand that much of the root cause of violence that's been happening here in Mexico, for which many so Mexicans have suffered, is the demand for illegal drugs in the United States.",12
2013-05-04,oba,And so we’ve got to continue to make progress on that front.,5
2013-05-04,oba,"I’ve been asked, and I honestly do not believe that legalizing drugs is the answer.",4
2013-05-04,oba,"But I do believe that a comprehensive approach -- not just law enforcement, but education and prevention and treatment -- that's what we have to do.",6
2013-05-04,oba,And we’re going to stay at it because the lives of our children and the future of our nations depend on it.,7
2013-05-04,oba,And we also recognize that most of the guns used to commit violence here in Mexico come from the United States.,5
2013-05-04,oba,"I think many of you know that in America, our Constitution guarantees our individual right to bear arms, and as President I swore an oath to uphold that right and I always will.",6
2013-05-04,oba,"But at the same time, as I’ve said in the United States, I will continue to do everything in my power to pass common-sense reforms that keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people.",12
2013-05-04,oba,That can save lives here in Mexico and back home in the United States.,4
2013-05-04,oba,It’s the right thing to do.,3
2013-05-04,oba,So we’ll keep increasing the pressure on gun traffickers who bring illegal guns into Mexico.,7
2013-05-04,oba,We’ll keep putting these criminals where they belong -- behind bars.,3
2013-05-04,oba,"We recognize we’ve got work to do on security issues, but we also recognize our responsibility -- as a nation that believes that all people are created equal -- we believe it’s our responsibility to make sure that we treat one another with dignity and respect.",9
2013-05-04,oba,And this includes recognizing how the United States has been strengthened by the extraordinary contributions of immigrants from Mexico and by Americans of Mexican heritage.,12
2013-05-04,oba,"Mexican Americans enrich our communities, including my hometown of Chicago, where you can walk through neighborhoods like Pilsen, Little Village -- La Villita -- dotted with murals of Mexican patriots.",13
2013-05-04,oba,"You can stop at a fonda, you can hear some mariachis, where we are inspired by the deep faith of our peoples at churches like Our Lady of Guadalupe.",8
2013-05-04,oba,We’ve got a Chicagoan in here somewhere.,3
2013-05-04,oba,"And we’re so grateful to Mexican Americans in every segment of our society -- for teaching our children, and running our companies, and serving with honor in our military, and making breakthroughs in science, standing up for social justice.",8
2013-05-04,oba,"As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. told Cesar Chavez once, we are “brothers in the fight for equality.”1  And, in fact, without the strong support of Latinos, including so many Mexican Americans, I would not be standing today as President of the United States.",5
2013-05-04,oba,That's the truth.,2
2013-05-04,oba,"And so given that is Americas heritage, given that we share a border with Mexico, given ties that run back generations, it is critical that the United States recognize the need to reform our immigration system -- because we are a nation of laws, but we're also a nation of immigrants.",8
2013-05-04,oba,Like every nation we have a responsibility to ensure that our laws are upheld.,5
2013-05-04,oba,"But we also know that, as a nation of immigrants, the immigration system we have in the United States right now doesn’t reflect our values.",6
2013-05-04,oba,It separates families when we should be reuniting them.,2
2013-05-04,oba,It’s led to millions of people to live in the shadows.,4
2013-05-04,oba,"It deprives us of the talents of so many young people -- even though we know that immigrants have always been the engine of our economy, starting some of our greatest companies and pioneering new industries.",7
2013-05-04,oba,That’s one of the reasons I acted to lift the shadow of deportation from what we call the DREAMers -- young people brought to the United States as children.,13
2013-05-04,oba,And that’s why I’m working with our Congress to pass common-sense immigration reform this year.,5
2013-05-04,oba,I'm convinced we can get it done.,4
2013-05-04,oba,"Reform that continues to strengthen border security and strengthen legal immigration, so citizens don’t have to wait years to bring their families to the United States.",6
2013-05-04,oba,Reform that holds everyone accountable -- so immigrants get on the right side of the law and so immigrants are not exploited and abused.,5
2013-05-04,oba,"And most of all, reform that gives millions of undocumented individuals a pathway to earn their citizenship.",5
2013-05-04,oba,And I’m optimistic that -- after years of trying -- we are going to get it done this year.,6
2013-05-04,oba,I'm absolutely convinced of it.,3
2013-05-04,oba,"Obviously, we’re going to have to work with the Mexican government to make sure that we've got a well-regulated border.",8
2013-05-04,oba,But I also want to work with the Mexican government because I believe that the long-term solution to the challenge of illegal immigration is a growing and prosperous Mexico that creates more jobs and opportunities for young people here.,8
2013-05-04,oba,"I agree with the Mexican student who said, “I feel like we can reach the same level as anyone in the world.”  That's absolutely true.",11
2013-05-04,oba,"And so I firmly believe -- juntos, podemos lograr más -- ""together, we can achieve more.""",3
2013-05-04,oba,"So with the remainder of my time today, I want to focus on five areas where we can do more.",5
2013-05-04,oba,"Number one, let’s do more to expand trade and commerce that creates good jobs for our people.",8
2013-05-04,oba,We already buy more of your exports than any country in the world.,8
2013-05-04,oba,"We sell more of our exports to Mexico than we do to Brazil, Russia, India and China combined.",7
2013-05-04,oba,"Mexican companies are investing more in the United States, and we’re the largest foreign investor in Mexico -- because we believe in Mexico and want to be a partner in your success.",8
2013-05-04,oba,"So guided by the new economic dialogue that President Peña Nieto and I announced yesterday, let’s do more to unlock the true potential of our relationship.",6
2013-05-04,oba,Let’s keep investing in our roads and our bridges and our border crossings so we can trade faster and cheaper.,7
2013-05-04,oba,"Let’s help our smaller businesses, which employ most of our workers, access new markets and new capital -- the big markets right across the border.",7
2013-05-04,oba,Let’s empower our young entrepreneurs as they create startup companies that can transform how we live.,6
2013-05-04,oba,"And let’s realize the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year, so our two nations can compete and win in the fast-growing markets of the Asia Pacific.",6
2013-05-04,oba,"If the United States and Mexico are working together, we can sell a whole lot of things on the other side of the Pacific Ocean where the fastest-growing economies are taking off right now.",6
2013-05-04,oba,That's number one.,2
2013-05-04,oba,"Number two, let’s not just sell more things to each other, let’s build more things together.",4
2013-05-04,oba,"With many of our companies operating in both countries, parts are now being shipped back and forth across the border as they’re assembled.",8
2013-05-04,oba,"So every day, U.S. and Mexican workers are building things together -- whether it’s crafts -- or whether it’s cars, or aircraft, or computers, or satellites.",6
2013-05-04,oba,I think this is only the beginning.,3
2013-05-04,oba,"Given the skills of our workers, it makes even more sense for companies around the world to set up shop in the United States and set up shop in Mexico.",6
2013-05-04,oba,"And as Mexico reforms, we’re going to be able to do more business together and sell more goods around the world.",8

2013-06-19,oba,And this history speaks to us today.,2
2013-06-19,oba,"Here, for thousands of years, the people of this land have journeyed from tribe to principality to nation-state; through Reformation and Enlightenment, renowned as a “land of poets and thinkers,” among them Immanuel Kant, who taught us that freedom is the “unoriginated birthright of man, and it belongs to him by force of his humanity.”
 
Here, for two centuries, this gate stood tall as the world around it convulsed -- through the rise and fall of empires; through revolutions and republics; art and music and science that reflected the height of human endeavor, but also war and carnage that exposed the depths of man’s cruelty to man.",8
2013-06-19,oba,It was here that Berliners carved out an island of democracy against the greatest of odds.,5
2013-06-19,oba,"As has already been mentioned, they were supported by an airlift of hope, and we are so honored to be joined by Colonel Halvorsen, 92 years old -- the original “candy bomber.”  We could not be prouder of him.",8
2013-06-19,oba,"I hope I look that good, by the way, when I'm 92.",5
2013-06-19,oba,"During that time, a Marshall Plan seeded a miracle, and a North Atlantic Alliance protected our people.",4
2013-06-19,oba,"And those in the neighborhoods and nations to the East drew strength from the knowledge that freedom was possible here, in Berlin -- that the waves of crackdowns and suppressions might therefore someday be overcome.",5
2013-06-19,oba,"Today, 60 years after they rose up against oppression, we remember the East German heroes of June 17th.",4
2013-06-19,oba,"When the wall finally came down, it was their dreams that were fulfilled.",3
2013-06-19,oba,"Their strength and their passion, their enduring example remind us that for all the power of militaries, for all the authority of governments, it is citizens who choose whether to be defined by a wall, or whether to tear it down.",7
2013-06-19,oba,And we’re now surrounded by the symbols of a Germany reborn.,5
2013-06-19,oba,A rebuilt Reichstag and its glistening glass dome.,2
2013-06-19,oba,An American embassy back at its historic home on Pariser Platz.,6
2013-06-19,oba,"And this square itself, once a desolate no man’s land, is now open to all.",4
2013-06-19,oba,"So while I am not the first American President to come to this gate, I am proud to stand on its Eastern side to pay tribute to the past.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"For throughout all this history, the fate of this city came down to a simple question:  Will we live free or in chains?",5
2013-06-19,oba,"Under governments that uphold our universal rights, or regimes that suppress them?",5
2013-06-19,oba,"In open societies that respect the sanctity of the individual and our free will, or in closed societies that suffocate the soul?",7
2013-06-19,oba,"As free peoples, we stated our convictions long ago.",3
2013-06-19,oba,"As Americans, we believe that “all men are created equal” with the right to life and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"And as Germans, you declared in your Basic Law that “the dignity of man is inviolable.”  Around the world, nations have pledged themselves to a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the inherent dignity and rights of all members of our human family.",4
2013-06-19,oba,And this is what was at stake here in Berlin all those years.,4
2013-06-19,oba,"And because courageous crowds climbed atop that wall, because corrupt dictatorships gave way to new democracies, because millions across this continent now breathe the fresh air of freedom, we can say, here in Berlin, here in Europe -- our values won.",6
2013-06-19,oba,Openness won.,1
2013-06-19,oba,Tolerance won.,1
2013-06-19,oba,And freedom won here in Berlin.,2
2013-06-19,oba,"And yet, more than two decades after that triumph, we must acknowledge that there can, at times, be a complacency among our Western democracies.",5
2013-06-19,oba,"Today, people often come together in places like this to remember history -- not to make it.",4
2013-06-19,oba,"After all, we face no concrete walls, no barbed wire.",3
2013-06-19,oba,There are no tanks poised across a border.,5
2013-06-19,oba,There are no visits to fallout shelters.,4
2013-06-19,oba,And so sometimes there can be a sense that the great challenges have somehow passed.,4
2013-06-19,oba,"And that brings with it a temptation to turn inward -- to think of our own pursuits, and not the sweep of history; to believe that we’ve settled history’s accounts, that we can simply enjoy the fruits won by our forebears.",7
2013-06-19,oba,"But I come here today, Berlin, to say complacency is not the character of great nations.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"Today’s threats are not as stark as they were half a century ago, but the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity -- that struggle goes on.",7
2013-06-19,oba,"And I’ve come here, to this city of hope, because the tests of our time demand the same fighting spirit that defined Berlin a half-century ago.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"Chancellor Merkel mentioned that we mark the anniversary of President John F. Kennedy’s stirring defense of freedom, embodied in the people of this great city.",8
2013-06-19,oba,His pledge of solidarity -- “Ich bin ein Berliner” -- echoes through the ages.,3
2013-06-19,oba,But that’s not all that he said that day.,4
2013-06-19,oba,"Less remembered is the challenge that he issued to the crowd before him:  “Let me ask you,” he said to those Berliners, “let me ask you to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today” and “beyond the freedom of merely this city.”  Look, he said, “to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.”
 
President Kennedy was taken from us less than six months after he spoke those words.",7
2013-06-19,oba,"And like so many who died in those decades of division, he did not live to see Berlin united and free.",7
2013-06-19,oba,"Instead, he lives forever as a young man in our memory.",5
2013-06-19,oba,"But his words are timeless because they call upon us to care more about things than just our own self-comfort, about our own city, about our own country.",7
2013-06-19,oba,They demand that we embrace the common endeavor of all humanity.,5
2013-06-19,oba,"And if we lift our eyes, as President Kennedy called us to do, then we’ll recognize that our work is not yet done.",4
2013-06-19,oba,For we are not only citizens of America or Germany -- we are also citizens of the world.,6
2013-06-19,oba,And our fates and fortunes are linked like never before.,2
2013-06-19,oba,"We may no longer live in fear of global annihilation, but so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe.",5
2013-06-19,oba,"We may strike blows against terrorist networks, but if we ignore the instability and intolerance that fuels extremism, our own freedom will eventually be endangered.",5
2013-06-19,oba,"We may enjoy a standard of living that is the envy of the world, but so long as hundreds of millions endure the agony of an empty stomach or the anguish of unemployment, we’re not truly prosperous.",8
2013-06-19,oba,"I say all this here, in the heart of Europe, because our shared past shows that none of these challenges can be met unless we see ourselves as part of something bigger than our own experience.",11
2013-06-19,oba,Our alliance is the foundation of global security.,4
2013-06-19,oba,Our trade and our commerce is the engine of our global economy.,4
2013-06-19,oba,Our values call upon us to care about the lives of people we will never meet.,5
2013-06-19,oba,"When Europe and America lead with our hopes instead of our fears, we do things that no other nations can do, no other nations will do.",7
2013-06-19,oba,So we have to lift up our eyes today and consider the day of peace with justice that our generation wants for this world.,7
2013-06-19,oba,"I'd suggest that peace with justice begins with the example we set here at home, for we know from our own histories that intolerance breeds injustice.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"Whether it's based on race, or religion, gender or sexual orientation, we are stronger when all our people -- no matter who they are or what they look like -- are granted opportunity, and when our wives and our daughters have the same opportunities as our husbands and our sons.",7
2013-06-19,oba,"When we respect the faiths practiced in our churches and synagogues, our mosques and our temples, we're more secure.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"When we welcome the immigrant with his talents or her dreams, we are renewed.",5
2013-06-19,oba,"When we stand up for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters and treat their love and their rights equally under the law, we defend our own liberty as well.",5
2013-06-19,oba,We are more free when all people can pursue their own happiness.,3
2013-06-19,oba,"And as long as walls exist in our hearts to separate us from those who don’t look like us, or think like us, or worship as we do, then we're going to have to work harder, together, to bring those walls of division down.",10
2013-06-19,oba,"Peace with justice means free enterprise that unleashes the talents and creativity that reside in each of us; in other models, direct economic growth from the top down or relies solely on the resources extracted from the earth.",9
2013-06-19,oba,But we believe that real prosperity comes from our most precious resource -- our people.,5
2013-06-19,oba,"And that’s why we choose to invest in education, and science and research.",4
2013-06-19,oba,"And now, as we emerge from recession, we must not avert our eyes from the insult of widening inequality, or the pain of youth who are unemployed.",5
2013-06-19,oba,We have to build new ladders of opportunity in our own societies that -- even as we pursue new trade and investment that fuels growth across the Atlantic.,6
2013-06-19,oba,America will stand with Europe as you strengthen your union.,3
2013-06-19,oba,"And we want to work with you to make sure that every person can enjoy the dignity that comes from work -- whether they live in Chicago or Cleveland or Belfast or Berlin, in Athens or Madrid, everybody deserves opportunity.",9
2013-06-19,oba,"We have to have economies that are working for all people, not just those at the very top.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"Peace with justice means extending a hand to those who reach for freedom, wherever they live.",7
2013-06-19,oba,"Different peoples and cultures will follow their own path, but we must reject the lie that those who live in distant places don’t yearn for freedom and self-determination just like we do; that they don’t somehow yearn for dignity and rule of law just like we do.",9
2013-06-19,oba,"We cannot dictate the pace of change in places like the Arab world, but we must reject the excuse that we can do nothing to support it.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"We cannot shrink from our role of advancing the values we believe in -- whether it's supporting Afghans as they take responsibility for their future, or working for an Israeli-Palestinian peace -- or engaging as we've done in Burma to help create space for brave people to emerge from decades of dictatorship.",12
2013-06-19,oba,"In this century, these are the citizens who long to join the free world.",5
2013-06-19,oba,They are who you were.,2
2013-06-19,oba,"They deserve our support, for they too, in their own way, are citizens of Berlin.",4
2013-06-19,oba,And we have to help them every day.,3
2013-06-19,oba,Peace with justice means pursuing the security of a world without nuclear weapons -- no matter how distant that dream may be.,5
2013-06-19,oba,"And so, as President, I've strengthened our efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and reduced the number and role of America’s nuclear weapons.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"Because of the New START Treaty, we’re on track to cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s.",5
2013-06-19,oba,But we have more work to do.,3
2013-06-19,oba,"So today, I’m announcing additional steps forward.",2
2013-06-19,oba,"After a comprehensive review, I’ve determined that we can ensure the security of America and our allies, and maintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent, while reducing our deployed strategic nuclear weapons by up to one-third.",7
2013-06-19,oba,And I intend to seek negotiated cuts with Russia to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures.,6
2013-06-19,oba,"At the same time, we’ll work with our NATO allies to seek bold reductions in U.S. and Russian tactical weapons in Europe.",6
2013-06-19,oba,"And we can forge a new international framework for peaceful nuclear power, and reject the nuclear weaponization that North Korea and Iran may be seeking.",5
2013-06-19,oba,"America will host a summit in 2016 to continue our efforts to secure nuclear materials around the world, and we will work to build support in the United States to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and call on all nations to begin negotiations on a treaty that ends the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons.",13
2013-06-19,oba,These are steps we can take to create a world of peace with justice.,8

2013-06-19,oba,This is the future we must avert.,3
2013-06-19,oba,This is the global threat of our time.,4
2013-06-19,oba,"And for the sake of future generations, our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate before it is too late.",5
2013-06-19,oba,That is our job.,2
2013-06-19,oba,That is our task.,2
2013-06-19,oba,We have to get to work.,3
2013-06-19,oba,Peace with justice means meeting our moral obligations.,3
2013-06-19,oba,And we have a moral obligation and a profound interest in helping lift the impoverished corners of the world.,9
2013-06-19,oba,By promoting growth so we spare a child born today a lifetime of extreme poverty.,6
2013-06-19,oba,"By investing in agriculture, so we aren’t just sending food, but also teaching farmers to grow food.",4
2013-06-19,oba,"By strengthening public health, so we’re not just sending medicine, but training doctors and nurses who will help end the outrage of children dying from preventable diseases.",11
2013-06-19,oba,Making sure that we do everything we can to realize the promise -- an achievable promise -- of the first AIDS-free generation.,7
2013-06-19,oba,That is something that is possible if we feel a sufficient sense of urgency.,4
2013-06-19,oba,Our efforts have to be about more than just charity.,5

2013-06-19,oba,"Because when they succeed, we will be more successful as well.",2
2013-06-19,oba,"Our fates are linked, and we cannot ignore those who are yearning not only for freedom but also prosperity.",7

2013-06-19,oba,"And I drew inspiration from one of our founding fathers, James Madison, who wrote, “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.”  James Madison is right -- which is why, even as we remain vigilant about the threat of terrorism, we must move beyond a mindset of perpetual war.",10
2013-06-19,oba,"And in America, that means redoubling our efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo.",5
2013-06-19,oba,It means tightly controlling our use of new technologies like drones.,6
2013-06-19,oba,It means balancing the pursuit of security with the protection of privacy.,8
2013-06-19,oba,And I'm confident that that balance can be struck.,4

Well, I wanted to come out here, first of all, to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session.",6
2013-07-14,oba,"The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks, there's going to obviously be a whole range of issues—immigration, economics, et cetera—we'll try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions.",12
2013-07-14,oba,"The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions, but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week: the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling.",10
2013-07-14,oba,I gave—in a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday.,4
2013-07-14,oba,"But watching the debate over the course of the last week, I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit.",7
2013-07-14,oba,"First of all, I want to make sure that, once again, I send my thoughts and prayers as well as Michelle's to the family of Trayvon Martin and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they've dealt with the entire situation.",10

2013-07-14,oba,"The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday, which is, there are going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case; I'll let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues.",14
2013-07-14,oba,The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner.,3
2013-07-14,oba,The prosecution and the defense made their arguments.,3
2013-07-14,oba,"The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this, reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict.",5
2013-07-14,oba,"And once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works.",3
2013-07-14,oba,But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling.,4
2013-07-14,oba,"When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son.",4
2013-07-14,oba,"Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.",5
2013-07-14,oba,"And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.",8
2013-07-14,oba,There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store.,9
2013-07-14,oba,That includes me.,1
2013-07-14,oba,There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars.,8
2013-07-14,oba,"That happens to me, at least before I was a Senator.",3
2013-07-14,oba,There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.,14
2013-07-14,oba,That happens often.,1
2013-07-14,oba,"And I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida.",5
2013-07-14,oba,And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.,3
2013-07-14,oba,"The African American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws, everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws.",10
2013-07-14,oba,And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case.,8
2013-07-14,oba,"Now, this isn't to say that the African American community is naive about the fact that African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, that they're disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence.",10
2013-07-14,oba,"It's not to make excuses for that fact, although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context.",5
2013-07-14,oba,They understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history.,10
2013-07-14,oba,And so the fact that sometimes that's unacknowledged adds to the frustration.,3
2013-07-14,oba,"And the fact that a lot of African American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given, ""Well, there are these statistics out there that show that African American boys are more violent.""",7
2013-07-14,oba,Using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain.,6
2013-07-14,oba,"I think the African American community is also not naive in understanding that, statistically, somebody like Trayvon Martin was statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else.",10
2013-07-14,oba,So folks understand the challenges that exist for African American boys.,5
2013-07-14,oba,"But they get frustrated, I think, if they feel that there's no context for it and that context is being denied.",5
2013-07-14,oba,"And that all contributes, I think, to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.",8
2013-07-14,oba,"Now, the question for me at least, and I think for a lot of folks, is where do we take this?",6
2013-07-14,oba,How do we learn some lessons from this and move in a positive direction?,4
2013-07-14,oba,"I think it's understandable that there have been demonstrations and vigils and protests, and some of that stuff is just going to have to work its way through, as long as it remains nonviolent.",9
2013-07-14,oba,"If I see any violence, then I will remind folks that that dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family.",6
2013-07-14,oba,"But beyond protests or vigils, the question is, are there some concrete things that we might be able to do?",6
2013-07-14,oba,"I know that Eric Holder is reviewing what happened down there, but I think it's important for people to have some clear expectations here.",5
2013-07-14,oba,"Traditionally, these are issues of State and local government, the criminal code.",5
2013-07-14,oba,"And law enforcement is traditionally done at the State and local levels, not at the Federal levels.",4
2013-07-14,oba,"That doesn't mean, though, that as a nation, we can't do some things that I think would be productive.",5
2013-07-14,oba,"So let me just give a couple of specifics that I'm still bouncing around with my staff; so we're not rolling out some five-point plan, but some areas where I think all of us could potentially focus.",7
2013-07-14,oba,"Number one, precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the State and local level, I think it would be productive for the Justice Department, Governors, mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the State and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists.",13
2013-07-14,oba,"When I was in Illinois, I passed racial profiling legislation, and it actually did just two simple things.",4
2013-07-14,oba,"One, it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped.",6
2013-07-14,oba,But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the State on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing.,7
2013-07-14,oba,"And initially, the police departments across the State were resistant, but actually, they came to recognize that if it was done in a fair, straightforward way, that it would allow them to do their jobs better and communities would have more confidence in them and, in turn, be more helpful in applying the law.",10
2013-07-14,oba,"And obviously, law enforcement has got a very tough job.",3
2013-07-14,oba,So that's one area where I think there are a lot of resources and best practices that could be brought to bear if State and local governments are receptive.,9
2013-07-14,oba,And I think a lot of them would be.,4
2013-07-14,oba,"And let's figure out, are there ways for us to push out that kind of training?",5
2013-07-14,oba,"Along the same lines, I think it would be useful for us to examine some State and local laws to see if it—if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than diffuse potential altercations.",14
2013-07-14,oba,"I know that there's been commentary about the fact that the ""Stand Your Ground"" laws in Florida were not used as a defense in the case.",10
2013-07-14,oba,"On the other hand, if we're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see?",8
2013-07-14,oba,"And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these ""Stand Your Ground"" laws, I'd just ask people to consider, if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk?",11
2013-07-14,oba,"And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened?",8
2013-07-14,oba,"And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws.",5
2013-07-14,oba,Number three—and this is a long-term project—we need to spend some time in thinking about how do we bolster and reinforce our African American boys.,8
2013-07-14,oba,And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about.,4
2013-07-14,oba,There are a lot of kids out there who need help who are getting a lot of negative reinforcement.,8
2013-07-14,oba,And is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them?,10
2013-07-14,oba,I'm not naive about the prospects of some grand new Federal program.,6
2013-07-14,oba,I'm not sure that that's what we're talking about here.,5
2013-07-14,oba,"But I do recognize that as President, I've got some convening power, and there are a lot of good programs that are being done across the country on this front.",9
2013-07-14,oba,"And for us to be able to gather together business leaders and local elected officials and clergy and celebrities and athletes and figure out how are we doing a better job helping young African American men feel that they're a full part of this society and that they've got pathways and avenues to succeed, I think that would be a pretty good outcome from what was obviously a tragic situation.",9
2013-07-14,oba,And we're going to spend some time working on that and thinking about that.,5
2013-07-14,oba,"And then, finally, I think it's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching.",6
2013-07-14,oba,"There has been talk about, should we convene a conversation on race?",3
2013-07-14,oba,I haven't seen that be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations.,4
2013-07-14,oba,"They end up being stilted and politicized, and folks are locked into the positions they already have.",5
2013-07-14,oba,"On the other hand, in families and churches and workplaces, there's a possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?",6
2013-07-14,oba,"Am I judging people as much as I can, based on not the color of their skin, but the content of their character?",6
2013-07-14,oba,"That would, I think, be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy.",6
2013-07-14,oba,"And let me just leave you with a final thought that, as difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people, I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting better.",9
2013-07-14,oba,Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race.,7
2013-07-14,oba,It doesn't mean we're in a postracial society.,4
2013-07-14,oba,It doesn't mean that racism is eliminated.,3
2013-07-14,oba,"But when I talk to Malia and Sasha, and I listen to their friends, and I see them interact, they're better than we are—they're better than we were—on these issues.",5
2013-07-14,oba,And that's true in every community that I've visited all across the country.,6
2013-07-14,oba,"And so we have to be vigilant, and we have to work on these issues.",5
2013-07-14,oba,"And those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature, as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions.",6
2013-07-14,oba,"But we should also have confidence that kids these days, I think, have more sense than we did back then and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did and that along this long, difficult journey, we're becoming a more perfect Union, not a perfect Union, but a more perfect Union.",5

2013-08-29,oba,"Entrenched interests, those who benefit from an unjust status quo, resisted any government efforts to give working families a fair deal -- marshaling an army of lobbyists and opinion makers to argue that minimum wage increases or stronger labor laws or taxes on the wealthy who could afford it just to fund crumbling schools, that all these things violated sound economic principles.",6

2013-09-11,oba,They distributed gasmasks to their troops.,3

2013-09-11,oba,"The question now is what the United States of America, and the international community, is prepared to do about it.",5
2013-09-11,oba,"Because what happened to those people -- to those children -- is not only a violation of international law, it’s also a danger to our security.",5
2013-09-11,oba,Let me explain why.,2
2013-09-11,oba,"If we fail to act, the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons.",5
2013-09-11,oba,"As the ban against these weapons erodes, other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas, and using them.",6
2013-09-11,oba,"Over time, our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield.",4
2013-09-11,oba,"And it could be easier for terrorist organizations to obtain these weapons, and to use them to attack civilians.",4
2013-09-11,oba,"If fighting spills beyond Syria’s borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan, and Israel.",5
2013-09-11,oba,"And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction, and embolden Assad’s ally, Iran -- which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon, or to take a more peaceful path.",8
2013-09-11,oba,This is not a world we should accept.,3
2013-09-11,oba,This is what’s at stake.,3
2013-09-11,oba,"And that is why, after careful deliberation, I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike.",8
2013-09-11,oba,"The purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, to degrade his regime’s ability to use them, and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use.",9
2013-09-11,oba,That's my judgment as Commander-in-Chief.,5
2013-09-11,oba,But I’m also the President of the world’s oldest constitutional democracy.,5

2013-09-11,oba,I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress.,6
2013-09-11,oba,And I believe that America acts more effectively abroad when we stand together.,3
2013-09-11,oba,"This is especially true after a decade that put more and more war-making power in the hands of the President, and more and more burdens on the shoulders of our troops, while sidelining the people’s representatives from the critical decisions about when we use force.",8
2013-09-11,oba,"Now, I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action, no matter how limited, is not going to be popular.",6

2013-09-11,oba,Our troops are out of Iraq.,3
2013-09-11,oba,Our troops are coming home from Afghanistan.,2

2013-09-11,oba,"It’s no wonder, then, that you're asking hard questions.",3
2013-09-11,oba,"So let me answer some of the most important questions that I've heard from members of Congress, and that I've read in letters that you've sent to me.",9
2013-09-11,oba,"First, many of you have asked, won’t this put us on a slippery slope to another war?",6
2013-09-11,oba,"One man wrote to me that we are “still recovering from our involvement in Iraq.”  A veteran put it more bluntly:  “This nation is sick and tired of war.”

My answer is simple:  I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.",5
2013-09-11,oba,I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.,4
2013-09-11,oba,I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.,4
2013-09-11,oba,"This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective:  deterring the use of chemical weapons, and degrading Assad’s capabilities.",6
2013-09-11,oba,Others have asked whether it's worth acting if we don’t take out Assad.,3
2013-09-11,oba,"As some members of Congress have said, there’s no point in simply doing a “pinprick” strike in Syria.",5
2013-09-11,oba,Let me make something clear:  The United States military doesn’t do pinpricks.,4
2013-09-11,oba,Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver.,3
2013-09-11,oba,I don't think we should remove another dictator with force -- we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next.,6
2013-09-11,oba,"But a targeted strike can make Assad, or any other dictator, think twice before using chemical weapons.",5
2013-09-11,oba,Other questions involve the dangers of retaliation.,3
2013-09-11,oba,"We don’t dismiss any threats, but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military.",5
2013-09-11,oba,Any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day.,7
2013-09-11,oba,Neither Assad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise.,7
2013-09-11,oba,"And our ally, Israel, can defend itself with overwhelming force, as well as the unshakeable support of the United States of America.",7
2013-09-11,oba,"Many of you have asked a broader question:  Why should we get involved at all in a place that's so complicated, and where  -- as one person wrote to me -- “those who come after Assad may be enemies of human rights?”

It’s true that some of Assad’s opponents are extremists.",10
2013-09-11,oba,But al Qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria if people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from being gassed to death.,7
2013-09-11,oba,"The majority of the Syrian people -- and the Syrian opposition we work with -- just want to live in peace, with dignity and freedom.",4
2013-09-11,oba,"And the day after any military action, we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism.",10
2013-09-11,oba,"Finally, many of you have asked:  Why not leave this to other countries, or seek solutions short of force?",6
2013-09-11,oba,"As several people wrote to me, “We should not be the world’s policeman.”

I agree, and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions.",3
2013-09-11,oba,"Over the last two years, my administration has tried diplomacy and sanctions, warning and negotiations -- but chemical weapons were still used by the Assad regime.",4
2013-09-11,oba,"However, over the last few days, we’ve seen some encouraging signs.",3
2013-09-11,oba,"In part because of the credible threat of U.S. military action, as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin, the Russian government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Assad to give up his chemical weapons.",8
2013-09-11,oba,"The Assad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons, and even said they’d join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits their use.",7
2013-09-11,oba,"It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.",5
2013-09-11,oba,"But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad’s strongest allies.",8
2013-09-11,oba,"I have, therefore, asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path.",7
2013-09-11,oba,"I’m sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday, and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin.",5
2013-09-11,oba,"I’ve spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies, France and the United Kingdom, and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons, and to ultimately destroy them under international control.",9
2013-09-11,oba,We’ll also give U.N. inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about what happened on August 21st.,8
2013-09-11,oba,And we will continue to rally support from allies from Europe to the Americas -- from Asia to the Middle East -- who agree on the need for action.,10
2013-09-11,oba,"Meanwhile, I’ve ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad, and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.",8
2013-09-11,oba,"And tonight, I give thanks again to our military and their families for their incredible strength and sacrifices.",4
2013-09-11,oba,"My fellow Americans, for nearly seven decades, the United States has been the anchor of global security.",4
2013-09-11,oba,This has meant doing more than forging international agreements -- it has meant enforcing them.,7
2013-09-11,oba,"The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world is a better place because we have borne them.",3
2013-09-11,oba,"And so, to my friends on the right, I ask you to reconcile your commitment to America’s military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just.",8
2013-09-11,oba,"To my friends on the left, I ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those images of children writhing in pain, and going still on a cold hospital floor.",11
2013-09-11,oba,For sometimes resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough.,4
2013-09-11,oba,"Indeed, I’d ask every member of Congress, and those of you watching at home tonight, to view those videos of the attack, and then ask:  What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas, and we choose to look the other way?",8
2013-09-11,oba,"Franklin Roosevelt once said, “Our national determination to keep free of foreign wars and foreign entanglements cannot prevent us from feeling deep concern when ideals and principles that we have cherished are challenged.”  Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria, along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used.",8
2013-09-11,oba,America is not the world’s policeman.,3
2013-09-11,oba,"Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong.",4
2013-09-11,oba,"But when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act.",6
2013-09-11,oba,That’s what makes America different.,3
2013-09-11,oba,That’s what makes us exceptional.,3
2013-09-11,oba,"With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.",5

2013-10-02,oba,"Good morning, everybody.",2
2013-10-02,oba,"At midnight last night, for the first time in 17 years, Republicans in Congress chose to shut down the federal government.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"Let me be more specific:  One faction, of one party, in one house of Congress, in one branch of government, shut down major parts of the government -- all because they didn’t like one law.",5
2013-10-02,oba,This Republican shutdown did not have to happen.,2
2013-10-02,oba,But I want every American to understand why it did happen.,3
2013-10-02,oba,Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the Affordable Care Act.,5
2013-10-02,oba,They’ve shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans.,7
2013-10-02,oba,"In other words, they demanded ransom just for doing their job.",4
2013-10-02,oba,"And many representatives, including an increasing number of Republicans, have made it clear that had they been allowed by Speaker Boehner to take a simple up or down vote on keeping the government open, with no partisan strings attached, enough votes from both parties would have kept the American people’s government open and operating.",9
2013-10-02,oba,We may not know the full impact of this Republican shutdown for some time.,4
2013-10-02,oba,It will depend on how long it lasts.,4
2013-10-02,oba,But we do know a couple of things.,3
2013-10-02,oba,"We know that the last time Republicans shut down the government in 1996, it hurt our economy.",4
2013-10-02,oba,"And unlike 1996, our economy is still recovering from the worst recession in generations.",4
2013-10-02,oba,We know that certain services and benefits that America’s seniors and veterans and business owners depend on must be put on hold.,7
2013-10-02,oba,"Certain offices, along with every national park and monument, must be closed.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"And while last night, I signed legislation to make sure our 1.4 million active-duty military are paid through the shutdown, hundreds of thousands of civilian workers -- many still on the job, many forced to stay home -- aren’t being paid, even if they have families to support and local businesses that rely on them.",7
2013-10-02,oba,"And we know that the longer this shutdown continues, the worse the effects will be.",4
2013-10-02,oba,More families will be hurt.,2
2013-10-02,oba,More businesses will be harmed.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"So, once again, I urge House Republicans to reopen the government, restart the services Americans depend on, and allow the public servants who have been sent home to return to work.",7
2013-10-02,oba,This is only going to happen when Republicans realize they don’t get to hold the entire economy hostage over ideological demands.,7
2013-10-02,oba,"As I’ve said repeatedly, I am prepared to work with Democrats and Republicans to do the things we need to do to grow the economy and create jobs, and get our fiscal house in order over the long run.",9
2013-10-02,oba,"Although I should add this shutdown isn’t about deficits, or spending, or budgets.",4
2013-10-02,oba,"After all, our deficits are falling at the fastest pace in 50 years.",3
2013-10-02,oba,We’ve cut them in half since I took office.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"In fact, many of the demands the Republicans are now making would actually raise our deficits.",6
2013-10-02,oba,"No, this shutdown is not about deficits, it’s not about budgets.",3
2013-10-02,oba,This shutdown is about rolling back our efforts to provide health insurance to folks who don’t have it.,8
2013-10-02,oba,It’s all about rolling back the Affordable Care Act.,5
2013-10-02,oba,"This, more than anything else, seems to be what the Republican Party stands for these days.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"I know it’s strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda, but that apparently is what it is.",8
2013-10-02,oba,"And of course, what’s stranger still is that shutting down our government doesn’t accomplish their stated goal.",4
2013-10-02,oba,The Affordable Care Act is a law that passed the House; it passed the Senate.,5
2013-10-02,oba,The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional.,2
2013-10-02,oba,It was a central issue in last year’s election.,5

2013-10-02,oba,"It’s been a long time coming, but today, Americans who have been forced to go without insurance can now visit healthcare.gov and enroll in affordable new plans that offer quality coverage.",7
2013-10-02,oba,That starts today.,1
2013-10-02,oba,And people will have six months to sign up.,3
2013-10-02,oba,"So over the next six months, people are going to have the opportunity -- in many cases, for the first time in their lives -- to get affordable coverage that they desperately need.",6

2013-10-02,oba,You’re already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law.,8
2013-10-02,oba,"But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance, this opportunity is life-changing.",7
2013-10-02,oba,Let me just tell folks a few stories that are represented here today.,4
2013-10-02,oba,"A few years ago, Amanda Barrett left her job in New York to take care of her parents.",4
2013-10-02,oba,"And for a while, she had temporary insurance that covered her multiple sclerosis.",4
2013-10-02,oba,"But when it expired, many insurers wouldn’t cover her because of her MS.  And she ended up paying $1,200 a month.",3
2013-10-02,oba,That’s nowhere near affordable.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"So starting today, she can get covered for much less, because today’s new plan can’t use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else.",6
2013-10-02,oba,Sky-high premiums once forced Nancy Beigel to choose between paying her rent or paying for health insurance.,7
2013-10-02,oba,She’s been uninsured ever since.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"So she pays all of her medical bills out of pocket, puts some on her credit card, making them even harder to pay.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"Nancy says, “They talk about those who fall through the cracks.",7
2013-10-02,oba,"I fell through the cracks 10 years ago and I’ve been stuck there ever since.”  Well, starting today, Nancy can get covered just like everybody else.",3
2013-10-02,oba,Trinace Edwards was laid off from her job a year ago today.,3
2013-10-02,oba,"Six months ago, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor.",3
2013-10-02,oba,"She couldn’t afford insurance on the individual market, so she hasn’t received treatment yet.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"Her daughter Lenace, a student at the University of Maryland, is considering dropping out of school to help pay her mom’s bills.",6
2013-10-02,oba,"Well, starting today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Trinace can get covered without forcing her daughter to give up on her dreams.",6
2013-10-02,oba,"So if these stories of hardworking Americans sound familiar to you, well, starting today, you and your friends and your family and your coworkers can get covered, too.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"Just visit healthcare.gov, and there you can compare insurance plans, side by side, the same way you’d shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon.",10
2013-10-02,oba,"You enter some basic information, you’ll be presented with a list of quality, affordable plans that are available in your area, with clear descriptions of what each plan covers, and what it will cost.",9
2013-10-02,oba,"You’ll find more choices, more competition, and in many cases, lower prices -- most uninsured Americans will find that they can get covered for $100 or less.",6
2013-10-02,oba,And you don't have to take my word for it.,3
2013-10-02,oba,"Go on the website, healthcare.gov, check it out for yourself.",4
2013-10-02,oba,"And then show it to your family and your friends and help them get covered, just like mayors and churches and community groups and companies are already fanning out to do across the country.",6
2013-10-02,oba,"And there’s a hotline where you can apply over the phone and get help with the application, or just get questions that you have answered by real people, in 150 different languages.",9
2013-10-02,oba,So let me give you that number.,3
2013-10-02,oba,The number is 1-800-318-2596 -- 1-800-318-2596.,2
2013-10-02,oba,Check out healthcare.gov.,1
2013-10-02,oba,Call that number.,2
2013-10-02,oba,Show your family and friends how to use it.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"And we can get America covered, once and for all, so that the struggles that these folks have gone through and millions around the country have gone through for years finally get addressed.",8
2013-10-02,oba,And let me just remind people why I think this is so important.,5
2013-10-02,oba,"I heard a striking statistic yesterday -- if you get cancer, you are 70 percent more likely to live another five years if you have insurance than if you don’t.",5
2013-10-02,oba,Think about that.,2
2013-10-02,oba,That is what it means to have health insurance.,4
2013-10-02,oba,"Set aside the issues of security and finances and how you’re impacted by that, the stress involved in not knowing whether or not you’re going to have health care.",8
2013-10-02,oba,This is life-or-death stuff.,4
2013-10-02,oba,Tens of thousands of Americans die each year just because they don’t have health insurance.,3
2013-10-02,oba,Millions more live with the fear that they’ll go broke if they get sick.,5
2013-10-02,oba,"And today, we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"Already, millions of young adults have been able to stay on their parents’ plans until they turn 26.",6
2013-10-02,oba,Millions of seniors already have gotten a discount on their prescription medicines.,4
2013-10-02,oba,Already millions of families have actually received rebates from insurance companies that didn’t spend enough on their health care.,6
2013-10-02,oba,"So this law means more choice, more competition, lower costs for millions of Americans.",6
2013-10-02,oba,And this law doesn’t just mean economic security for our families.,4
2013-10-02,oba,It means we’re finally addressing the biggest drivers of our long-term deficits.,6
2013-10-02,oba,It means a stronger economy.,2
2013-10-02,oba,Remember most Republicans have made a whole bunch of predictions about this law that haven’t come true.,8
2013-10-02,oba,There are no “death panels.”  Costs haven’t skyrocketed; they’re growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.,2
2013-10-02,oba,The last three years since I signed the Affordable Care Act into law are the three slowest rates of health spending growth on record.,5
2013-10-02,oba,"And contrary to Republican claims, this law hasn’t “destroyed” our economy.",4
2013-10-02,oba,"Over the past three and a half years, our businesses have created 7.5 million new jobs.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"Just today, we learned that our manufacturers are growing at the fastest rate in two and a half years.",8
2013-10-02,oba,They have factored in the Affordable Care Act.,4
2013-10-02,oba,They don't think it’s a problem.,3
2013-10-02,oba,"What’s weighing on the economy is not the Affordable Care Act, but the constant series of crises and the unwillingness to pass a reasonable budget by a faction of the Republican Party.",8
2013-10-02,oba,"Now, like every new law, every new product rollout, there are going to be some glitches in the signup process along the way that we will fix.",6
2013-10-02,oba,I’ve been saying this from the start.,3
2013-10-02,oba,"For example, we found out that there have been times this morning where the site has been running more slowly than it normally will.",5
2013-10-02,oba,The reason is because more than one million people visited healthcare.gov before 7:00 in the morning.,4
2013-10-02,oba,"To put that in context, there were five times more users in the marketplace this morning than have ever been on Medicare.gov at one time.",4
2013-10-02,oba,"That gives you a sense of how important this is to millions of Americans around the country, and that’s a good thing.",10
2013-10-02,oba,And we're going to be speeding things up in the next few hours to handle all this demand that exceeds anything that we had expected.,7
2013-10-02,oba,"Consider that just a couple of weeks ago, Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"And within days, they found a glitch, so they fixed it.",3
2013-10-02,oba,I don’t remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads -- or threatening to shut down the company if they didn’t.,5
2013-10-02,oba,That’s not how we do things in America.,3
2013-10-02,oba,We don’t actively root for failure.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"We get to work, we make things happen, we make them better, we keep going.",5
2013-10-02,oba,"So in that context, I'll work with anybody who’s got a serious idea to make the Affordable Care Act work better.",8
2013-10-02,oba,I've said that repeatedly.,1
2013-10-02,oba,"But as long as I am President, I will not give in to reckless demands by some in the Republican Party to deny affordable health insurance to millions of hardworking Americans.",8
2013-10-02,oba,I want Republicans in Congress to know these are the Americans you’d hurt if you were allowed to dismantle this law.,8
2013-10-02,oba,"Americans like Amanda, Nancy, and Trinace, who now finally have the opportunity for basic security and peace of mind of health care just like everybody else -- including members of Congress.",11
2013-10-02,oba,The notion that you’d make a condition for reopening the government that I make sure these folks don’t have health care -- that doesn’t make any sense.,6
2013-10-02,oba,It doesn’t make any sense.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"Now, let me make one closing point:  This Republican shutdown threatens our economy at a time when millions of Americans are still looking for work, and businesses are starting to get some traction.",7
2013-10-02,oba,So the timing is not good.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"Of course, a lot of the Republicans in the House ran for office two years ago promising to shut down the government, and so, apparently, they've now gotten their wish.",6
2013-10-02,oba,"But as I've said before, the irony that the House Republicans have to contend with is they've shut down a whole bunch of parts of the government, but the Affordable Care Act is still open for business.",7
2013-10-02,oba,"And this may be why you've got many Republican governors and senators and even a growing number of reasonable Republican congressmen who are telling the extreme right of their party to knock it off, pass a budget, move on.",10
2013-10-02,oba,And I want to underscore the fact that Congress doesn’t just have to end this shutdown and reopen the government -- Congress generally has to stop governing by crisis.,8
2013-10-02,oba,They have to break this habit.,3
2013-10-02,oba,It is a drag on the economy.,4
2013-10-02,oba,It is not worthy of this country.,4
2013-10-02,oba,"For example, one of the most important things Congress has to do in the next couple weeks is to raise what's called the debt ceiling.",9
2013-10-02,oba,And it's important to understand what this is.,3
2013-10-02,oba,This is a routine vote.,2
2013-10-02,oba,Congress has taken this vote 45 times to raise the debt ceiling since Ronald Reagan took office.,4
2013-10-02,oba,It does not cost taxpayers a single dime.,2
2013-10-02,oba,It does not grow our deficits by a single dime.,3
2013-10-02,oba,It does not authorize anybody to spend any new money whatsoever.,3
2013-10-02,oba,All it does is authorize the Treasury to pay the bills on what Congress has already spent.,5
2013-10-02,oba,Think about that.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"If you buy a car and you’ve got a car note, you do not save money by not paying your car note.",4
2013-10-02,oba,You’re just a deadbeat.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"If you buy a house, you don’t save money by not authorizing yourself to pay the mortgage.",5
2013-10-02,oba,You’re just going to be foreclosed on your home.,4
2013-10-02,oba,That’s what this is about.,3
2013-10-02,oba,It is routine.,1
2013-10-02,oba,It is what they’re supposed to do.,3
2013-10-02,oba,This is not a concession to me.,3
2013-10-02,oba,It is not some demand that’s unreasonable that I’m making.,4
2013-10-02,oba,This is what Congress is supposed to do as a routine matter.,5
2013-10-02,oba,And they shouldn’t wait until the last minute to do it.,4
2013-10-02,oba,"The last time Republicans even threatened this course of action -- many of you remember, back in 2011 -- our economy staggered, our credit rating was downgraded for the first time.",6
2013-10-02,oba,"If they go through with it this time and force the United States to default on its obligations for the first time in history, it would be far more dangerous than a government shutdown -- as bad as a shutdown is.",7
2013-10-02,oba,It would be an economic shutdown.,2
2013-10-02,oba,"So I’ll speak more on this in the coming days, but let me repeat:  I will not negotiate over Congress’s responsibility to pay bills it’s already racked up.",6
2013-10-02,oba,I’m not going to allow anybody to drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud just to refight a settled election or extract ideological demands.,7
2013-10-02,oba,Nobody gets to hurt our economy and millions of hardworking families over a law you don’t like.,5
2013-10-02,oba,"There are a whole bunch of things that I’d like to see passed through Congress that the House Republicans haven’t passed yet, and I’m not out there saying, well, I’m not -- I’m going to let America default unless Congress does something that they don’t want to do.",8
2013-10-02,oba,That’s not how adults operate.,2
2013-10-02,oba,Certainly that’s not how our government should operate.,3
2013-10-02,oba,And that’s true whether there’s a Democrat in this office or a Republican in this office.,6
2013-10-02,oba,Doesn’t matter whether it’s a Democratic House of Representatives or a Republican-controlled House of Representatives -- there are certain rules that everybody abides by because we don’t want to hurt other people just because we have a political disagreement.,6
2013-10-02,oba,So my basic message to Congress is this:  Pass a budget.,5
2013-10-02,oba,End the government shutdown.,2
2013-10-02,oba,Pay your bills.,2
2013-10-02,oba,Prevent an economic shutdown.,2
2013-10-02,oba,Don’t wait.,1
2013-10-02,oba,Don’t delay.,1
2013-10-02,oba,Don’t put our economy or our people through this any longer.,3
2013-10-02,oba,I am more than happy to work with them on all kinds of issues.,8
2013-10-02,oba,"I want to get back to work on the things that the American people sent us here to work on -- creating new jobs, new growth, new security for our middle class.",13
2013-10-02,oba,We’re better than this.,3
2013-10-02,oba,Certainly the American people are a lot better than this.,3
2013-10-02,oba,"And I believe that what we’ve accomplished for Amanda, and Nancy, and Trinace, and tens of millions of their fellow citizens- on this day proves that even when the odds are long and the obstacles are many, we are and always will be a country that can do great things together.",7
2013-10-02,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2013-10-02,oba,God bless you.,1

2014-01-18,oba,"First, the same technological advances that allow U.S. intelligence agencies to pinpoint an al Qaeda cell in Yemen or an email between two terrorists in the Sahel also mean that many routine communications around the world are within our reach.",10
2014-01-18,oba,"And at a time when more and more of our lives are digital, that prospect is disquieting for all of us.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Second, the combination of increased digital information and powerful supercomputers offers intelligence agencies the possibility of sifting through massive amounts of bulk data to identify patterns or pursue leads that may thwart impending threats.",9
2014-01-18,oba,It’s a powerful tool.,2
2014-01-18,oba,But the government collection and storage of such bulk data also creates a potential for abuse.,4
2014-01-18,oba,"Third, the legal safeguards that restrict surveillance against U.S. persons without a warrant do not apply to foreign persons overseas.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"This is not unique to America; few, if any, spy agencies around the world constrain their activities beyond their own borders.",4
2014-01-18,oba,And the whole point of intelligence is to obtain information that is not publicly available.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"But America’s capabilities are unique, and the power of new technologies means that there are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do.",6
2014-01-18,oba,That places a special obligation on us to ask tough questions about what we should do.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"And finally, intelligence agencies cannot function without secrecy, which makes their work less subject to public debate.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Yet there is an inevitable bias not only within the intelligence community, but among all of us who are responsible for national security, to collect more information about the world, not less.",11
2014-01-18,oba,"So in the absence of institutional requirements for regular debate -- and oversight that is public, as well as private or classified -- the danger of government overreach becomes more acute.",7
2014-01-18,oba,And this is particularly true when surveillance technology and our reliance on digital information is evolving much faster than our laws.,6
2014-01-18,oba,"For all these reasons, I maintained a healthy skepticism toward our surveillance programs after I became President.",4
2014-01-18,oba,"I ordered that our programs be reviewed by my national security team and our lawyers, and in some cases I ordered changes in how we did business.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"We increased oversight and auditing, including new structures aimed at compliance.",5
2014-01-18,oba,Improved rules were proposed by the government and approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.,5
2014-01-18,oba,And we sought to keep Congress continually updated on these activities.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"What I did not do is stop these programs wholesale -- not only because I felt that they made us more secure, but also because nothing in that initial review, and nothing that I have learned since, indicated that our intelligence community has sought to violate the law or is cavalier about the civil liberties of their fellow citizens.",10
2014-01-18,oba,"To the contrary, in an extraordinarily difficult job -- one in which actions are second-guessed, success is unreported, and failure can be catastrophic -- the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people.",8
2014-01-18,oba,They’re not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls or read your emails.,6
2014-01-18,oba,When mistakes are made -- which is inevitable in any large and complicated human enterprise -- they correct those mistakes.,6
2014-01-18,oba,"Laboring in obscurity, often unable to discuss their work even with family and friends, the men and women at the NSA know that if another 9/11 or massive cyber-attack occurs, they will be asked, by Congress and the media, why they failed to connect the dots.",6
2014-01-18,oba,What sustains those who work at NSA and our other intelligence agencies through all these pressures is the knowledge that their professionalism and dedication play a central role in the defense of our nation.,7
2014-01-18,oba,"Now, to say that our intelligence community follows the law, and is staffed by patriots, is not to suggest that I or others in my administration felt complacent about the potential impact of these programs.",8
2014-01-18,oba,"Those of us who hold office in America have a responsibility to our Constitution, and while I was confident in the integrity of those who lead our intelligence community, it was clear to me in observing our intelligence operations on a regular basis that changes in our technological capabilities were raising new questions about the privacy safeguards currently in place.",11
2014-01-18,oba,"Moreover, after an extended review of our use of drones in the fight against terrorist networks, I believed a fresh examination of our surveillance programs was a necessary next step in our effort to get off the open-ended war footing that we’ve maintained since 9/11.",11
2014-01-18,oba,"And for these reasons, I indicated in a speech at the National Defense University last May that we needed a more robust public discussion about the balance between security and liberty.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Of course, what I did not know at the time is that within weeks of my speech, an avalanche of unauthorized disclosures would spark controversies at home and abroad that have continued to this day.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"And given the fact of an open investigation, I’m not going to dwell on Mr. Snowden’s actions or his motivations; I will say that our nation’s defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation’s secrets.",10
2014-01-18,oba,"If any individual who objects to government policy can take it into their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will not be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"Moreover, the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light, while revealing methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations in ways that we may not fully understand for years to come.",12
2014-01-18,oba,"Regardless of how we got here, though, the task before us now is greater than simply repairing the damage done to our operations or preventing more disclosures from taking place in the future.",11
2014-01-18,oba,"Instead, we have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves and sustain our leadership in the world, while upholding the civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals and our Constitution require.",12
2014-01-18,oba,"We need to do so not only because it is right, but because the challenges posed by threats like terrorism and proliferation and cyber-attacks are not going away any time soon.",9
2014-01-18,oba,They are going to continue to be a major problem.,4
2014-01-18,oba,"And for our intelligence community to be effective over the long haul, we must maintain the trust of the American people, and people around the world.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"This effort will not be completed overnight, and given the pace of technological change, we shouldn’t expect this to be the last time America has this debate.",6
2014-01-18,oba,But I want the American people to know that the work has begun.,4
2014-01-18,oba,"Over the last six months, I created an outside Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies to make recommendations for reform.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"I consulted with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, created by Congress.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"I’ve listened to foreign partners, privacy advocates, and industry leaders.",5
2014-01-18,oba,My administration has spent countless hours considering how to approach intelligence in this era of diffuse threats and technological revolution.,8
2014-01-18,oba,"So before outlining specific changes that I’ve ordered, let me make a few broad observations that have emerged from this process.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"First, everyone who has looked at these problems, including skeptics of existing programs, recognizes that we have real enemies and threats, and that intelligence serves a vital role in confronting them.",9
2014-01-18,oba,We cannot prevent terrorist attacks or cyber threats without some capability to penetrate digital communications -- whether it’s to unravel a terrorist plot; to intercept malware that targets a stock exchange; to make sure air traffic control systems are not compromised; or to ensure that hackers do not empty your bank accounts.,6
2014-01-18,oba,We are expected to protect the American people; that requires us to have capabilities in this field.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"Moreover, we cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies.",2
2014-01-18,oba,There is a reason why BlackBerrys and iPhones are not allowed in the White House Situation Room.,6
2014-01-18,oba,"We know that the intelligence services of other countries -- including some who feign surprise over the Snowden disclosures -- are constantly probing our government and private sector networks, and accelerating programs to listen to our conversations, and intercept our emails, and compromise our systems.",11
2014-01-18,oba,We know that.,1
2014-01-18,oba,"Meanwhile, a number of countries, including some who have loudly criticized the NSA, privately acknowledge that America has special responsibilities as the world’s only superpower; that our intelligence capabilities are critical to meeting these responsibilities, and that they themselves have relied on the information we obtain to protect their own people.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Second, just as ardent civil libertarians recognize the need for robust intelligence capabilities, those with responsibilities for our national security readily acknowledge the potential for abuse as intelligence capabilities advance and more and more private information is digitized.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"After all, the folks at NSA and other intelligence agencies are our neighbors.",5
2014-01-18,oba,They're our friends and family.,2
2014-01-18,oba,They’ve got electronic bank and medical records like everybody else.,4
2014-01-18,oba,"They have kids on Facebook and Instagram, and they know, more than most of us, the vulnerabilities to privacy that exist in a world where transactions are recorded, and emails and text and messages are stored, and even our movements can increasingly be tracked through the GPS on our phones.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Third, there was a recognition by all who participated in these reviews that the challenges to our privacy do not come from government alone.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Corporations of all shapes and sizes track what you buy, store and analyze our data, and use it for commercial purposes; that’s how those targeted ads pop up on your computer and your smartphone periodically.",6
2014-01-18,oba,But all of us understand that the standards for government surveillance must be higher.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"Given the unique power of the state, it is not enough for leaders to say:  Trust us, we won’t abuse the data we collect.",6
2014-01-18,oba,For history has too many examples when that trust has been breached.,3
2014-01-18,oba,Our system of government is built on the premise that our liberty cannot depend on the good intentions of those in power; it depends on the law to constrain those in power.,10
2014-01-18,oba,I make these observations to underscore that the basic values of most Americans when it comes to questions of surveillance and privacy converge a lot more than the crude characterizations that have emerged over the last several months.,9
2014-01-18,oba,"Those who are troubled by our existing programs are not interested in repeating the tragedy of 9/11, and those who defend these programs are not dismissive of civil liberties.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"The challenge is getting the details right, and that is not simple.",2
2014-01-18,oba,"In fact, during the course of our review, I have often reminded myself I would not be where I am today were it not for the courage of dissidents like Dr. King, who were spied upon by their own government.",11
2014-01-18,oba,"And as President, a President who looks at intelligence every morning, I also can’t help but be reminded that America must be vigilant in the face of threats.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Fortunately, by focusing on facts and specifics rather than speculation and hypotheticals, this review process has given me -- and hopefully the American people -- some clear direction for change.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"And today, I can announce a series of concrete and substantial reforms that my administration intends to adopt administratively or will seek to codify with Congress.",9
2014-01-18,oba,"First, I have approved a new presidential directive for our signals intelligence activities both at home and abroad.",6
2014-01-18,oba,This guidance will strengthen executive branch oversight of our intelligence activities.,4
2014-01-18,oba,"It will ensure that we take into account our security requirements, but also our alliances; our trade and investment relationships, including the concerns of American companies; and our commitment to privacy and basic liberties.",7
2014-01-18,oba,And we will review decisions about intelligence priorities and sensitive targets on an annual basis so that our actions are regularly scrutinized by my senior national security team.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"Second, we will reform programs and procedures in place to provide greater transparency to our surveillance activities, and fortify the safeguards that protect the privacy of U.S. persons.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Since we began this review, including information being released today, we have declassified over 40 opinions and orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which provides judicial review of some of our most sensitive intelligence activities -- including the Section 702 program targeting foreign individuals overseas, and the Section 215 telephone metadata program.",14
2014-01-18,oba,"And going forward, I’m directing the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Attorney General, to annually review for the purposes of declassification any future opinions of the court with broad privacy implications, and to report to me and to Congress on these efforts.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"To ensure that the court hears a broader range of privacy perspectives, I am also calling on Congress to authorize the establishment of a panel of advocates from outside government to provide an independent voice in significant cases before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.",9
2014-01-18,oba,"Third, we will provide additional protections for activities conducted under Section 702, which allows the government to intercept the communications of foreign targets overseas who have information that’s important for our national security.",18
2014-01-18,oba,"Specifically, I am asking the Attorney General and DNI to institute reforms that place additional restrictions on government’s ability to retain, search, and use in criminal cases communications between Americans and foreign citizens incidentally collected under Section 702.",15
2014-01-18,oba,"Fourth, in investigating threats, the FBI also relies on what's called national security letters, which can require companies to provide specific and limited information to the government without disclosing the orders to the subject of the investigation.",12
2014-01-18,oba,"These are cases in which it's important that the subject of the investigation, such as a possible terrorist or spy, isn’t tipped off.",9
2014-01-18,oba,But we can and should be more transparent in how government uses this authority.,4
2014-01-18,oba,"I have therefore directed the Attorney General to amend how we use national security letters so that this secrecy will not be indefinite, so that it will terminate within a fixed time unless the government demonstrates a real need for further secrecy.",9
2014-01-18,oba,We will also enable communications providers to make public more information than ever before about the orders that they have received to provide data to the government.,8
2014-01-18,oba,This brings me to the program that has generated the most controversy these past few months -- the bulk collection of telephone records under Section 215.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"Let me repeat what I said when this story first broke:  This program does not involve the content of phone calls, or the names of people making calls.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Instead, it provides a record of phone numbers and the times and lengths of calls -- metadata that can be queried if and when we have a reasonable suspicion that a particular number is linked to a terrorist organization.",6
2014-01-18,oba,Why is this necessary?,1
2014-01-18,oba,The program grew out of a desire to address a gap identified after 9/11.,8
2014-01-18,oba,One of the 9/11 hijackers -- Khalid al-Mihdhar -- made a phone call from San Diego to a known al Qaeda safe-house in Yemen.,4
2014-01-18,oba,"NSA saw that call, but it could not see that the call was coming from an individual already in the United States.",5
2014-01-18,oba,The telephone metadata program under Section 215 was designed to map the communications of terrorists so we can see who they may be in contact with as quickly as possible.,6
2014-01-18,oba,And this capability could also prove valuable in a crisis.,3
2014-01-18,oba,"For example, if a bomb goes off in one of our cities and law enforcement is racing to determine whether a network is poised to conduct additional attacks, time is of the essence.",7
2014-01-18,oba,Being able to quickly review phone connections to assess whether a network exists is critical to that effort.,7
2014-01-18,oba,"In sum, the program does not involve the NSA examining the phone records of ordinary Americans.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"Rather, it consolidates these records into a database that the government can query if it has a specific lead -- a consolidation of phone records that the companies already retained for business purposes.",10
2014-01-18,oba,The review group turned up no indication that this database has been intentionally abused.,4
2014-01-18,oba,And I believe it is important that the capability that this program is designed to meet is preserved.,6
2014-01-18,oba,"Having said that, I believe critics are right to point out that without proper safeguards, this type of program could be used to yield more information about our private lives, and open the door to more intrusive bulk collection programs in the future.",10
2014-01-18,oba,"They’re also right to point out that although the telephone bulk collection program was subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and has been reauthorized repeatedly by Congress, it has never been subject to vigorous public debate.",11
2014-01-18,oba,"For all these reasons, I believe we need a new approach.",3
2014-01-18,oba,"I am therefore ordering a transition that will end the Section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists, and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the government holding this bulk metadata.",9
2014-01-18,oba,This will not be simple.,1
2014-01-18,oba,"The review group recommended that our current approach be replaced by one in which the providers or a third party retain the bulk records, with government accessing information as needed.",7
2014-01-18,oba,Both of these options pose difficult problems.,4
2014-01-18,oba,"Relying solely on the records of multiple providers, for example, could require companies to alter their procedures in ways that raise new privacy concerns.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"On the other hand, any third party maintaining a single, consolidated database would be carrying out what is essentially a government function but with more expense, more legal ambiguity, potentially less accountability -- all of which would have a doubtful impact on increasing public confidence that their privacy is being protected.",9
2014-01-18,oba,"During the review process, some suggested that we may also be able to preserve the capabilities we need through a combination of existing authorities, better information sharing, and recent technological advances.",12
2014-01-18,oba,But more work needs to be done to determine exactly how this system might work.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"Because of the challenges involved, I’ve ordered that the transition away from the existing program will proceed in two steps.",6
2014-01-18,oba,"Effective immediately, we will only pursue phone calls that are two steps removed from a number associated with a terrorist organization instead of the current three.",11
2014-01-18,oba,"And I have directed the Attorney General to work with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court so that during this transition period, the database can be queried only after a judicial finding or in the case of a true emergency.",8
2014-01-18,oba,"Next, step two, I have instructed the intelligence community and the Attorney General to use this transition period to develop options for a new approach that can match the capabilities and fill the gaps that the Section 215 program was designed to address without the government holding this metadata itself.",14
2014-01-18,oba,They will report back to me with options for alternative approaches before the program comes up for reauthorization on March 28th.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"And during this period, I will consult with the relevant committees in Congress to seek their views, and then seek congressional authorization for the new program as needed.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"Now, the reforms I’m proposing today should give the American people greater confidence that their rights are being protected, even as our intelligence and law enforcement agencies maintain the tools they need to keep us safe.",5
2014-01-18,oba,And I recognize that there are additional issues that require further debate.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"For example, some who participated in our review, as well as some members of Congress, would like to see more sweeping reforms to the use of national security letters so that we have to go to a judge each time before issuing these requests.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"Here, I have concerns that we should not set a standard for terrorism investigations that is higher than those involved in investigating an ordinary crime.",14
2014-01-18,oba,"But I agree that greater oversight on the use of these letters may be appropriate, and I’m prepared to work with Congress on this issue.",7
2014-01-18,oba,There are also those who would like to see different changes to the FISA Court than the ones I’ve proposed.,8
2014-01-18,oba,"On all these issues, I am open to working with Congress to ensure that we build a broad consensus for how to move forward, and I’m confident that we can shape an approach that meets our security needs while upholding the civil liberties of every American.",10
2014-01-18,oba,"Let me now turn to the separate set of concerns that have been raised overseas, and focus on America’s approach to intelligence collection abroad.",7
2014-01-18,oba,"As I’ve indicated, the United States has unique responsibilities when it comes to intelligence collection.",4
2014-01-18,oba,"Our capabilities help protect not only our nation, but our friends and our allies, as well.",4
2014-01-18,oba,"But our efforts will only be effective if ordinary citizens in other countries have confidence that the United States respects their privacy, too.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"And the leaders of our close friends and allies deserve to know that if I want to know what they think about an issue, I’ll pick up the phone and call them, rather than turning to surveillance.",8
2014-01-18,oba,"In other words, just as we balance security and privacy at home, our global leadership demands that we balance our security requirements against our need to maintain the trust and cooperation among people and leaders around the world.",11
2014-01-18,oba,"For that reason, the new presidential directive that I’ve issued today will clearly prescribe what we do, and do not do, when it comes to our overseas surveillance.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"To begin with, the directive makes clear that the United States only uses signals intelligence for legitimate national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary folks.",9
2014-01-18,oba,"I’ve also made it clear that the United States does not collect intelligence to suppress criticism or dissent, nor do we collect intelligence to disadvantage people on the basis of their ethnicity, or race, or gender, or sexual orientation, or religious beliefs.",11
2014-01-18,oba,We do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to U.S. companies or U.S. commercial sectors.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"And in terms of our bulk collection of signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies will only use such data to meet specific security requirements:  counterintelligence, counterterrorism, counter-proliferation, cybersecurity, force protection for our troops and our allies, and combating transnational crime, including sanctions evasion.",8
2014-01-18,oba,"In this directive, I have taken the unprecedented step of extending certain protections that we have for the American people to people overseas.",8
2014-01-18,oba,"I’ve directed the DNI, in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop these safeguards, which will limit the duration that we can hold personal information, while also restricting the use of this information.",10
2014-01-18,oba,"The bottom line is that people around the world, regardless of their nationality, should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don’t threaten our national security, and that we take their privacy concerns into account in our policies and procedures.",7
2014-01-18,oba,This applies to foreign leaders as well.,3
2014-01-18,oba,"Given the understandable attention that this issue has received, I have made clear to the intelligence community that unless there is a compelling national security purpose, we will not monitor the communications of heads of state and government of our close friends and allies.",9
2014-01-18,oba,"And I’ve instructed my national security team, as well as the intelligence community, to work with foreign counterparts to deepen our coordination and cooperation in ways that rebuild trust going forward.",9
2014-01-18,oba,"Now let me be clear:  Our intelligence agencies will continue to gather information about the intentions of governments -- as opposed to ordinary citizens -- around the world, in the same way that the intelligence services of every other nation does.",9
2014-01-18,oba,We will not apologize simply because our services may be more effective.,3
2014-01-18,oba,"But heads of state and government with whom we work closely, and on whose cooperation we depend, should feel confident that we are treating them as real partners.",6
2014-01-18,oba,And the changes I’ve ordered do just that.,3
2014-01-18,oba,"Finally, to make sure that we follow through on all these reforms, I am making some important changes to how our government is organized.",6
2014-01-18,oba,The State Department will designate a senior officer to coordinate our diplomacy on issues related to technology and signals intelligence.,6
2014-01-18,oba,We will appoint a senior official at the White House to implement the new privacy safeguards that I have announced today.,4
2014-01-18,oba,"I will devote the resources to centralize and improve the process we use to handle foreign requests for legal assistance, keeping our high standards for privacy while helping foreign partners fight crime and terrorism.",9
2014-01-18,oba,"I have also asked my counselor, John Podesta, to lead a comprehensive review of big data and privacy.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"And this group will consist of government officials who, along with the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, will reach out to privacy experts, technologists and business leaders, and look how the challenges inherent in big data are being confronted by both the public and private sectors; whether we can forge international norms on how to manage this data; and how we can continue to promote the free flow of information in ways that are consistent with both privacy and security.",10
2014-01-18,oba,"For ultimately, what’s at stake in this debate goes far beyond a few months of headlines, or passing tensions in our foreign policy.",5
2014-01-18,oba,"When you cut through the noise, what’s really at stake is how we remain true to who we are in a world that is remaking itself at dizzying speed.",10
2014-01-18,oba,"Whether it’s the ability of individuals to communicate ideas; to access information that would have once filled every great library in every country in the world; or to forge bonds with people on other sides of the globe, technology is remaking what is possible for individuals, and for institutions, and for the international order.",9
2014-01-18,oba,"So while the reforms that I have announced will point us in a new direction, I am mindful that more work will be needed in the future.",5
2014-01-18,oba,One thing I’m certain of:  This debate will make us stronger.,5
2014-01-18,oba,"And I also know that in this time of change, the United States of America will have to lead.",5
2014-01-18,oba,It may seem sometimes that America is being held to a different standard.,4
2014-01-18,oba,And I'll admit the readiness of some to assume the worst motives by our government can be frustrating.,6
2014-01-18,oba,"No one expects China to have an open debate about their surveillance programs, or Russia to take privacy concerns of citizens in other places into account.",5
2014-01-18,oba,But let’s remember:  We are held to a different standard precisely because we have been at the forefront of defending personal privacy and human dignity.,9
2014-01-18,oba,"As the nation that developed the Internet, the world expects us to ensure that the digital revolution works as a tool for individual empowerment, not government control.",8
2014-01-18,oba,"Having faced down the dangers of totalitarianism and fascism and communism, the world expects us to stand up for the principle that every person has the right to think and write and form relationships freely -- because individual freedom is the wellspring of human progress.",9
2014-01-18,oba,Those values make us who we are.,3
2014-01-18,oba,"And because of the strength of our own democracy, we should not shy away from high expectations.",5

2014-01-29,oba,"That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life.",7
2014-01-29,oba,It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs.,7

2014-01-29,oba,Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10.,7
2014-01-29,oba,This will help families.,1
2014-01-29,oba,It will give businesses customers with more money to spend.,4
2014-01-29,oba,It doesn't involve any new bureaucratic program.,2
2014-01-29,oba,So join the rest of the country.,4
2014-01-29,oba,Say yes.,1
2014-01-29,oba,Give America a raise.,2
2014-01-29,oba,"There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit.",11
2014-01-29,oba,"Right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point.",4
2014-01-29,oba,But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn't do enough for single workers who don't have kids.,6
2014-01-29,oba,"So let's work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead.",5
2014-01-29,oba,Let's do more to help Americans save for retirement.,5

2014-01-29,oba,"That's why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA.",7
2014-01-29,oba,It's a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.,5
2014-01-29,oba,MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.,7
2014-01-29,oba,"And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for middle-class Americans.",7
2014-01-29,oba,"Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.",5
2014-01-29,oba,"And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans.",9

2014-01-29,oba,"On January 6th, she had emergency surgery.",3
2014-01-29,oba,"Just one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would've meant bankruptcy.",4

2014-01-29,oba,Let's see if the numbers add up.,4

2014-01-29,oba,"Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened.",5
2014-01-29,oba,But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it; and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote.,6

2014-01-29,oba,"It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy.",5

2014-01-29,oba,"So, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks -- through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners -- America must move off a permanent war footing.",8
2014-01-29,oba,That's why I've imposed prudent limits on the use of drones -- for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.,8
2014-01-29,oba,"That's why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs -- because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated.",7
2014-01-29,oba,"And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay -- because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world.",13

2014-01-29,oba,"American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria's chemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve -- a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear.",7
2014-01-29,oba,"As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel -- a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side.",10
2014-01-29,oba,"And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran's nuclear program -- and rolled parts of that program back -- for the very first time in a decade.",6
2014-01-29,oba,"As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.",7
2014-01-29,oba,It is not installing advanced centrifuges.,2

2014-01-29,oba,These negotiations will be difficult.,2
2014-01-29,oba,They may not succeed.,1
2014-01-29,oba,"We are clear-eyed about Iran's support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away.",10
2014-01-29,oba,But these negotiations do not rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.,8
2014-01-29,oba,"If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today.",4
2014-01-29,oba,The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible.,4
2014-01-29,oba,"But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.",6
2014-01-29,oba,"For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.",5
2014-01-29,oba,"If Iran's leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon.",8
2014-01-29,oba,"But if Iran's leaders do seize the chance, then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war.",7
2014-01-29,oba,"Finally, let's remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe -- to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want.",9
2014-01-29,oba,And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America.,6
2014-01-29,oba,Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.,4

2014-01-29,oba,"And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster -- as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, ""We will never forget your kindness"" and ""God bless America!""",11
2014-01-29,oba,We do these things because they help promote our long-term security.,5

2014-01-29,oba,And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.,5
2014-01-29,oba,Let me tell you about one of those families I've come to know.,8
2014-01-29,oba,"I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-Day.",4
2014-01-29,oba,"Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program -- a strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack.",6
2014-01-29,oba,"We joked around, and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch.",4
2014-01-29,oba,"A few months later, on his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan.",4
2014-01-29,oba,"His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain.",5
2014-01-29,oba,"For months, he lay in a coma.",3
2014-01-29,oba,"The next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn't speak; he could barely move.",6
2014-01-29,oba,"Over the years, he's endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab every day.",4
2014-01-29,oba,"Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye.",3
2014-01-29,oba,He still struggles on his left side.,3
2014-01-29,oba,"But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger.",5
2014-01-29,oba,"Day by day, he's learned to speak again and stand again and walk again -- and he's working toward the day when he can serve his country again.",6
2014-01-29,oba,"""My recovery has not been easy,"" he says.",3
2014-01-29,oba,"""Nothing in life that's worth anything is easy.""",3
2014-01-29,oba,Cory is here tonight.,1
2014-01-29,oba,"And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit.",5
2014-01-29,oba,"My fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy.",4
2014-01-29,oba,"Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.",3
2014-01-29,oba,Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.,3
2014-01-29,oba,"But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress -- to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice, and fairness, and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen.",8
2014-01-29,oba,The America we want for our kids -- a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us -- none of it is easy.,10
2014-01-29,oba,"But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow -- I know it's within our reach.",5

2014-03-07,oba,"Before Jay takes some of your questions, I wanted to provide a brief update on our efforts to address the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.",8
2014-03-07,oba,"Since the Russian intervention, we've been mobilizing the international community to condemn this violation of international law and to support the people and Government of Ukraine.",6
2014-03-07,oba,This morning I signed an Executive order that authorizes sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine or for stealing the assets of the Ukrainian people.,17
2014-03-07,oba,"According to my guidance, the State Department has also put in place restrictions on the travel of certain individuals and officials.",6
2014-03-07,oba,These decisions continue our efforts to impose a cost on Russia and those responsible for the situation in Crimea.,10
2014-03-07,oba,And they also give us the flexibility to adjust our response going forward based on Russia's actions.,9
2014-03-07,oba,We took these steps in close coordination with our European allies.,5
2014-03-07,oba,"I've spoken to several of our closest friends around the world, and I'm pleased that our international unity is on display at this important moment.",7
2014-03-07,oba,"Already, we've moved together to announce substantial assistance for the Government in Kiev, and today in Brussels, our allies took similar steps to impose costs on Russia.",6
2014-03-07,oba,"I am confident that we are moving forward together, united in our determination to oppose actions that violate international law and to support the Government and people of Ukraine.",13
2014-03-07,oba,And that includes standing up for the principle of state sovereignty.,6
2014-03-07,oba,The proposed referendum on the future of Crimea would violate the Ukrainian Constitution and violate international law.,5
2014-03-07,oba,Any discussion about the future of Ukraine must include the legitimate Government of Ukraine.,5
2014-03-07,oba,"In 2014, we are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of democratic leaders.",8
2014-03-07,oba,"While we take these steps, I want to be clear that there is also a way to resolve this crisis that respects the interests of the Russian Federation, as well as the Ukrainian people.",10
2014-03-07,oba,"Let international monitors into all of Ukraine, including Crimea, to ensure the rights of all Ukrainians are being respected, including ethnic Russians.",6
2014-03-07,oba,"Begin consultations between the Government of Russia and Ukraine, with the participation of the international community.",6
2014-03-07,oba,"Russia would maintain its basing rights in Crimea, provided that it abides by its agreements and respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.",6
2014-03-07,oba,And the world should support the people of Ukraine as they move to elections in May.,3
2014-03-07,oba,"That's the path of deescalation, and Secretary Kerry is engaged in discussions with all of the relevant parties, including Russia and Ukraine, to pursue that path.",10
2014-03-07,oba,"But if this violation of international law continues, the resolve of the United States and our allies and the international community will remain firm.",6
2014-03-07,oba,"Meanwhile, we've taken steps to reaffirm our commitment to the security and democracy of our allies in Eastern Europe and to support the people of Ukraine.",10
2014-03-07,oba,One last point: There's been a lot of talk in Congress about these issues.,7
2014-03-07,oba,"Today, once again, I'm calling on Congress to follow up on these words with action, specifically to support the IMF's capacity to lend resources to Ukraine and to provide American assistance for the Ukrainian Government so that they can weather this storm and stabilize their economy, make needed reforms, deliver for their people, all of which will provide a smoother pathway for the elections that have already been scheduled in May.",9
2014-03-07,oba,Today the world can see that the United States is united with our allies and partners in upholding international law and pursuing a just outcome that advances global security and the future that the Ukrainian people deserve.,13
2014-03-07,oba,That's what we're going to continue to do in the days to come until we have seen a resolution to this crisis.,9
2014-03-07,oba,Thanks very much.,2

2014-03-26,oba,I have to admit it is easy to love a country famous for chocolate and beer.,8
2014-03-26,oba,"Leaders and dignitaries of the European Union; representatives of our NATO Alliance; distinguished guests:  We meet here at a moment of testing for Europe and the United States, and for the international order that we have worked for generations to build.",9
2014-03-26,oba,"Throughout human history, societies have grappled with fundamental questions of how to organize themselves, the proper relationship between the individual and the state, the best means to resolve inevitable conflicts between states.",6
2014-03-26,oba,"And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle -- through war and Enlightenment, repression and revolution -- that a particular set of ideals began to emerge:  The belief that through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose.",9
2014-03-26,oba,"The belief that power is derived from the consent of the governed, and that laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding.",6
2014-03-26,oba,"And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men -- and women -- are created equal.",8

2014-03-26,oba,"This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign.",6
2014-03-26,oba,"Often, this alternative vision roots itself in the notion that by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, some are inherently superior to others, and that individual identity must be defined by “us” versus “them,” or that national greatness must flow not by what a people stand for, but by what they are against.",9

2014-03-26,oba,Sentinels stood vigilant in a NATO Alliance that would become the strongest the world has ever known.,7
2014-03-26,oba,"And across the Atlantic, we embraced a shared vision of Europe -- a vision based on representative democracy, individual rights, and a belief that nations can meet the interests of their citizens through trade and open markets; a social safety net and respect for those of different faiths and backgrounds.",12
2014-03-26,oba,"For decades, this vision stood in sharp contrast to life on the other side of an Iron Curtain.",5
2014-03-26,oba,"For decades, a contest was waged, and ultimately that contest was won -- not by tanks or missiles, but because our ideals stirred the hearts of Hungarians who sparked a revolution; Poles in their shipyards who stood in Solidarity; Czechs who waged a Velvet Revolution without firing a shot; and East Berliners who marched past the guards and finally tore down that wall.",9

2014-03-26,oba,And the consequences that would arise from complacency are not abstractions.,4

2014-03-26,oba,"There was the university student, wrapped in the Ukrainian flag, expressing her hope that “every country should live by the law.”  A postgraduate student, speaking of her fellow protestors, saying, “I want these people who are here to have dignity.”  Imagine that you are the young woman who said, “there are some things that fear, police sticks and tear gas cannot destroy.”

We’ve never met these people, but we know them.",6
2014-03-26,oba,Their voices echo calls for human dignity that rang out in European streets and squares for generations.,7

2014-03-26,oba,That is what we believe.,2
2014-03-26,oba,That’s what makes us strong.,3
2014-03-26,oba,And our enduring strength is also reflected in our respect for an international system that protects the rights of both nations and people -- a United Nations and a Universal Declaration of Human Rights; international law and the means to enforce those laws.,13
2014-03-26,oba,But we also know that those rules are not self-executing; they depend on people and nations of goodwill continually affirming them.,4
2014-03-26,oba,And that’s why Russia’s violation of international law -- its assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity -- must be met with condemnation.,7
2014-03-26,oba,"Not because we’re trying to keep Russia down, but because the principles that have meant so much to Europe and the world must be lifted up.",7

2014-03-26,oba,"Together, we are imposing costs through sanctions that have left a mark on Russia and those accountable for its actions.",10
2014-03-26,oba,"And if the Russian leadership stays on its current course, together we will ensure that this isolation deepens.",4
2014-03-26,oba,Sanctions will expand.,1
2014-03-26,oba,"And the toll on Russia’s economy, as well as its standing in the world, will only increase.",5

2014-03-26,oba,"After all, unlike the Soviet Union, Russia leads no bloc of nations, no global ideology.",3
2014-03-26,oba,The United States and NATO do not seek any conflict with Russia.,3
2014-03-26,oba,"In fact, for more than 60 years, we have come together in NATO -- not to claim other lands, but to keep nations free.",4
2014-03-26,oba,"What we will do -- always -- is uphold our solemn obligation, our Article 5 duty to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our allies.",9

2014-03-26,oba,"Today, NATO planes patrol the skies over the Baltics, and we’ve reinforced our presence in Poland.",4
2014-03-26,oba,And we’re prepared to do more.,3
2014-03-26,oba,"Going forward, every NATO member state must step up and carry its share of the burden by showing the political will to invest in our collective defense, and by developing the capabilities to serve as a source of international peace and security.",9
2014-03-26,oba,"Of course, Ukraine is not a member of NATO -- in part because of its close and complex history with Russia.",4
2014-03-26,oba,Nor will Russia be dislodged from Crimea or deterred from further escalation by military force.,6
2014-03-26,oba,"But with time, so long as we remain united, the Russian people will recognize that they cannot achieve security, prosperity and the status that they seek through brute force.",6
2014-03-26,oba,"And that’s why, throughout this crisis, we will combine our substantial pressure on Russia with an open door for diplomacy.",5
2014-03-26,oba,"I believe that for both Ukraine and Russia, a stable peace will come through de-escalation -- direct dialogue between Russia and the government of Ukraine and the international community; monitors who can ensure that the rights of all Ukrainians are protected; a process of constitutional reform within Ukraine; and free and fair elections this spring.",10
2014-03-26,oba,"So far, Russia has resisted diplomatic overtures, annexing Crimea and massing large forces along Ukraine’s border.",7
2014-03-26,oba,Russia has justified these actions as an effort to prevent problems on its own borders and to protect ethnic Russians inside Ukraine.,7
2014-03-26,oba,"Of course, there is no evidence, and never has been, of systemic violence against ethnic Russians inside of Ukraine.",6
2014-03-26,oba,"Moreover, many countries around the world face similar questions about their borders and ethnic minorities abroad, about sovereignty and self-determination.",5
2014-03-26,oba,"These are tensions that have led in other places to debate and democratic referendums, conflicts and uneasy co-existence.",7
2014-03-26,oba,"These are difficult issues, and it is precisely because these questions are hard that they must be addressed through constitutional means and international laws so that majorities cannot simply suppress minorities, and big countries cannot simply bully the small.",7
2014-03-26,oba,"In defending its actions, Russian leaders have further claimed Kosovo as a precedent -- an example they say of the West interfering in the affairs of a smaller country, just as they’re doing now.",12
2014-03-26,oba,But NATO only intervened after the people of Kosovo were systematically brutalized and killed for years.,4
2014-03-26,oba,"And Kosovo only left Serbia after a referendum was organized not outside the boundaries of international law, but in careful cooperation with the United Nations and with Kosovo’s neighbors.",7
2014-03-26,oba,None of that even came close to happening in Crimea.,5
2014-03-26,oba,"Moreover, Russia has pointed to America’s decision to go into Iraq as an example of Western hypocrisy.",8
2014-03-26,oba,"Now, it is true that the Iraq War was a subject of vigorous debate not just around the world, but in the United States as well.",7
2014-03-26,oba,I participated in that debate and I opposed our military intervention there.,3
2014-03-26,oba,"But even in Iraq, America sought to work within the international system.",4
2014-03-26,oba,We did not claim or annex Iraq’s territory.,4
2014-03-26,oba,We did not grab its resources for our own gain.,3
2014-03-26,oba,"Instead, we ended our war and left Iraq to its people and a fully sovereign Iraqi state that could make decisions about its own future.",9
2014-03-26,oba,"Of course, neither the United States nor Europe are perfect in adherence to our ideals, nor do we claim to be the sole arbiter of what is right or wrong in the world.",8
2014-03-26,oba,"We are human, after all, and we face difficult choices about how to exercise our power.",6
2014-03-26,oba,"But part of what makes us different is that we welcome criticism, just as we welcome the responsibilities that come with global leadership.",7
2014-03-26,oba,"We look to the East and the South and see nations poised to play a growing role on the world stage, and we consider that a good thing.",7
2014-03-26,oba,It reflects the same diversity that makes us stronger as a nation and the forces of integration and cooperation that Europe has advanced for decades.,9
2014-03-26,oba,"And in a world of challenges that are increasingly global, all of us have an interest in nations stepping forward to play their part -- to bear their share of the burden and to uphold international norms.",7
2014-03-26,oba,So our approach stands in stark contrast to the arguments coming out of Russia these days.,8
2014-03-26,oba,It is absurd to suggest -- as a steady drumbeat of Russian voices do -- that America is somehow conspiring with fascists inside of Ukraine or failing to respect the Russian people.,6
2014-03-26,oba,"My grandfather served in Patton’s Army, just as many of your fathers and grandfathers fought against fascism.",5
2014-03-26,oba,"We Americans remember well the unimaginable sacrifices made by the Russian people in World War II, and we have honored those sacrifices.",7
2014-03-26,oba,"Since the end of the Cold War, we have worked with Russia under successive administrations to build ties of culture and commerce and international community not as a favor to Russia, but because it was in our national interests.",7
2014-03-26,oba,"And together, we’ve secured nuclear materials from terrorists.",2
2014-03-26,oba,We welcomed Russia into the G8 and the World Trade Organization.,4
2014-03-26,oba,"From the reduction of nuclear arms to the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons, we believe the world has benefited when Russia chooses to cooperate on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect.",9
2014-03-26,oba,"So America, and the world and Europe, has an interest in a strong and responsible Russia, not a weak one.",5
2014-03-26,oba,"We want the Russian people to live in security, prosperity and dignity like everyone else -- proud of their own history.",9
2014-03-26,oba,But that does not mean that Russia can run roughshod over its neighbors.,4
2014-03-26,oba,Just because Russia has a deep history with Ukraine does not mean it should be able to dictate Ukraine’s future.,6
2014-03-26,oba,No amount of propaganda can make right something that the world knows is wrong.,4
2014-03-26,oba,"In the end, every society must chart its own course.",3
2014-03-26,oba,America’s path or Europe’s path is not the only ways to reach freedom and justice.,4
2014-03-26,oba,But on the fundamental principle that is at stake here -- the ability of nations and peoples to make their own choices -- there can be no going back.,5
2014-03-26,oba,It’s not America that filled the Maidan with protesters -- it was Ukrainians.,4
2014-03-26,oba,No foreign forces compelled the citizens of Tunis and Tripoli to rise up -- they did so on their own.,5
2014-03-26,oba,"From the Burmese parliamentarian pursuing reform to the young leaders fighting corruption and intolerance in Africa, we see something irreducible that all of us share as human beings -- a truth that will persevere in the face of violence and repression and will ultimately overcome.",12
2014-03-26,oba,"For the young people here today, I know it may seem easy to see these events as removed from our lives, remote from our daily routines, distant from concerns closer to home.",11
2014-03-26,oba,I recognize that both in the United States and in much of Europe there’s more than enough to worry about in the affairs of our own countries.,7
2014-03-26,oba,"There will always be voices who say that what happens in the wider world is not our concern, nor our responsibility.",7
2014-03-26,oba,But we must never forget that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom.,6
2014-03-26,oba,"Our democracy, our individual opportunity only exists because those who came before us had the wisdom and the courage to recognize that our ideals will only endure if we see our self-interest in the success of other peoples and other nations.",13
2014-03-26,oba,Now is not the time for bluster.,3
2014-03-26,oba,"The situation in Ukraine, like crises in many parts of the world, does not have easy answers nor a military solution.",8
2014-03-26,oba,"But at this moment, we must meet the challenge to our ideals -- to our very international order -- with strength and conviction.",5
2014-03-26,oba,"And it is you, the young people of Europe, young people like Laura, who will help decide which way the currents of our history will flow.",10
2014-03-26,oba,"Do not think for a moment that your own freedom, your own prosperity, that your own moral imagination is bound by the limits of your community, your ethnicity, or even your country.",9
2014-03-26,oba,You’re bigger than that.,3
2014-03-26,oba,You can help us to choose a better history.,3
2014-03-26,oba,That’s what Europe tells us.,2
2014-03-26,oba,That’s what the American experience is all about.,3
2014-03-26,oba,"I say this as the President of a country that looked to Europe for the values that are written into our founding documents, and which spilled blood to ensure that those values could endure on these shores.",11
2014-03-26,oba,"I also say this as the son of a Kenyan whose grandfather was a cook for the British, and as a person who once lived in Indonesia as it emerged from colonialism.",9
2014-03-26,oba,"The ideals that unite us matter equally to the young people of Boston or Brussels, or Jakarta or Nairobi, or Krakow or Kyiv.",7
2014-03-26,oba,"In the end, the success of our ideals comes down to us -- including the example of our own lives, our own societies.",6
2014-03-26,oba,We know that there will always be intolerance.,2
2014-03-26,oba,"But instead of fearing the immigrant, we can welcome him.",4

2014-03-26,oba,"Instead of defining ourselves in opposition to others, we can affirm the aspirations that we hold in common.",6
2014-03-26,oba,That’s what will make America strong.,3
2014-03-26,oba,That’s what will make Europe strong.,3
2014-03-26,oba,That’s what makes us who we are.,4
2014-03-26,oba,"And just as we meet our responsibilities as individuals, we must be prepared to meet them as nations.",4
2014-03-26,oba,Because we live in a world in which our ideals are going to be challenged again and again by forces that would drag us back into conflict or corruption.,10
2014-03-26,oba,We can’t count on others to rise to meet those tests.,4
2014-03-26,oba,"The policies of your government, the principles of your European Union, will make a critical difference in whether or not the international order that so many generations before you have strived to create continues to move forward, or whether it retreats.",7
2014-03-26,oba,"And that’s the question we all must answer -- what kind of Europe, what kind of America, what kind of world will we leave behind.",6
2014-03-26,oba,"And I believe that if we hold firm to our principles, and are willing to back our beliefs with courage and resolve, then hope will ultimately overcome fear, and freedom will continue to triumph over tyranny -- because that is what forever stirs in the human heart.",8
2014-03-26,oba,Thank you very much.,2

2014-04-11,oba,And Michelle was in particular interested to -- of a recording in which Lady Bird is critiquing President Johnson’s performance.,8
2014-04-11,oba,"And she said, come, come, you need to listen to this.",4
2014-04-11,oba,And she pressed the button and nodded her head.,3

2014-04-11,oba,"Four days into his sudden presidency -- and the night before he would address a joint session of the Congress in which he once served -- Lyndon Johnson sat around a table with his closest advisors, preparing his remarks to a shattered and grieving nation.",7
2014-04-11,oba,He wanted to call on senators and representatives to pass a civil rights bill -- the most sweeping since Reconstruction.,6
2014-04-11,oba,And most of his staff counseled him against it.,4
2014-04-11,oba,They said it was hopeless; that it would anger powerful Southern Democrats and committee chairmen; that it risked derailing the rest of his domestic agenda.,5
2014-04-11,oba,"And one particularly bold aide said he did not believe a President should spend his time and power on lost causes, however worthy they might be.",5
2014-04-11,oba,"To which, it is said, President Johnson replied, “Well, what the hell’s the presidency for?”1  What the hell’s the presidency for if not to fight for causes you believe in?",7

2014-04-11,oba,"But we also gather here, deep in the heart of the state that shaped him, to recall one giant man’s remarkable efforts to make real the promise of our founding:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

Those of us who have had the singular privilege to hold the office of the Presidency know well that progress in this country can be hard and it can be slow, frustrating and sometimes you’re stymied.",7

2014-04-11,oba,"But the presidency also affords a unique opportunity to bend those currents -- by shaping our laws and by shaping our debates; by working within the confines of the world as it is, but also by reimagining the world as it should be.",7
2014-04-11,oba,This was President Johnson’s genius.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"As a master of politics and the legislative process, he grasped like few others the power of government to bring about change.",4

2014-04-11,oba,He was well aware that the law alone isn’t enough to change hearts and minds.,6
2014-04-11,oba,"A full century after Lincoln’s time, he said,

    Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men’s skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact.2

He understood laws couldn’t accomplish everything.",10
2014-04-11,oba,"But he also knew that only the law could anchor change, and set hearts and minds on a different course.",5
2014-04-11,oba,And a lot of Americans needed the law’s most basic protections at that time.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"As Dr. King said at the time,

    It may be true that the law can’t make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important.3

And passing laws was what LBJ knew how to do.",5
2014-04-11,oba,No one knew politics and no one loved legislating more than President Johnson.,6
2014-04-11,oba,"He was charming when he needed to be, ruthless when required.",4
2014-04-11,oba,He could wear you down with logic and argument.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"He could horse trade, and he could flatter.",2
2014-04-11,oba,"You come with me on this bill,” he would reportedly tell a key Republican leader from my home state during the fight for the Civil Rights Bill, “and 200 years from now, schoolchildren will know only two names: Abraham Lincoln and Everett Dirksen And he knew that senators would believe things like that.",6
2014-04-11,oba,President Johnson liked power.,2
2014-04-11,oba,"He liked the feel of it, the wielding of it.",4
2014-04-11,oba,"But that hunger was harnessed and redeemed by a deeper understanding of the human condition; by a sympathy for the underdog, for the downtrodden, for the outcast.",6
2014-04-11,oba,And it was a sympathy rooted in his own experience.,5
2014-04-11,oba,"As a young boy growing up in the Texas Hill Country, Johnson knew what being poor felt like.",5
2014-04-11,oba,"“Poverty was so common,” he would later say, “we didn’t even know it had a name.”  The family home didn’t have electricity or indoor plumbing.",4
2014-04-11,oba,"Everybody worked hard, including the children.",3
2014-04-11,oba,"President Johnson had known the metallic taste of hunger; the feel of a mother’s calloused hands, rubbed raw from washing and cleaning and holding a household together.",9
2014-04-11,oba,"His cousin Ava remembered sweltering days spent on her hands and knees in the cotton fields, with Lyndon whispering beside her, “Boy, there’s got to be a better way to make a living than this.",7
2014-04-11,oba,"There’s got to be a better way.”4

It wasn’t until years later when he was teaching at a so-called Mexican school in a tiny town in Texas that he came to understand how much worse the persistent pain of poverty could be for other races in a Jim Crow South.",3
2014-04-11,oba,Oftentimes his students would show up to class hungry.,4
2014-04-11,oba,"And when he’d visit their homes, he’d meet fathers who were paid slave wages by the farmers they worked for.",6
2014-04-11,oba,"Those children were taught, he would later say, “that the end of life is in a beet row, a spinach field, or a cotton patch.” 

Deprivation and discrimination -- these were not abstractions to Lyndon Baines Johnson.",6
2014-04-11,oba,He knew that poverty and injustice are as inseparable as opportunity and justice are joined.,5
2014-04-11,oba,So that was in him from an early age.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"Now, like any of us, he was not a perfect man.",4
2014-04-11,oba,"His experiences in rural Texas may have stretched his moral imagination, but he was ambitious, very ambitious, a young man in a hurry to plot his own escape from poverty and to chart his own political career.",8
2014-04-11,oba,"And in the Jim Crow South, that meant not challenging convention.",3
2014-04-11,oba,"During his first 20 years in Congress, he opposed every civil rights bill that came up for a vote, once calling the push for federal legislation “a farce and a sham.”  He was chosen as a vice presidential nominee in part because of his affinity with, and ability to deliver, that Southern white vote.",7
2014-04-11,oba,"And at the beginning of the Kennedy administration, he shared with President Kennedy a caution towards racial controversy.",5
2014-04-11,oba,But marchers kept marching.,1
2014-04-11,oba,Four little girls were killed in a church.,3
2014-04-11,oba,Bloody Sunday happened.,2
2014-04-11,oba,The winds of change blew.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"And when the time came, when LBJ stood in the Oval Office -- I picture him standing there, taking up the entire doorframe, looking out over the South Lawn in a quiet moment -- and asked himself what the true purpose of his office was for, what was the endpoint of his ambitions, he would reach back in his own memory and he’d remember his own experience with want.",6
2014-04-11,oba,"And he knew that he had a unique capacity, as the most powerful white politician from the South, to not merely challenge the convention that had crushed the dreams of so many, but to ultimately dismantle for good the structures of legal segregation.",8
2014-04-11,oba,"He’s the only guy who could do it -- and he knew there would be a cost, famously saying the Democratic Party may “have lost the South for a generation.”5 

That’s what his presidency was for.",7
2014-04-11,oba,That’s where he meets his moment.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"And possessed with an iron will, possessed with those skills that he had honed so many years in Congress, pushed and supported by a movement of those willing to sacrifice everything for their own liberation, President Johnson fought for and argued and horse traded and bullied and persuaded until ultimately he signed the Civil Rights Act into law.",11
2014-04-11,oba,"And he didn’t stop there -- even though his advisors again told him to wait, again told him let the dust settle, let the country absorb this momentous decision.",5
2014-04-11,oba,He shook them off.,1
2014-04-11,oba,"“The meat in the coconut,” as President Johnson would put it, was the Voting Rights Act, so he fought for and passed that as well.",5
2014-04-11,oba,Immigration reform came shortly after.,2
2014-04-11,oba,"And then, a Fair Housing Act.",2
2014-04-11,oba,"And then, a health care law that opponents described as “socialized medicine” that would curtail America’s freedom, but ultimately freed millions of seniors from the fear that illness could rob them of dignity and security in their golden years, which we now know today as Medicare.",9
2014-04-11,oba,What President Johnson understood was that equality required more than the absence of oppression.,6
2014-04-11,oba,It required the presence of economic opportunity.,4
2014-04-11,oba,"He wouldn’t be as eloquent as Dr. King would be in describing that linkage, as Dr. King moved into mobilizing sanitation workers and a poor people’s movement, but he understood that connection because he had lived it.",7
2014-04-11,oba,"A decent job, decent wages, health care -- those, too, were civil rights worth fighting for.",4
2014-04-11,oba,"An economy where hard work is rewarded and success is shared, that was his goal.",4
2014-04-11,oba,"And he knew, as someone who had seen the New Deal transform the landscape of his Texas childhood, who had seen the difference electricity had made because of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the transformation concretely day in and day out in the life of his own family, he understood that government had a role to play in broadening prosperity to all those who would strive for it.",13
2014-04-11,oba,"“We want to open the gates to opportunity,” President Johnson said, “But we are also going to give all our people, black and white, the help they need to walk through those gates.”6

Now, if some of this sounds familiar, it’s because today we remain locked in this same great debate about equality and opportunity, and the role of government in ensuring each.",7
2014-04-11,oba,"As was true 50 years ago, there are those who dismiss the Great Society as a failed experiment and an encroachment on liberty; who argue that government has become the true source of all that ails us, and that poverty is due to the moral failings of those who suffer from it.",11
2014-04-11,oba,"There are also those who argue, John, that nothing has changed; that racism is so embedded in our DNA that there is no use trying politics -- the game is rigged.",5
2014-04-11,oba,But such theories ignore history.,2
2014-04-11,oba,"Yes, it’s true that, despite laws like the Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act and Medicare, our society is still racked with division and poverty.",7
2014-04-11,oba,"Yes, race still colors our political debates, and there have been government programs that have fallen short.",4
2014-04-11,oba,"In a time when cynicism is too often passed off as wisdom, it’s perhaps easy to conclude that there are limits to change; that we are trapped by our own history; and politics is a fool’s errand, and we’d be better off if we roll back big chunks of LBJ’s legacy, or at least if we don’t put too much of our hope, invest too much of our hope in our government.",11
2014-04-11,oba,I reject such thinking.,2
2014-04-11,oba,Not just because Medicare and Medicaid have lifted millions from suffering; not just because the poverty rate in this nation would be far worse without food stamps and Head Start and all the Great Society programs that survive to this day.,8
2014-04-11,oba,I reject such cynicism because I have lived out the promise of LBJ’s efforts.,6
2014-04-11,oba,Because Michelle has lived out the legacy of those efforts.,4
2014-04-11,oba,Because my daughters have lived out the legacy of those efforts.,4
2014-04-11,oba,Because I and millions of my generation were in a position to take the baton that he handed to us.,7
2014-04-11,oba,"Because of the Civil Rights movement, because of the laws President Johnson signed, new doors of opportunity and education swung open for everybody -- not all at once, but they swung open.",5
2014-04-11,oba,"Not just blacks and whites, but also women and Latinos; and Asians and Native Americans; and gay Americans and Americans with a disability.",4
2014-04-11,oba,"They swung open for you, and they swung open for me.",3
2014-04-11,oba,"And that’s why I’m standing here today -- because of those efforts, because of that legacy.",4
2014-04-11,oba,And that means we’ve got a debt to pay.,4
2014-04-11,oba,That means we can’t afford to be cynical.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"Half a century later, the laws LBJ passed are now as fundamental to our conception of ourselves and our democracy as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.",11
2014-04-11,oba,They are foundational; an essential piece of the American character.,3
2014-04-11,oba,But we are here today because we know we cannot be complacent.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"For history travels not only forwards; history can travel backwards, history can travel sideways.",5
2014-04-11,oba,And securing the gains this country has made requires the vigilance of its citizens.,5
2014-04-11,oba,"Our rights, our freedoms -- they are not given.",3
2014-04-11,oba,They must be won.,1
2014-04-11,oba,"They must be nurtured through struggle and discipline, and persistence and faith.",3
2014-04-11,oba,"And one concern I have sometimes during these moments, the celebration of the signing of the Civil Rights Act, the March on Washington -- from a distance, sometimes these commemorations seem inevitable, they seem easy.",9
2014-04-11,oba,All the pain and difficulty and struggle and doubt -- all that is rubbed away.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"And we look at ourselves and we say, oh, things are just too different now;  we couldn’t possibly do what was done then -- these giants, what they accomplished.",6
2014-04-11,oba,"And yet, they were men and women, too.",2
2014-04-11,oba,It wasn’t easy then.,1
2014-04-11,oba,It wasn’t certain then.,1
2014-04-11,oba,"Still, the story of America is a story of progress.",3
2014-04-11,oba,"However slow, however incomplete, however harshly challenged at each point on our journey, however flawed our leaders, however many times we have to take a quarter of a loaf or half a loaf -- the story of America is a story of progress.",7
2014-04-11,oba,And that’s true because of men like President Lyndon Baines Johnson.,5
2014-04-11,oba,"In so many ways, he embodied America, with all our gifts and all our flaws, in all our restlessness and all our big dreams.",4
2014-04-11,oba,"This man -- born into poverty, weaned in a world full of racial hatred -- somehow found within himself the ability to connect his experience with the brown child in a small Texas town; the white child in Appalachia; the black child in Watts.",7
2014-04-11,oba,"As powerful as he became in that Oval Office, he understood them.",5
2014-04-11,oba,He understood what it meant to be on the outside.,5
2014-04-11,oba,And he believed that their plight was his plight too; that his freedom ultimately was wrapped up in theirs; and that making their lives better was what the hell the presidency was for.,4
2014-04-11,oba,"And those children were on his mind when he strode to the podium that night in the House Chamber, when he called for the vote on the Civil Rights law.",8
2014-04-11,oba,"“It never occurred to me,” he said, “in my fondest dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students” that he had taught so many years ago, “and to help people like them all over this country.",9
2014-04-11,oba,But now I do have that chance.,2
2014-04-11,oba,And I’ll let you in on a secret -- I mean to use it.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"And I hope that you will use it with me.”7

That was LBJ’s greatness.",3
2014-04-11,oba,That’s why we remember him.,2
2014-04-11,oba,"And if there is one thing that he and this year’s anniversary should teach us, if there’s one lesson I hope that Malia and Sasha and young people everywhere learn from this day, it’s that with enough effort, and enough empathy, and enough perseverance, and enough courage, people who love their country can change it.",8
2014-04-11,oba,"In his final year, President Johnson stood on this stage, racked with pain, battered by the controversies of Vietnam, looking far older than his 64 years, and he delivered what would be his final public speech.",6
2014-04-11,oba,"“We have proved that great progress is possible,” he said.",4
2014-04-11,oba,“We know how much still remains to be done.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"And if our efforts continue, and if our will is strong, and if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then, my fellow Americans, I am confident, we shall overcome.”

We shall overcome.",5
2014-04-11,oba,"We, the citizens of the United States.",4
2014-04-11,oba,"Like Dr. King, like Abraham Lincoln, like countless citizens who have driven this country inexorably forward, President Johnson knew that ours in the end is a story of optimism, a story of achievement and constant striving that is unique upon this Earth.",8
2014-04-11,oba,He knew because he had lived that story.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"He believed that together we can build an America that is more fair, more equal, and more free than the one we inherited.",9
2014-04-11,oba,He believed we make our own destiny.,3
2014-04-11,oba,"And in part because of him, we must believe it as well.",4
2014-04-11,oba,Thank you.,1
2014-04-11,oba,God bless you.,1
2014-04-11,oba,God bless the United States of America.,3
2014-05-21,oba," Good morning, everybody.",2
2014-05-21,oba,"I just met with Secretary Shinseki and Rob Nabors, who I’ve temporarily assigned to work with Secretary Shinseki and the VA.  We focused on two issues:  the allegations of misconduct at Veterans Affairs facilities, and our broader mission of caring for our veterans and their families.",9
2014-05-21,oba,"As Commander-in-Chief, I have the honor of standing with our men and women in uniform at every step of their service: from the moment they take their oath, to when our troops prepare to deploy, to Afghanistan -- where they put their lives on the line for our security, to their bedside, as our wounded warriors fight to recover from terrible injuries.",10
2014-05-21,oba,"The most searing moments of my presidency have been going to Walter Reed, or Bethesda, or Bagram and meeting troops who have left a part of themselves on the battlefield.",10
2014-05-21,oba,And their spirit and their determination to recover and often to serve again is an inspiration.,5
2014-05-21,oba,So these men and women and their families are the best that our country has to offer.,4
2014-05-21,oba,"They’ve done their duty, and they ask nothing more than that this country does ours -- that we uphold our sacred trust to all who have served.",6
2014-05-21,oba,"So when I hear allegations of misconduct -- any misconduct -- whether it’s allegations of VA staff covering up long wait times or cooking the books, I will not stand for it.",9
2014-05-21,oba,"Not as Commander-in-Chief, but also not as an American.",3
2014-05-21,oba,None of us should.,3
2014-05-21,oba,"So if these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it -- period.",4
2014-05-21,oba,Here’s what I discussed with Secretary Shinseki this morning.,4
2014-05-21,oba,"First, anybody found to have manipulated or falsified records at VA facilities has to be held accountable.",5
2014-05-21,oba,The inspector general at the VA has launched investigations into the Phoenix VA and other facilities.,4
2014-05-21,oba,And some individuals have already been put on administrative leave.,3
2014-05-21,oba,I know that people are angry and want a swift reckoning.,4
2014-05-21,oba,I sympathize with that.,2
2014-05-21,oba,But we have to let the investigators do their job and get to the bottom of what happened.,8
2014-05-21,oba,Our veterans deserve to know the facts.,3
2014-05-21,oba,Their families deserve to know the facts.,3
2014-05-21,oba,"And once we know the facts, I assure you -- if there is misconduct, it will be punished.",3
2014-05-21,oba,"Second, I want to know the full scope of this problem.",5
2014-05-21,oba,And that’s why I ordered Secretary Shinseki to investigate.,3
2014-05-21,oba,"Today, he updated me on his review, which is looking not just at the Phoenix facility, but also VA facilities across the nation.",6
2014-05-21,oba,And I expect preliminary results from that review next week.,4
2014-05-21,oba,"Third, I’ve directed Rob Nabors to conduct a broader review of the Veterans Health Administration -- the part of the VA that delivers health care to our veterans.",7
2014-05-21,oba,And Rob is going to Phoenix today.,2
2014-05-21,oba,"Keep in mind, though, even if we had not heard reports out of this Phoenix facility or other facilities, we all know that it often takes too long for veterans to get the care that they need.",7
2014-05-21,oba,That’s not a new development.,2
2014-05-21,oba,It’s been a problem for decades and it’s been compounded by more than a decade of war.,5
2014-05-21,oba,"That’s why, when I came into office, I said we would systematically work to fix these problems, and we have been working really hard to address them.",5
2014-05-21,oba,"My attitude is, for folks who have been fighting on the battlefield, they should not have to fight a bureaucracy at home to get the care that they’ve earned.",7
2014-05-21,oba,So the presumption has always been we’ve got to do better.,3
2014-05-21,oba,And Rob’s review will be a comprehensive look at the Veterans Health Administration’s approach currently to access to care.,5
2014-05-21,oba,I want to know what’s working.,3
2014-05-21,oba,I want to know what is not working.,3
2014-05-21,oba,And I want specific recommendations on how VA can up their game.,5
2014-05-21,oba,And I expect that full report from Rob next month.,3
2014-05-21,oba,"Number four -- I said that I expect everyone involved to work with Congress, which has an important oversight role to play.",9
2014-05-21,oba,"And I welcome Congress as a partner in our efforts not just to address the current controversies, but to make sure we’re doing right by our veterans across the board.",7
2014-05-21,oba,"I served on the Veterans Affairs Committee when I was in the Senate, and it was one of the proudest pieces of business that I did in the legislature.",8
2014-05-21,oba,And I know the folks over there care deeply about our veterans.,4
2014-05-21,oba,"It is important that our veterans don’t become another political football, especially when so many of them are receiving care right now.",5
2014-05-21,oba,This is an area where Democrats and Republicans should always be working together.,4
2014-05-21,oba,Which brings me to my final point.,3
2014-05-21,oba,"Even as we get to the bottom of what happened at Phoenix and other facilities, all of us, whether here in Washington or all across the country, have to stay focused on the larger mission, which is upholding our sacred trust to all of our veterans, bringing the VA system into the 21st century -- which is not an easy task.",11
2014-05-21,oba,We have made progress over the last five years.,3
2014-05-21,oba,We’ve made historic investments in our veterans.,4
2014-05-21,oba,We’ve boosted VA funding to record levels.,3
2014-05-21,oba,And we created consistency through advanced appropriations so that veterans organizations knew their money would be there regardless of political wrangling in Washington.,7
2014-05-21,oba,We made VA benefits available to more than 2 million veterans who did not have it before -- delivering disability pay to more Vietnam vets exposed to Agent Orange; making it easier for veterans with post-traumatic stress and mental health issues and traumatic brain injury to get treatment; and improving care for women veterans.,10
2014-05-21,oba,"Because of these steps and the influx of new veterans requiring services added in many cases to wait times, we launched an all-out war on the disability claims backlog.",11
2014-05-21,oba,"And in just the past year alone, we’ve slashed that backlog by half.",3
2014-05-21,oba,"Of course, we’re not going to let up, because it’s still too high.",3
2014-05-21,oba,We’re going to keep at it until we eliminate the backlog once and for all.,5
2014-05-21,oba,"Meanwhile, we’re also reducing homelessness among our veterans.",3
2014-05-21,oba,We’re helping veterans and their families -- more than a million so far -- pursue their education under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.,4
2014-05-21,oba,We’re stepping up our efforts to help our newest veterans get the skills and training to find jobs when they come home.,6
2014-05-21,oba,"And along with Michelle and Jill Biden and Joining Forces, we’ve helped hundreds of thousands of veterans find a job.",6
2014-05-21,oba,"More veterans are finding work and veterans unemployment, although still way too high, is coming down.",2
2014-05-21,oba,"The point is, caring for our veterans is not an issue that popped up in recent weeks.",6
2014-05-21,oba,"Some of the problems with respect to how veterans are able to access the benefits that they’ve earned, that’s not a new issue.",12
2014-05-21,oba,That’s an issue that I was working on when I was running for the United States Senate.,7
2014-05-21,oba,"Taking care of our veterans and their families has been one of the causes of my presidency, and it is something that all of us have to be involved with and have to be paying attention to.",7
2014-05-21,oba,We ended the war in Iraq.,3
2014-05-21,oba,"And as our war in Afghanistan ends, and as our newest veterans are coming home, the demands on the VA are going to grow.",5
2014-05-21,oba,So we’re going to have to redouble our efforts to get it right as a nation.,8
2014-05-21,oba,And we have to be honest that there are and will continue to be areas where we’ve got to do a lot better.,11
2014-05-21,oba,"So today, I want every veteran to know we are going to fix whatever is wrong.",5
2014-05-21,oba,"And so long as I have the privilege of serving as Commander-in-Chief, I’m going to keep on fighting to deliver the care and the benefits and the opportunities that your families deserve, now and for decades to come.",9
2014-05-21,oba,That is a commitment to which I feel a sacred duty to maintain.,5
2014-07-01,oba,"Good afternoon, everybody.",2
2014-07-01,oba,"One year ago this month, senators of both parties –- with support from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities –- came together to pass a commonsense immigration bill.",8
2014-07-01,oba,"Independent experts said that bill would strengthen our borders, grow our economy, shrink our deficits.",4
2014-07-01,oba,"As we speak, there are enough Republicans and Democrats in the House to pass an immigration bill today.",4
2014-07-01,oba,"I would sign it into law today, and Washington would solve a problem in a bipartisan way.",4
2014-07-01,oba,"But for more than a year, Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to allow an up-or-down vote on that Senate bill or any legislation to fix our broken immigration system.",6
2014-07-01,oba,And I held off on pressuring them for a long time to give Speaker Boehner the space he needed to get his fellow Republicans on board.,10
2014-07-01,oba,"Meanwhile, here’s what a year of obstruction has meant.",4
2014-07-01,oba,It has meant fewer resources to strengthen our borders.,3
2014-07-01,oba,"It’s meant more businesses free to game the system by hiring undocumented workers, which punishes businesses that play by the rules, and drives down wages for hardworking Americans.",11
2014-07-01,oba,It’s meant lost talent when the best and brightest from around the world come to study here but are forced to leave and then compete against our businesses and our workers.,9
2014-07-01,oba,"It’s meant no chance for 11 million immigrants to come out of the shadows and earn their citizenship if they pay a penalty and pass a background check, pay their fair share of taxes, learn English, and go to the back of the line.",8
2014-07-01,oba,It’s meant the heartbreak of separated families.,4
2014-07-01,oba,That’s what this obstruction has meant over the past year.,4
2014-07-01,oba,That’s what the Senate bill would fix if the House allowed it to go to a vote.,6
2014-07-01,oba,"Our country and our economy would be stronger today if House Republicans had allowed a simple yes-or-no vote on this bill or, for that matter, any bill.",5
2014-07-01,oba,They’d be following the will of the majority of the American people who support reform.,7
2014-07-01,oba,"Instead, they’ve proven again and again that they’re unwilling to stand up to the tea party in order to do what’s best for the country.",10
2014-07-01,oba,And the worst part about it is a bunch of them know better.,3
2014-07-01,oba,We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.,8
2014-07-01,oba,"In recent weeks, we’ve seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and traffickers.",7
2014-07-01,oba,The journey is unbelievably dangerous for these kids.,4
2014-07-01,oba,"The children who are fortunate enough to survive it will be taken care of while they go through the legal process, but in most cases that process will lead to them being sent back home.",5
2014-07-01,oba,I’ve sent a clear message to parents in these countries not to put their kids through this.,5
2014-07-01,oba,I recently sent Vice President Biden to meet with Central American leaders and find ways to address the root causes of this crisis.,8
2014-07-01,oba,Secretary Kerry will also be meeting with those leaders again tomorrow.,3
2014-07-01,oba,"With our international partners, we’re taking new steps to go after the dangerous smugglers who are putting thousands of children’s lives at risk.",9
2014-07-01,oba,"Today, I sent a letter to congressional leaders asking that they work with me to address the urgent humanitarian challenge on the border, and support the immigration and Border Patrol agents who already apprehend and deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants every year.",11
2014-07-01,oba,"And understand, by the way, for the most part, this is not a situation where these children are slipping through.",4
2014-07-01,oba,They’re being apprehended.,1
2014-07-01,oba,"But the problem is, is that our system is so broken, so unclear that folks don’t know what the rules are.",7
2014-07-01,oba,"Now, understand –- there are a number of Republicans who have been willing to work with us to pass real, commonsense immigration reform, and I want to thank them for their efforts.",10
2014-07-01,oba,There are a number of Republican leaders in the Senate who did excellent work and deserve our thanks.,7
2014-07-01,oba,"And less visibly, there have been folks in the House who have been trying to work to get this done.",6
2014-07-01,oba,"And quietly, because it doesn’t always help me to praise them, I’ve expressed to them how much I appreciate the efforts that they’ve made.",4
2014-07-01,oba,I believe Speaker Boehner when he says he wants to pass an immigration bill.,5
2014-07-01,oba,I think he genuinely wants to get something done.,4
2014-07-01,oba,"But last week, he informed me that Republicans will continue to block a vote on immigration reform at least for the remainder of this year.",7
2014-07-01,oba,Some in the House Republican Caucus are using the situation with unaccompanied children as their newest excuse to do nothing.,4
2014-07-01,oba,"Now, I want everybody to think about that.",3
2014-07-01,oba,"Their argument seems to be that because the system is broken, we shouldn’t make an effort to fix it.",5
2014-07-01,oba,It makes no sense.,2
2014-07-01,oba,It’s not on the level.,3
2014-07-01,oba,"It’s just politics, plain and simple.",3
2014-07-01,oba,"Now, there are others in the Republican Caucus in the House who are arguing that they can’t act because they’re mad at me about using my executive authority too broadly.",9
2014-07-01,oba,This also makes no sense.,2
2014-07-01,oba,I don’t prefer taking administrative action.,3
2014-07-01,oba,I’d rather see permanent fixes to the issue we face.,4
2014-07-01,oba,Certainly that’s true on immigration.,2
2014-07-01,oba,I’ve made that clear multiple times.,2
2014-07-01,oba,"I would love nothing more than bipartisan legislation to pass the House, the Senate, land on my desk so I can sign it.",8
2014-07-01,oba,"That’s true about immigration, that’s true about the minimum wage, it’s true about equal pay.",5
2014-07-01,oba,There are a whole bunch of things where I would greatly prefer Congress actually do something.,6
2014-07-01,oba,"I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing.",3
2014-07-01,oba,"And in this situation, the failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, it’s bad for our economy, and it’s bad for our future.",5
2014-07-01,oba,So while I will continue to push House Republicans to drop the excuses and act –- and I hope their constituents will too -– America cannot wait forever for them to act.,6
2014-07-01,oba,"And that’s why, today, I’m beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress.",7
2014-07-01,oba,"As a first step, I’m directing the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to move available and appropriate resources from our interior to the border.",4
2014-07-01,oba,"Protecting public safety and deporting dangerous criminals has been and will remain the top priority, but we are going to refocus our efforts where we can to make sure we do what it takes to keep our border secure.",9
2014-07-01,oba,"I have also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.",11
2014-07-01,oba,"If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours.",3
2014-07-01,oba,I expect their recommendations before the end of summer and I intend to adopt those recommendations without further delay.,5
2014-07-01,oba,"Of course, even with aggressive steps on my part, administrative action alone will not adequately address the problem.",6
2014-07-01,oba,"The reforms that will do the most to strengthen our businesses, our workers, and our entire economy will still require an act of Congress.",7
2014-07-01,oba,And I repeat:  These are reforms that already enjoy the wide support of the American people.,7
2014-07-01,oba,"It’s very rare where you get labor, business, evangelicals, law enforcement all agreeing on what needs to be done.",7
2014-07-01,oba,"And at some point, that should be enough.",3
2014-07-01,oba,"Normally, that is enough.",1
2014-07-01,oba,The point of public service is to solve public problems.,4
2014-07-01,oba,And those of us who have the privilege to serve have a responsibility to do everything in our power to keep Americans safe and to keep the doors of opportunity open.,7
2014-07-01,oba,"And if we do, then one year from now, not only would our economy and our security be stronger, but maybe the best and the brightest from around the world who come study here would stay and create jobs here.",8
2014-07-01,oba,Maybe companies that play by the rules will no longer be undercut by companies that don’t.,5
2014-07-01,oba,"Maybe more families who’ve been living here for years, whose children are often U.S. citizens, who are our neighbors and our friends, whose children are our kids’ friends and go to school with them, and play on ball teams with them, maybe those families would get to stay together.",15
2014-07-01,oba,But much of this only happens if Americans continue to push Congress to get this done.,5
2014-07-01,oba,"So I’ve told Speaker Boehner that even as I take those steps that I can within my existing legal authorities to make the immigration system work better, I’m going to continue to reach out to House Republicans in the hope that they deliver a more permanent solution with a comprehensive bill.",10
2014-07-01,oba,"Maybe it will be after the midterms, when they’re less worried about politics.",6
2014-07-01,oba,Maybe it will be next year.,2
2014-07-01,oba,"Whenever it is, they will find me a willing partner.",2
2014-07-01,oba,I have been consistent in saying that I am prepared to work with them even on a bill that I don't consider perfect.,11
2014-07-01,oba,And the Senate bill was a good example of the capacity to compromise and get this done.,7
2014-07-01,oba,The only thing I can’t do is stand by and do nothing while waiting for them to get their act together.,5
2014-07-01,oba,And I want to repeat what I said earlier.,3
2014-07-01,oba,"If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is passing bills.",7
2014-07-01,oba,Pass a bill; solve a problem.,3
2014-07-01,oba,Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done.,6
2014-07-01,oba,"Because if we pass a bill, that will supplant whatever I’ve done administratively.",3
2014-07-01,oba,"We’ll have a structure there that works, and it will be permanent.",3
2014-07-01,oba,And people can make plans and businesses can make plans based on the law.,6
2014-07-01,oba,And there will be clarity both here inside this country and outside it.,5
2014-07-01,oba,Let me just close by saying Friday is the Fourth of July.,7
2014-07-01,oba,It’s the day we celebrate our independence and all the things that make this country so great.,8
2014-07-01,oba,"And each year, Michelle and I host a few hundred servicemembers and wounded warriors and their families right here on the lawn for a barbecue and fireworks on the Mall.",5
2014-07-01,oba,"And some of the servicemembers coming this year are unique because they signed up to serve, to sacrifice, potentially to give their lives for the security of this country even though they weren’t yet Americans.",8
2014-07-01,oba,That's how much they love this country.,3
2014-07-01,oba,They were prepared to fight and die for an America they did not yet fully belong to.,6
2014-07-01,oba,I think they’ve earned their stripes in more ways than one.,5
2014-07-01,oba,And that’s why on Friday morning we’re going to naturalize them in a ceremony right here at the White House.,8
2014-07-01,oba,This Independence Day will be their first day as American citizens.,4
2014-07-01,oba,One of the things we celebrate on Friday –- one of the things that make this country great –- is that we are a nation of immigrants.,8
2014-07-01,oba,Our people come from every corner of the globe.,5
2014-07-01,oba,That's what makes us special.,3
2014-07-01,oba,That's what makes us unique.,3
2014-07-01,oba,"And throughout our history, we’ve come here in wave after wave from everywhere understanding that there was something about this place where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts; that all the different cultures and ideas and energy would come together and create something new.",16
2014-07-01,oba,We won this country’s freedom together.,3
2014-07-01,oba,We built this country together.,2
2014-07-01,oba,We defended this country together.,2
2014-07-01,oba,It makes us special.,2
2014-07-01,oba,It makes us strong.,2
2014-07-01,oba,It makes us Americans.,2
2014-07-01,oba,That’s worth celebrating.,2
2014-07-01,oba,And that's what I want not just House Republicans but all of us as Americans to remember.,5
2014-07-01,oba,Thanks very much.,2
2014-08-08,oba,Good evening.,1
2014-08-08,oba,"Today I authorized two operations in Iraq -- targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water and facing almost certain death.",12
2014-08-08,oba,Let me explain the actions we’re taking and why.,4
2014-08-08,oba,"First, I said in June -- as the terrorist group ISIL began an advance across Iraq -- that the United States would be prepared to take targeted military action in Iraq if and when we determined that the situation required it.",6
2014-08-08,oba,"In recent days, these terrorists have continued to move across Iraq, and have neared the city of Erbil, where American diplomats and civilians serve at our consulate and American military personnel advise Iraqi forces.",9
2014-08-08,oba,"To stop the advance on Erbil, I’ve directed our military to take targeted strikes against ISIL terrorist convoys should they move toward the city.",5
2014-08-08,oba,"We intend to stay vigilant, and take action if these terrorist forces threaten our personnel or facilities anywhere in Iraq, including our consulate in Erbil and our embassy in Baghdad.",9
2014-08-08,oba,We’re also providing urgent assistance to Iraqi government and Kurdish forces so they can more effectively wage the fight against ISIL.,4
2014-08-08,oba,"Second, at the request of the Iraqi government -- we’ve begun operations to help save Iraqi civilians stranded on the mountain1.",7
2014-08-08,oba,"As ISIL has marched across Iraq, it has waged a ruthless campaign against innocent Iraqis.",4
2014-08-08,oba,"And these terrorists have been especially barbaric towards religious minorities, including Christian and Yezidis, a small and ancient religious sect.",8
2014-08-08,oba,Countless Iraqis have been displaced.,2
2014-08-08,oba,"And chilling reports describe ISIL militants rounding up families, conducting mass executions, and enslaving Yezidi women.",4
2014-08-08,oba,"In recent days, Yezidi women, men and children from the area of Sinjar have fled for their lives.",6
2014-08-08,oba,"And thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands -- are now hiding high up on the mountain, with little but the clothes on their backs.",5
2014-08-08,oba,"They’re without food, they’re without water.",3
2014-08-08,oba,People are starving.,1
2014-08-08,oba,And children are dying of thirst.,2
2014-08-08,oba,"Meanwhile, ISIL forces below have called for the systematic destruction of the entire Yezidi people, which would constitute genocide.",6
2014-08-08,oba,"So these innocent families are faced with a horrible choice:  descend the mountain and be slaughtered, or stay and slowly die of thirst and hunger.",9
2014-08-08,oba,"I’ve said before, the United States cannot and should not intervene every time there’s a crisis in the world.",8
2014-08-08,oba,"So let me be clear about why we must act, and act now.",5
2014-08-08,oba,"When we face a situation like we do on that mountain -- with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale, when we have a mandate to help -- in this case, a request from the Iraqi government -- and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye.",10
2014-08-08,oba,"We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a potential act of genocide.",4
2014-08-08,oba,That’s what we’re doing on that mountain.,4
2014-08-08,oba,"I’ve, therefore, authorized targeted airstrikes, if necessary, to help forces in Iraq as they fight to break the siege of Mount Sinjar and protect the civilians trapped there.",7
2014-08-08,oba,"Already, American aircraft have begun conducting humanitarian airdrops of food and water to help these desperate men, women and children survive.",6
2014-08-08,oba,"Earlier this week, one Iraqi in the area cried to the world, ""There is no one coming to help.""",5
2014-08-08,oba,"Well today, America is coming to help.",2
2014-08-08,oba,We’re also consulting with other countries -- and the United Nations -- who have called for action to address this humanitarian crisis.,7
2014-08-08,oba,"I know that many of you are rightly concerned about any American military action in Iraq, even limited strikes like these.",6
2014-08-08,oba,I understand that.,1
2014-08-08,oba,"I ran for this office in part to end our war in Iraq and welcome our troops home, and that’s what we’ve done.",4
2014-08-08,oba,"As Commander-in-Chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq.",6
2014-08-08,oba,"And so even as we support Iraqis as they take the fight to these terrorists, American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq, because there’s no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq.",6
2014-08-08,oba,The only lasting solution is reconciliation among Iraqi communities and stronger Iraqi security forces.,5
2014-08-08,oba,"However, we can and should support moderate forces who can bring stability to Iraq.",4
2014-08-08,oba,"So even as we carry out these two missions, we will continue to pursue a broader strategy that empowers Iraqis to confront this crisis.",6
2014-08-08,oba,"Iraqi leaders need to come together and forge a new government that represents the legitimate interests of all Iraqis, and that can fight back against the threats like ISIL.",8
2014-08-08,oba,"Iraqis have named a new President, a new Speaker of Parliament, and are seeking consensus on a new Prime Minister.",5
2014-08-08,oba,This is the progress that needs to continue in order to reverse the momentum of the terrorists who prey on Iraq’s divisions.,14
2014-08-08,oba,"Once Iraq has a new government, the United States will work with it and other countries in the region to provide increased support to deal with this humanitarian crisis and counterterrorism challenge.",7
2014-08-08,oba,None of Iraq’s neighbors have an interest in this terrible suffering or instability.,5
2014-08-08,oba,"And so we’ll continue to work with our friends and allies to help refugees get the shelter and food and water they so desperately need, and to help Iraqis push back against ISIL.",7
2014-08-08,oba,"The several hundred American advisors that I ordered to Iraq will continue to assess what more we can do to help train, advise and support Iraqi forces going forward.",7
2014-08-08,oba,"And just as I consulted Congress on the decisions I made today, we will continue to do so going forward.",5
2014-08-08,oba,"My fellow Americans, the world is confronted by many challenges.",3
2014-08-08,oba,"And while America has never been able to right every wrong, America has made the world a more secure and prosperous place.",5
2014-08-08,oba,And our leadership is necessary to underwrite the global security and prosperity that our children and our grandchildren will depend upon.,7
2014-08-08,oba,We do so by adhering to a set of core principles.,7
2014-08-08,oba,We do whatever is necessary to protect our people.,4
2014-08-08,oba,We support our allies when they’re in danger.,3
2014-08-08,oba,We lead coalitions of countries to uphold international norms.,3
2014-08-08,oba,And we strive to stay true to the fundamental values -- the desire to live with basic freedom and dignity -- that is common to human beings wherever they are.,6
2014-08-08,oba,That’s why people all over the world look to the United States of America to lead.,5
2014-08-08,oba,And that’s why we do it.,2
2014-08-08,oba,So let me close by assuring you that there is no decision that I take more seriously than the use of military force.,12
2014-08-08,oba,"Over the last several years, we have brought the vast majority of our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan.",4
2014-08-08,oba,"And I’ve been careful to resist calls to turn time and again to our military, because America has other tools in our arsenal than our military.",7
2014-08-08,oba,"We can also lead with the power of our diplomacy, our economy, and our ideals.",7
2014-08-08,oba,"But when the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action.",5
2014-08-08,oba,That’s my responsibility as Commander-in-Chief.,5
2014-08-08,oba,"And when many thousands of innocent civilians are faced with the danger of being wiped out, and we have the capacity to do something about it, we will take action.",7
2014-08-08,oba,That is our responsibility as Americans.,3
2014-08-08,oba,That’s a hallmark of American leadership.,4
2014-08-08,oba,That’s who we are.,2
2014-08-08,oba,"So tonight, we give thanks to our men and women in uniform  -— especially our brave pilots and crews over Iraq who are protecting our fellow Americans and saving the lives of so many men, women and children that they will never meet.",9
2014-08-08,oba,They represent American leadership at its best.,3
2014-08-08,oba,"As a nation, we should be proud of them, and of our country’s enduring commitment to uphold our own security and the dignity of our fellow human beings.",8
2014-08-08,oba,"God bless our Armed Forces, and God bless the United States of America.",4
2014-08-12,oba,"Good afternoon, everybody.",2
2014-08-12,oba,This sound system is really powerful.,2
2014-08-12,oba,"Today, I’d like to update the American people on two issues that I’ve been monitoring closely these last several days.",6
2014-08-12,oba,"First of all, we continue to make progress in carrying out our targeted military operations in Iraq.",6
2014-08-12,oba,"Last week, I authorized two limited missions:  protecting our people and facilities inside of Iraq, and a humanitarian operation to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians stranded on a mountain.1

A week ago, we assessed that many thousands of Yezidi men, women and children had abandoned their possessions to take refuge on Mount Sinjar in a desperate attempt to avoid slaughter.",2
2014-08-12,oba,"We also knew that ISIL terrorists were killing and enslaving Yezidi civilians in their custody, and laying siege to the mountain.",5
2014-08-12,oba,"Without food or water, they faced a terrible choice -- starve on the mountain, or be slaughtered on the ground.",6
2014-08-12,oba,That’s when America came to help.,3
2014-08-12,oba,"Over the last week, the U.S. military conducted humanitarian air drops every night -- delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water.",7
2014-08-12,oba,"We were joined in that effort by the United Kingdom, and other allies pledged support.",3
2014-08-12,oba,"Our military was able to successfully strike ISIL targets around the mountain, which improved conditions for civilians to evacuate the mountain safely.",10
2014-08-12,oba,"Yesterday, a small team of Americans -- military and civilian -- completed their review of the conditions on the mountain.",6
2014-08-12,oba,"They found that food and water have been reaching those in need, and that thousands of people have been evacuating safely each and every night.",5
2014-08-12,oba,"The civilians who remain continue to leave, aided by Kurdish forces and Yezidis who are helping to facilitate the safe passage of their families.",11
2014-08-12,oba,"So the bottom line is, is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved and Americans should be very proud of our efforts.",7
2014-08-12,oba,Because of the skill and professionalism of our military -- and the generosity of our people -- we broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar; we helped vulnerable people reach safety; and we helped save many innocent lives.,6
2014-08-12,oba,"Because of these efforts, we do not expect there to be an additional operation to evacuate people off the mountain, and it’s unlikely that we’re going to need to continue humanitarian air drops on the mountain.",8
2014-08-12,oba,The majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving Iraq in the coming days.,6
2014-08-12,oba,"And I just want to say that as Commander-in-Chief, I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly.",8
2014-08-12,oba,I’m very grateful to them and I know that those who were trapped on that mountain are extraordinarily grateful as well.,7
2014-08-12,oba,"Now, the situation remains dire for Iraqis subjected to ISIL’s terror throughout the country, and this includes minorities like Yezidis and Iraqi Christians; it also includes Sunnis, Shia and Kurds.",7
2014-08-12,oba,We’re going to be working with our international partners to provide humanitarian assistance to those who are suffering in northern Iraq wherever we have capabilities and we can carry out effective missions like the one we carried out on Mount Sinjar without committing combat troops on the ground.,11
2014-08-12,oba,We obviously feel a great urge to provide some humanitarian relief to the situation and I’ve been very encouraged by the interest of our international partners in helping on these kinds of efforts as well.,10
2014-08-12,oba,We will continue air strikes to protect our people and facilities in Iraq.,4
2014-08-12,oba,We have increased the delivery of military assistance to Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting ISIL on the front lines.,7
2014-08-12,oba,"And, perhaps most importantly, we are urging Iraqis to come together to turn the tide against ISIL -- above all, by seizing the enormous opportunity of forming a new, inclusive government under the leadership of Prime Minister-designate Abadi.",14
2014-08-12,oba,"I had a chance to speak to Prime Minister-designate Abadi a few days ago, and he spoke about the need for the kind of inclusive government -- a government that speaks to all the people of Iraq -- that is needed right now.",11
2014-08-12,oba,"He still has a challenging task in putting a government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction.",6
2014-08-12,oba,"Now, second, I want to address something that’s been in the news over the last couple of days and that’s the situation in Ferguson, Missouri.",7
2014-08-12,oba,"I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we’ve seen in the heartland of our country, as police have clashed with people protesting.",9
2014-08-12,oba,"Today, I’d like us all to take a step back and think about how we’re going to be moving forward.",5
2014-08-12,oba,"This morning, I received a thorough update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been following it and been in communication with his team.",12
2014-08-12,oba,"I’ve already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground.",7
2014-08-12,oba,The Department of Justice is also consulting with local authorities about ways that they can maintain public safety without restricting the right of peaceful protest and while avoiding unnecessary escalation.,9
2014-08-12,oba,"I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened, and to see that justice is done.",6
2014-08-12,oba,I also just spoke with Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri.,4
2014-08-12,oba,"I expressed my concern over the violent turn that events have taken on the ground, and underscored that now is the time for all of us to reflect on what’s happened, and to find a way to come together going forward.",9
2014-08-12,oba,He is going to be traveling to Ferguson.,3
2014-08-12,oba,"He is a good man and a fine governor, and I’m confident that, working together, he is going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way.",14
2014-08-12,oba,"Of course, it’s important to remember how this started.",3
2014-08-12,oba,"We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances.",4
2014-08-12,oba,He was 18 years old.,3
2014-08-12,oba,His family will never hold Michael in their arms again.,3
2014-08-12,oba,"And when something like this happens, the local authorities -- including the police -- have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death, and how they are protecting the people in their communities.",8
2014-08-12,oba,"There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.",8
2014-08-12,oba,"There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.",8
2014-08-12,oba,"And here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground.",10
2014-08-12,oba,"Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority.",8
2014-08-12,oba,I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened.,6
2014-08-12,oba,There are going to be different accounts of how this tragedy occurred.,6
2014-08-12,oba,There are going to be differences in terms of what needs to happen going forward.,9
2014-08-12,oba,That’s part of our democracy.,4
2014-08-12,oba,But let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family.,6
2014-08-12,oba,"We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law; a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest; a reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us; and the need for accountability when it comes to our government.",9
2014-08-12,oba,So now is the time for healing.,3
2014-08-12,oba,Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson.,7
2014-08-12,oba,Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done.,6
2014-08-12,oba,And I’ve asked that the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney on the scene continue to work with local officials to move that process forward.,6
2014-08-12,oba,They will be reporting to me in the coming days about what’s being done to make sure that happens.,8
2014-08-12,oba,"Thanks very much, everybody.",2
2014-09-17,oba,"Good afternoon, everybody.",2
2014-09-17,oba,Please be seated.,1
2014-09-17,oba,I want to thank Dr. Frieden and everybody here at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for welcoming me here today.,8
2014-09-17,oba,"Tom and his team just gave me an update on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, our efforts to help mobilize the international community to fight it, and the steps that we’re taking to keep people here at home safe.",6
2014-09-17,oba,Tom and his team are doing outstanding work.,3
2014-09-17,oba,"Between the specialists they have on the ground in West Africa and here at headquarters, they’ve got hundreds of professionals who are working tirelessly on this issue.",8
2014-09-17,oba,This is the largest international response in the history of the CDC.,6
2014-09-17,oba,"After this, I’ll be meeting with some of these men and women, including some who recently returned from the front lines of the outbreak.",10
2014-09-17,oba,And they represent public service at its very best.,3
2014-09-17,oba,And so I just want them to know how much the American people appreciate them.,4
2014-09-17,oba,"Many of them are serving far away from home, away from their families.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"They are doing heroic work and serving in some unbelievably challenging conditions -- working through exhaustion, day and night, and many have volunteered to go back.",5
2014-09-17,oba,"So we are very, very proud of them.",3
2014-09-17,oba,Their work and our efforts across the government is an example of what happens when America leads in confronting some major global challenges.,8
2014-09-17,oba,"Faced with this outbreak, the world is looking to us, the United States, and it’s a responsibility that we embrace.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"We’re prepared to take leadership on this to provide the kinds of capabilities that only America has, and to mobilize the world in ways that only America can do.",9
2014-09-17,oba,That’s what we’re doing as we speak.,3
2014-09-17,oba,"First and foremost, I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.",10
2014-09-17,oba,"We’ve been taking the necessary precautions, including working with countries in West Africa to increase screening at airports so that someone with the virus doesn’t get on a plane for the United States.",10
2014-09-17,oba,"In the unlikely event that someone with Ebola does reach our shores, we’ve taken new measures so that we’re prepared here at home.",6
2014-09-17,oba,"We’re working to help flight crews identify people who are sick, and more labs across our country now have the capacity to quickly test for the virus.",6
2014-09-17,oba,"We’re working with hospitals to make sure that they are prepared, and to ensure that our doctors, our nurses and our medical staff are trained, are ready, and are able to deal with a possible case safely.",7
2014-09-17,oba,And here I’ve got to commend everybody at Emory University Hospital.,5
2014-09-17,oba,"I just had the opportunity to meet with Doctors Gartland and Ribner and members of their team and the nurses who -- sorry, doctors, but having been in hospitals, I know -- they’re the ones really doing the work.",8
2014-09-17,oba,And I had a chance to thank them for their extraordinary efforts in helping to provide care for the first Americans who recently contracted the disease in Africa.,13
2014-09-17,oba,The first two of those patients were released last month and continue to improve.,4
2014-09-17,oba,"And it’s a reminder for the American people that, should any cases appear in the United States, we have world-class facilities and professionals ready to respond.",8
2014-09-17,oba,And we have effective surveillance mechanisms in place.,2
2014-09-17,oba,"I should mention, by the way, that I had a chance to see Dr. Brantly in the Oval Office this morning.",6
2014-09-17,oba,"And although he is still having to gain back some weight, he looks great.",4
2014-09-17,oba,He looks strong and we are incredibly grateful to him and his family for the service that he has rendered to people who are a lot less lucky than all of us.,13
2014-09-17,oba,"As we all know, however, West Africa is facing a very different situation, especially in the hardest hit countries:  Liberia, Sierra Leone, and in Guinea.",5
2014-09-17,oba,"Tom and others recently returned from the region, and the scenes that they describe are just horrific.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"More than 2,400 men, women and children are known to have died -- and we strongly suspect that the actual death toll is higher than that.",5
2014-09-17,oba,"Hospitals, clinics and the few treatment centers that do exist have been completely overwhelmed.",5
2014-09-17,oba,An already very weak public health system is near collapse in these countries.,5
2014-09-17,oba,"Patients are being turned away, and people are literally dying in the streets.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"Now, here’s the hard truth:  In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not seen before.",7
2014-09-17,oba,It’s spiraling out of control.,3
2014-09-17,oba,It is getting worse.,1
2014-09-17,oba,It’s spreading faster and exponentially.,2
2014-09-17,oba,"Today, thousands of people in West Africa are infected.",6
2014-09-17,oba,That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands.,3
2014-09-17,oba,"And if the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected, with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us.",9
2014-09-17,oba,"So this is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security -- it’s a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic.",7
2014-09-17,oba,"That has profound effects on all of us, even if we are not directly contracting the disease.",5
2014-09-17,oba,"And that’s why, two months ago, I directed my team to make this a national security priority.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"We’re working this across our entire government, which is why today I’m joined by leaders throughout my administration, including from my national security team.",9
2014-09-17,oba,And we’ve devoted significant resources in support of our strategy with four goals in mind.,5
2014-09-17,oba,"Number one, to control the outbreak.",3
2014-09-17,oba,"Number two, to address the ripple effects of local economies and communities to prevent a truly massive humanitarian disaster.",5
2014-09-17,oba,"Number three, to coordinate a broader global response.",3
2014-09-17,oba,"And number four, to urgently build up a public health system in these countries for the future -- not just in West Africa but in countries that don’t have a lot of resources generally.",7
2014-09-17,oba,"Now, this is a daunting task.",2
2014-09-17,oba,But here’s what gives us hope.,2
2014-09-17,oba,The world knows how to fight this disease.,3
2014-09-17,oba,It’s not a mystery.,2
2014-09-17,oba,We know the science.,2
2014-09-17,oba,We know how to prevent it from spreading.,3
2014-09-17,oba,We know how to care for those who contract it.,5
2014-09-17,oba,"We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives.",4
2014-09-17,oba,But we have to act fast.,2
2014-09-17,oba,We can’t dawdle on this one.,3
2014-09-17,oba,"We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we had not seen before.",6
2014-09-17,oba,"So today, I’m announcing a major increase in our response.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"At the request of the Liberian government, we’re going to establish a military command center in Liberia to support civilian efforts across the region -- similar to our response after the Haiti earthquake.",6
2014-09-17,oba,"It’s going to be commanded by Major General Darryl Williams, commander of our Army forces in Africa.",8
2014-09-17,oba,He just arrived today and is now on the ground in Liberia.,5
2014-09-17,oba,"And our forces are going to bring their expertise in command and control, in logistics, in engineering.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"And our Department of Defense is better at that, our Armed Services are better at that than any organization on Earth.",5
2014-09-17,oba,We’re going to create an air bridge to get health workers and medical supplies into West Africa faster.,6
2014-09-17,oba,We’re going to establish a staging area in Senegal to help distribute personnel and aid on the ground more quickly.,7
2014-09-17,oba,We are going to create a new training site to train thousands of health workers so they can effectively and safely care for more patients.,6
2014-09-17,oba,Personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service will deploy to the new field hospitals that we’re setting up in Liberia.,5
2014-09-17,oba,And USAID will join with international partners and local communities in a Community Care Campaign to distribute supplies and information kits to hundreds of thousands of families so they can better protect themselves.,5
2014-09-17,oba,"We’re also going to build additional treatment units, including new isolation spaces and more than 1,000 beds.",7
2014-09-17,oba,"And in all our efforts, the safety of our personnel will remain a top priority.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"Meanwhile, our scientists continue their urgent research in the hope of finding new treatments and perhaps vaccines.",8
2014-09-17,oba,And today I’m calling on Congress to approve the funding that we’ve requested so that we can carry on with all these critical efforts.,7
2014-09-17,oba,"Today, the United States is doing even more.",2
2014-09-17,oba,"But this is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response.",4
2014-09-17,oba,International organizations just have to move faster than they have up until this point.,4
2014-09-17,oba,"More nations need to contribute experienced personnel, supplies, and funding that’s needed, and they need to deliver on what they pledge quickly.",6
2014-09-17,oba,"Charities and individual philanthropists have given generously, and they can make a big difference.",3
2014-09-17,oba,And so we’re not restricting these efforts to governmental organizations; we also need NGOs and private philanthropies to work with us in a coordinated fashion in order to maximize the impact of our response.,8
2014-09-17,oba,"This week, the United States will chair an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"Next week, I’ll join U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to continue mobilizing the international community around this effort.",5
2014-09-17,oba,"And then, at the White House, we’re going to bring more nations together to strengthen our global health security so that we can better prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics.",8
2014-09-17,oba,This is actually something that we had announced several months ago at the G7 meeting.,5
2014-09-17,oba,We determined that this has to be a top priority; this was before the Ebola outbreak.,5
2014-09-17,oba,"We anticipated the fact that in many of these countries with a weak public health system, if we don’t have more effective surveillance, more effective facilities on the ground, and are not helping poor countries in developing their ability to catch these things quickly, that there was at least the potential of seeing these kinds of outbreaks.",10
2014-09-17,oba,"And sadly, we now see that our predictions were correct.",3
2014-09-17,oba,It gives more urgency to this effort -- a global health initiative -- that we have been pushing internationally.,5
2014-09-17,oba,Let me just close by saying this:  The scenes that we’re witnessing in West Africa today are absolutely gut-wrenching.,10
2014-09-17,oba,"In one account over the weekend, we read about a family in Liberia.",5
2014-09-17,oba,The disease had already killed the father.,2
2014-09-17,oba,The mother was cradling a sick and listless five-year-old son.,5
2014-09-17,oba,"Her other son, 10-years-old, was dying, too.",4
2014-09-17,oba,They finally reached a treatment center but they couldn’t get in.,2
2014-09-17,oba,"And, said a relative, “We are just sitting.” 

These men and women and children are just sitting, waiting to die, right now.",2
2014-09-17,oba,And it doesn’t have to be this way.,3
2014-09-17,oba,The reality is that this epidemic is going to get worse before it gets better.,4
2014-09-17,oba,"But right now, the world still has an opportunity to save countless lives.",4
2014-09-17,oba,"Right now, the world has the responsibility to act -- to step up, and to do more.",4
2014-09-17,oba,The United States of America intends to do more.,3
2014-09-17,oba,We are going to keep leading in this effort.,5
2014-09-17,oba,"We’re going to do our part, and we’re going to continue to make sure that the world understands the need for them to step alongside us as well in order for us to not just save the lives of families like the one I just discussed, but ultimately, to make sure that this doesn’t have the kinds of spillover effects that become even more difficult to control.",14
2014-09-17,oba,So thank you very much to the entire team that’s already doing this work.,5
2014-09-17,oba,And please know that you’ve got your President and Commander-in-Chief behind you.,5
2014-09-17,oba,Thank you.,1
2014-10-18,oba,"Good job, everybody.",1
2014-10-18,oba,"Everybody, please have a seat.",2
2014-10-18,oba,"Well, it is good to be back at CFPB.",4
2014-10-18,oba,"Yes, this is an enthusiastic and rowdy crowd, this group.",3
2014-10-18,oba,That’s what happens when you do good things -- you feel good.,5
2014-10-18,oba,And this group is doing great work.,2
2014-10-18,oba,"I want to thank your director, Rich Cordray, for hosting me here today, and I want to thank all of you for doing a great job in looking out for the financial security of all Americans.",11
2014-10-18,oba,"Now, obviously, right now the news is dominated by Ebola, and we’ve got an all-hands-on-deck approach across government to make sure that we are keeping the American people safe.",6
2014-10-18,oba,"But even as we meet that particular challenge, it’s also important that we don’t lose sight of the other challenges that we face as a nation, especially the challenge of making sure that our economy works for every single American.",9
2014-10-18,oba,And that includes the challenge that brings me here today:  protecting Americans from financial fraud and identity theft.,6
2014-10-18,oba,"As President, I believe that America is stronger when our middle class can count on things like affordable health insurance, and Medicare and Social Security, where there are rules to protect our kids from dirty air or dirty water; rules to protect consumers from being taken advantage of.",10
2014-10-18,oba,"And I know you agree, those of you at CFPB, because that’s your mission.",4
2014-10-18,oba,"And that’s why part of the financial reform that we passed in the wake of the worse financial crisis since the Great Depression was the creation of this agency, to make sure that we are looking at every aspect of the financial system and ensuring that the American people have the basic protections that they should be able to count on.",13
2014-10-18,oba,You have one mission:  You’re a watchdog for consumers to make sure that the American people have somebody who’s got their backs.,7
2014-10-18,oba,"And because of the good work of many of the people who are here today, Americans have saved millions because they’ve been protected from predatory mortgage practices.",8
2014-10-18,oba,You’ve protected folks from deceptive credit card practices.,5
2014-10-18,oba,You’ve set up “Know Before You Owe” to help college be a little more affordable for young people and to make sure that they know the kind of debt that they’re accruing.,7
2014-10-18,oba,You’ve simplified mortgage forms so homeowners don’t get tricked in the final print.,4
2014-10-18,oba,"But all this work, taken together, the reason it’s important is because it’s not an abstraction; it saves people money and time and heartache.",4
2014-10-18,oba,"And before you, Americans who had gotten taken advantage of often had no way of achieving some sort of compensation.",6
2014-10-18,oba,"Today, you’ve actually secured billions of dollars in relief for victims.",5
2014-10-18,oba,You’ve helped to make people a little more whole after somebody engaged in fraudulent behavior.,5
2014-10-18,oba,Some folks in Congress fought tooth and nail to keep this agency from getting off the ground.,6
2014-10-18,oba,"There are some, frankly, who are still fighting to undo the rules we put in place to protect consumers.",6
2014-10-18,oba,"But I refuse to back down and go back to the days when mortgage lenders or financial firms could take advantage of consumers, and consumers had no recourse.",9
2014-10-18,oba,We’re moving forward.,1
2014-10-18,oba,America is better because of this agency and because of the rules that we’ve put in place.,6
2014-10-18,oba,"And the good news is, is that we’ve got more work to do.",4
2014-10-18,oba,"And today, we’re building on the progress that’s already been made by announcing new measures to protect America from identity theft and fraud.",9
2014-10-18,oba,"Now, we’ve all experienced the benefits of new technologies that let us buy and sell things faster and more efficiently than ever before.",11
2014-10-18,oba,But there are risks that come with these technologies as well.,5
2014-10-18,oba,"Last year, millions of Americans became victims of identity theft.",4
2014-10-18,oba,Millions were victims of this kind of fraud.,5
2014-10-18,oba,More than 100 million Americans had information that was compromised in data breaches in some of our largest companies.,7
2014-10-18,oba,And identity theft is now America’s fastest-growing crime.,3
2014-10-18,oba,"These crimes don’t just cost companies and consumers billions of dollars every year, they also threaten the economic security of middle-class Americans who have worked really hard for a lifetime to build some sort of security.",8
2014-10-18,oba,"The idea that somebody halfway around the world could run up thousands of dollars in charges in your name just because they stole your number, or because you swiped your card at the wrong place in the wrong time, that’s infuriating.",6
2014-10-18,oba,"For victims, it’s heartbreaking.",2
2014-10-18,oba,"And as a country, we’ve got to do more to stop it.",3
2014-10-18,oba,"And that’s why today we are launching an initiative called “Buy Secure” -- because you should be able to buy the things that you need without risking your identity, your credit score, or your savings.",10
2014-10-18,oba,"First, starting next year, we’re going to begin making sure that credit cards and credit-card readers issued by the United States government come equipped with two new layers of protection:  a microchip in the card that’s harder for thieves to clone than a magnetic strip, and a pin number you enter into the reader just as you do with an ATM.",11
2014-10-18,oba,We know this technology works.,3
2014-10-18,oba,"When Britain switched to a chip-and-pin system, they cut fraud in stores by 70 percent.",6
2014-10-18,oba,Seventy percent.,1
2014-10-18,oba,"Of course, no one security measure, no matter how powerful, can stop fraud on its own.",3
2014-10-18,oba,"So today, I’m also directing federal law enforcement to share more information with the private sector when they discover identity theft rings.",5
2014-10-18,oba,Folks here at the CFPB are working with banks to help make it easier for consumers to discover if fraudulent charges have been made to their account.,8
2014-10-18,oba,"The Federal Trade Commission will add new features to IdentityTheft.gov, and they’re going to work with credit bureaus to dramatically cut down on the time it takes for victims to recover their stolen identities.",9
2014-10-18,oba,And in the coming months I’ll be bringing together industry leaders and consumer advocates for a cybersecurity summit focused on protecting consumers using the next generation of mobile payment systems and devices.,11
2014-10-18,oba,And I’m happy to say that the private sector is already deeply engaged in this effort.,7
2014-10-18,oba,"Today, a group of retailers that include some of our largest -- Home Depot, Target, Walgreens, Walmart -- and representing more than 15,000 stores across the country, all of them are pledging to adopt chip-and-pin technology by the beginning of next year.",8
2014-10-18,oba,American Express is pledging $10 million to replace outdated card readers at small businesses.,4
2014-10-18,oba,MasterCard is pledging to provide its customers with free identity-theft monitoring and resolution support.,5
2014-10-18,oba,"And Citi is joining other financial institutions in making free FICO scores available to customers, because a sudden drop in your credit rating is one of the clearest signs that you’ve been hit by fraud.",7
2014-10-18,oba,So I want to thank all the business leaders who are choosing to protect their companies and their customers from the kind of hacking that we saw too many times this past year.,10
2014-10-18,oba,"I want to encourage every retailer, every bank, and every credit card company to join them in this effort.",8
2014-10-18,oba,"And even though I’m taking action today without Congress, Congress needs to do its part, as well.",3
2014-10-18,oba,"Today, data breaches are handled by dozens of separate state laws, and it’s time to have one clear national standard that brings certainty to businesses and keeps consumers safe.",7
2014-10-18,oba,Let me just close by saying this.,4
2014-10-18,oba,"Last week, I saw a survey that asked folks from all over the world what they thought of the idea that “success in life is pretty much determined by forces outside of our control.”  Of all the advanced economies on Earth, Americans, as you might expect, were the least likely to agree with that.",12
2014-10-18,oba,We think our fate is in our own hands.,4
2014-10-18,oba,"We think that if we work hard, that we can get ahead.",3
2014-10-18,oba,"For all the challenges of the 21st century, for all the tough, grueling work that's been required to rebuild this economy and people rebuilding their individual lives after a terrible recession, we still believe that our destiny is written by us -- not for us.",8
2014-10-18,oba,We believe that this is a country where hard work should pay off and responsibility should be rewarded.,5
2014-10-18,oba,That’s the principle all of you here at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau deeply believe in.,7
2014-10-18,oba,That's what you're fighting for every single day.,4
2014-10-18,oba,That's what I’m going to keep fighting for as long as I have the opportunity to be President.,9
2014-10-18,oba,And the executive order I’m signing and the great work that the companies are doing who are participating here today is going to just be one more brick in that bridge that we provide to hopefully all Americans so that they can translate their dreams into reality.,8
2014-10-18,oba,"So good job, everybody.",2
2014-10-18,oba,"Let me sign this.1

Rich, I should mention, by the way, that I went to a restaurant up in New York when I was there during the General Assembly, and my credit card was rejected.",6
2014-10-18,oba,It turned out I guess I don't use it enough.,3
2014-10-18,oba,So they thought there was some fraud going on.,4
2014-10-18,oba,"Fortunately, Michelle had hers.",1
2014-10-18,oba,"And I was trying to explain to the waitress, no, I really think that I’ve been paying my bills.",5
2014-10-18,oba,Even I’m affected by this.,2
2014-10-18,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2014-11-05,oba,"Good afternoon, everybody.",2
2014-11-05,oba,Have a seat.,2
2014-11-05,oba,"Today, I had a chance to speak with John Boehner and congratulated Mitch McConnell on becoming the next Senate Majority Leader.",5
2014-11-05,oba,"And I told them both that I look forward to finishing up this Congress’ business, and then working together for the next two years to advance America’s business.",6
2014-11-05,oba,And I very much appreciated Leader McConnell’s words last night about the prospect of working together to deliver for the American people.,8
2014-11-05,oba,"On Friday, I look forward to hosting the entire Republican and Democratic leadership at the White House to chart a new course forward.",5
2014-11-05,oba,"Obviously, Republicans had a good night, and they deserve credit for running good campaigns.",5
2014-11-05,oba,"Beyond that, I’ll leave it to all of you and the professional pundits to pick through yesterday’s results.",5
2014-11-05,oba,"What stands out to me, though, is that the American people sent a message, one that they’ve sent for several elections now.",7
2014-11-05,oba,They expect the people they elect to work as hard as they do.,6
2014-11-05,oba,They expect us to focus on their ambitions and not ours.,5
2014-11-05,oba,They want us to get the job done.,4
2014-11-05,oba,"All of us, in both parties, have a responsibility to address that sentiment.",4
2014-11-05,oba,"Still, as President, I have a unique responsibility to try and make this town work.",6
2014-11-05,oba,"So, to everyone who voted, I want you to know that I hear you.",4
2014-11-05,oba,"To the two-thirds of voters who chose not to participate in the process yesterday, I hear you, too.",9
2014-11-05,oba,"All of us have to give more Americans a reason to feel like the ground is stable beneath their feet, that the future is secure, that there’s a path for young people to succeed, and that folks here in Washington are concerned about them.",8
2014-11-05,oba,So I plan on spending every moment of the next two-plus years doing my job the best I can to keep this country safe and to make sure that more Americans share in its prosperity.,13
2014-11-05,oba,This country has made real progress since the crisis six years ago.,5
2014-11-05,oba,The fact is more Americans are working; unemployment has come down.,4
2014-11-05,oba,More Americans have health insurance.,2
2014-11-05,oba,Manufacturing has grown.,1
2014-11-05,oba,Our deficits have shrunk.,2
2014-11-05,oba,"Our dependence on foreign oil is down, as are gas prices.",4
2014-11-05,oba,Our graduation rates are up.,2
2014-11-05,oba,"Our businesses aren’t just creating jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s, our economy is outpacing most of the world.",4
2014-11-05,oba,"But we’ve just got to keep at it until every American feels the gains of a growing economy where it matters most, and that's in their own lives.",7
2014-11-05,oba,"Obviously, much of that will take action from Congress.",3
2014-11-05,oba,And I’m eager to work with the new Congress to make the next two years as productive as possible.,6
2014-11-05,oba,"I'm committed to making sure that I measure ideas not by whether they are from Democrats or Republicans, but whether they work for the American people.",8
2014-11-05,oba,And that’s not to say that we won’t disagree over some issues that we’re passionate about.,8
2014-11-05,oba,We will.,1
2014-11-05,oba,Congress will pass some bills I cannot sign.,3
2014-11-05,oba,I'm pretty sure I'll take some actions that some in Congress will not like.,7
2014-11-05,oba,That’s natural.,1
2014-11-05,oba,That's how our democracy works.,3
2014-11-05,oba,But we can surely find ways to work together on issues where there’s broad agreement among the American people.,9
2014-11-05,oba,So I look forward to Republicans putting forward their governing agenda.,4
2014-11-05,oba,I will offer my ideas on areas where I think we can move together to respond to people’s economic needs.,9
2014-11-05,oba,"So, just take one example.",2
2014-11-05,oba,We all agree on the need to create more jobs that pay well.,6
2014-11-05,oba,"Traditionally, both parties have been for creating jobs rebuilding our infrastructure -- our roads, bridges, ports, waterways.",9
2014-11-05,oba,I think we can hone in on a way to pay for it through tax reform that closes loopholes and makes it more attractive for companies to create jobs here in the United States.,14
2014-11-05,oba,We can also work together to grow our exports and open new markets for our manufacturers to sell more American-made goods to the rest of the world.,8
2014-11-05,oba,That's something I’ll be focused on when I travel to Asia next week.,5
2014-11-05,oba,We all share the same aspirations for our young people.,4
2014-11-05,oba,And I was encouraged that this year Republicans agreed to investments that expanded early childhood education.,6
2014-11-05,oba,I think we've got a chance to do more on that front.,6
2014-11-05,oba,We’ve got some common ideas to help more young people afford college and graduate without crippling debt so that they have the freedom to fill the good jobs of tomorrow and buy their first homes and start a family.,9
2014-11-05,oba,"And in the five states where a minimum wage increase was on the ballot last night, voters went five for five to increase it.",6
2014-11-05,oba,"That will give about 325,000 Americans a raise in states where Republican candidates prevailed.",6
2014-11-05,oba,"So that should give us new reason to get it done for everybody, with a national increase in the minimum wage.",5
2014-11-05,oba,So those are some areas where I think we've got some real opportunities to cooperate.,6
2014-11-05,oba,And I am very eager to hear Republican ideas for what they think we can do together over the next couple of years.,10
2014-11-05,oba,"Of course, there’s still business on the docket that needs attention this year.",6
2014-11-05,oba,"And here are three places where I think we can work together over the next several weeks, before this Congress wraps up for the holidays.",7
2014-11-05,oba,"First, I’m submitting a request to Congress for funding to ensure that our doctors, scientists, and troops have the resources that they need to combat the spread of Ebola in Africa and to increase our preparedness for any future cases here at home.",12
2014-11-05,oba,"Second, I'm going to begin engaging Congress over a new Authorization to Use Military Force against ISIL.",7
2014-11-05,oba,"The world needs to know we are united behind this effort, and the men and women of our military deserve our clear and unified support.",5
2014-11-05,oba,"Third, back in September, Congress passed short-term legislation to keep the government open and operating into December.",6
2014-11-05,oba,That gives Congress five weeks to pass a budget for the rest of the fiscal year.,7
2014-11-05,oba,"And I hope that they’ll do it in the same bipartisan, drama-free way that they did earlier this year.",6
2014-11-05,oba,When our companies are steadily creating jobs -- which they are -- we don’t want to inject any new uncertainty into the world economy and to the American economy.,6
2014-11-05,oba,The point is it’s time for us to take care of business.,5
2014-11-05,oba,There are things this country has to do that can’t wait another two years or another four years.,5
2014-11-05,oba,There are plans this country has to put in place for our future.,6
2014-11-05,oba,And the truth is I’m optimistic about our future.,5
2014-11-05,oba,I have good reason to be.,3
2014-11-05,oba,"I meet Americans all across the country who are determined, and big-hearted, and ask what they can do, and never give up, and overcome obstacles.",5
2014-11-05,oba,And they inspire me every single day.,2
2014-11-05,oba,So the fact is I still believe in what I said when I was first elected six years ago last night.,7
2014-11-05,oba,"For all the maps plastered across our TV screens today, and for all the cynics who say otherwise, I continue to believe we are simply more than just a collection of red and blue states.",9
2014-11-05,oba,We are the United States.,2
2014-11-05,oba,"And whether it's immigration or climate change, or making sure our kids are going to the best possible schools, to making sure that our communities are creating jobs; whether it's stopping the spread of terror and disease, to opening up doors of opportunity to everybody who’s willing to work hard and take responsibility -- the United States has big things to do.",13
2014-11-05,oba,We can and we will make progress if we do it together.,2
2014-11-05,oba,And I look forward to the work ahead.,3
2014-11-05,oba,"So, with that, let me take some questions.",3
2014-11-05,oba,I think that our team has got my list.,3
2014-11-05,oba,And we're going to start with Julie Pace at Associated Press.,6
2014-12-18,oba,Good afternoon.,1
2014-12-18,oba,"Today, the United States of America is changing its relationship with the people of Cuba.",5
2014-12-18,oba,"In the most significant changes in our policy in more than fifty years, we will end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"Through these changes, we intend to create more opportunities for the American and Cuban people, and begin a new chapter among the nations of the Americas.",7
2014-12-18,oba,There’s a complicated history between the United States and Cuba.,4
2014-12-18,oba,"I was born in 1961 -- just over two years after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, and just a few months after the Bay of Pigs invasion, which tried to overthrow his regime.",7
2014-12-18,oba,"Over the next several decades, the relationship between our countries played out against the backdrop of the Cold War, and America’s steadfast opposition to communism.",5
2014-12-18,oba,We are separated by just over 90 miles.,4
2014-12-18,oba,"But year after year, an ideological and economic barrier hardened between our two countries.",4
2014-12-18,oba,"Meanwhile, the Cuban exile community in the United States made enormous contributions to our country -- in politics and business, culture and sports.",5
2014-12-18,oba,"Like immigrants before, Cubans helped remake America, even as they felt a painful yearning for the land and families they left behind.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"All of this bound America and Cuba in a unique relationship, at once family and foe.",3
2014-12-18,oba,"Proudly, the United States has supported democracy and human rights in Cuba through these five decades.",3
2014-12-18,oba,"We have done so primarily through policies that aimed to isolate the island, preventing the most basic travel and commerce that Americans can enjoy anyplace else.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"And though this policy has been rooted in the best of intentions, no other nation joins us in imposing these sanctions, and it has had little effect beyond providing the Cuban government with a rationale for restrictions on its people.",10
2014-12-18,oba,"Today, Cuba is still governed by the Castros and the Communist Party that came to power half a century ago.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"Neither the American, nor Cuban people are well served by a rigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born.",11
2014-12-18,oba,"Consider that for more than 35 years, we’ve had relations with China -- a far larger country also governed by a Communist Party.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"Nearly two decades ago, we reestablished relations with Vietnam, where we fought a war that claimed more Americans than any Cold War confrontation.",11
2014-12-18,oba,That’s why -- when I came into office -- I promised to re-examine our Cuba policy.,4
2014-12-18,oba,"As a start, we lifted restrictions for Cuban Americans to travel and send remittances to their families in Cuba.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"These changes, once controversial, now seem obvious.",3
2014-12-18,oba,"Cuban Americans have been reunited with their families, and are the best possible ambassadors for our values.",5
2014-12-18,oba,"And through these exchanges, a younger generation of Cuban Americans has increasingly questioned an approach that does more to keep Cuba closed off from an interconnected world.",5
2014-12-18,oba,"While I have been prepared to take additional steps for some time, a major obstacle stood in our way -- the wrongful imprisonment, in Cuba, of a U.S. citizen and USAID sub-contractor Alan Gross for five years.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"Over many months, my administration has held discussions with the Cuban government about Alan’s case, and other aspects of our relationship.",5
2014-12-18,oba,"His Holiness Pope Francis issued a personal appeal to me, and to Cuba’s President Raul Castro, urging us to resolve Alan’s case, and to address Cuba’s interest in the release of three Cuban agents who have been jailed in the United States for over 15 years.",13
2014-12-18,oba,"Today, Alan returned home -- reunited with his family at long last.",4
2014-12-18,oba,Alan was released by the Cuban government on humanitarian grounds.,3
2014-12-18,oba,"Separately, in exchange for the three Cuban agents, Cuba today released one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba, and who has been imprisoned for nearly two decades.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"This man, whose sacrifice has been known to only a few, provided America with the information that allowed us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today, as well as other spies in the United States.",13
2014-12-18,oba,This man is now safely on our shores.,3
2014-12-18,oba,"Having recovered these two men who sacrificed for our country, I’m now taking steps to place the interests of the people of both countries at the heart of our policy.",7
2014-12-18,oba,"First, I’ve instructed Secretary Kerry to immediately begin discussions with Cuba to reestablish diplomatic relations that have been severed since January of 1961.",8
2014-12-18,oba,"Going forward, the United States will reestablish an embassy in Havana, and high-ranking officials will visit Cuba.",4
2014-12-18,oba,"Where we can advance shared interests, we will -- on issues like health, migration, counterterrorism, drug trafficking and disaster response.",8
2014-12-18,oba,"Indeed, we’ve seen the benefits of cooperation between our countries before.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"It was a Cuban, Carlos Finlay, who discovered that mosquitoes carry yellow fever; his work helped Walter Reed fight it.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"Cuba has sent hundreds of health care workers to Africa to fight Ebola, and I believe American and Cuban health care workers should work side by side to stop the spread of this deadly disease.",7
2014-12-18,oba,"Now, where we disagree, we will raise those differences directly -- as we will continue to do on issues related to democracy and human rights in Cuba.",9
2014-12-18,oba,But I believe that we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement.,5
2014-12-18,oba,"After all, these 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked.",2
2014-12-18,oba,It’s time for a new approach.,3
2014-12-18,oba,"Second, I’ve instructed Secretary Kerry to review Cuba’s designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.",6
2014-12-18,oba,This review will be guided by the facts and the law.,4
2014-12-18,oba,Terrorism has changed in the last several decades.,3
2014-12-18,oba,"At a time when we are focused on threats from al Qaeda to ISIL, a nation that meets our conditions and renounces the use of terrorism should not face this sanction.",13
2014-12-18,oba,"Third, we are taking steps to increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to and from Cuba.",7
2014-12-18,oba,"This is fundamentally about freedom and openness, and also expresses my belief in the power of people-to-people engagement.",9
2014-12-18,oba,"With the changes I’m announcing today, it will be easier for Americans to travel to Cuba, and Americans will be able to use American credit and debit cards on the island.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"Nobody represents America’s values better than the American people, and I believe this contact will ultimately do more to empower the Cuban people.",5
2014-12-18,oba,I also believe that more resources should be able to reach the Cuban people.,5
2014-12-18,oba,"So we’re significantly increasing the amount of money that can be sent to Cuba, and removing limits on remittances that support humanitarian projects, the Cuban people, and the emerging Cuban private sector.",7
2014-12-18,oba,"I believe that American businesses should not be put at a disadvantage, and that increased commerce is good for Americans and for Cubans.",6
2014-12-18,oba,So we will facilitate authorized transactions between the United States and Cuba.,4
2014-12-18,oba,U.S. financial institutions will be allowed to open accounts at Cuban financial institutions.,4
2014-12-18,oba,And it will be easier for U.S. exporters to sell goods in Cuba.,3
2014-12-18,oba,I believe in the free flow of information.,4
2014-12-18,oba,"Unfortunately, our sanctions on Cuba have denied Cubans access to technology that has empowered individuals around the globe.",5
2014-12-18,oba,So I’ve authorized increased telecommunications connections between the United States and Cuba.,4
2014-12-18,oba,Businesses will be able to sell goods that enable Cubans to communicate with the United States and other countries.,9
2014-12-18,oba,These are the steps that I can take as President to change this policy.,5
2014-12-18,oba,The embargo that’s been imposed for decades is now codified in legislation.,4
2014-12-18,oba,"As these changes unfold, I look forward to engaging Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo.",8
2014-12-18,oba,"Yesterday, I spoke with Raul Castro to finalize Alan Gross’s release and the exchange of prisoners, and to describe how we will move forward.",5
2014-12-18,oba,I made clear my strong belief that Cuban society is constrained by restrictions on its citizens.,8
2014-12-18,oba,"In addition to the return of Alan Gross and the release of our intelligence agent, we welcome Cuba’s decision to release a substantial number of prisoners whose cases were directly raised with the Cuban government by my team.",9
2014-12-18,oba,"We welcome Cuba’s decision to provide more access to the Internet for its citizens, and to continue increasing engagement with international institutions like the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross that promote universal values.",12
2014-12-18,oba,But I’m under no illusion about the continued barriers to freedom that remain for ordinary Cubans.,10
2014-12-18,oba,"The United States believes that no Cubans should face harassment or arrest or beatings simply because they’re exercising a universal right to have their voices heard, and we will continue to support civil society there.",7
2014-12-18,oba,"While Cuba has made reforms to gradually open up its economy, we continue to believe that Cuban workers should be free to form unions, just as their citizens should be free to participate in the political process.",8
2014-12-18,oba,"Moreover, given Cuba’s history, I expect it will continue to pursue foreign policies that will at times be sharply at odds with American interests.",9
2014-12-18,oba,I do not expect the changes I am announcing today to bring about a transformation of Cuban society overnight.,7
2014-12-18,oba,"But I am convinced that through a policy of engagement, we can more effectively stand up for our values and help the Cuban people help themselves as they move into the 21st century.",8
2014-12-18,oba,"To those who oppose the steps I’m announcing today, let me say that I respect your passion and share your commitment to liberty and democracy.",7
2014-12-18,oba,The question is how we uphold that commitment.,3
2014-12-18,oba,I do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result.,6
2014-12-18,oba,"Moreover, it does not serve America’s interests, or the Cuban people, to try to push Cuba toward collapse.",4
2014-12-18,oba,Even if that worked -- and it hasn’t for 50 years -- we know from hard-earned experience that countries are more likely to enjoy lasting transformation if their people are not subjected to chaos.,9
2014-12-18,oba,"We are calling on Cuba to unleash the potential of 11 million Cubans by ending unnecessary restrictions on their political, social, and economic activities.",9
2014-12-18,oba,"In that spirit, we should not allow U.S. sanctions to add to the burden of Cuban citizens that we seek to help.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"To the Cuban people, America extends a hand of friendship.",3
2014-12-18,oba,"Some of you have looked to us as a source of hope, and we will continue to shine a light of freedom.",5
2014-12-18,oba,Others have seen us as a former colonizer intent on controlling your future.,6
2014-12-18,oba,"José Martí once said, “Liberty is the right of every man to be honest.”  Today, I am being honest with you.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"We can never erase the history between us, but we believe that you should be empowered to live with dignity and self-determination.",7
2014-12-18,oba,Cubans have a saying about daily life:  “No es facil” -- it’s not easy.,5
2014-12-18,oba,"Today, the United States wants to be a partner in making the lives of ordinary Cubans a little bit easier, more free, more prosperous.",8
2014-12-18,oba,"To those who have supported these measures, I thank you for being partners in our efforts.",6
2014-12-18,oba,"In particular, I want to thank His Holiness Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is; the government of Canada, which hosted our discussions with the Cuban government; and a bipartisan group of congressmen who have worked tirelessly for Alan Gross’s release, and for a new approach to advancing our interests and values in Cuba.",11
2014-12-18,oba,"Finally, our shift in policy towards Cuba comes at a moment of renewed leadership in the Americas.",7
2014-12-18,oba,"This April, we are prepared to have Cuba join the other nations of the hemisphere at the Summit of the Americas.",11
2014-12-18,oba,"But we will insist that civil society join us so that citizens, not just leaders, are shaping our future.",5
2014-12-18,oba,And I call on all of my fellow leaders to give meaning to the commitment to democracy and human rights at the heart of the Inter-American Charter.,8
2014-12-18,oba,"Let us leave behind the legacy of both colonization and communism, the tyranny of drug cartels, dictators and sham elections.",7
2014-12-18,oba,"A future of greater peace, security and democratic development is possible if we work together -- not to maintain power, not to secure vested interest, but instead to advance the dreams of our citizens.",5
2014-12-18,oba,"My fellow Americans, the city of Miami is only 200 miles or so from Havana.",3
2014-12-18,oba,Countless thousands of Cubans have come to Miami -- on planes and makeshift rafts; some with little but the shirt on their back and hope in their hearts.,7
2014-12-18,oba,"Today, Miami is often referred to as the capital of Latin America.",5
2014-12-18,oba,"But it is also a profoundly American city -- a place that reminds us that ideals matter more than the color of our skin, or the circumstances of our birth; a demonstration of what the Cuban people can achieve, and the openness of the United States to our family to the South.",10
2014-12-18,oba,Todos somos Americanos.,1
2014-12-18,oba,"Change is hard -- in our own lives, and in the lives of nations.",4
2014-12-18,oba,And change is even harder when we carry the heavy weight of history on our shoulders.,4
2014-12-18,oba,But today we are making these changes because it is the right thing to do.,4
2014-12-18,oba,"Today, America chooses to cut loose the shackles of the past so as to reach for a better future -- for the Cuban people, for the American people, for our entire hemisphere, and for the world.",6
2014-12-18,oba,Thank you.,1
2014-12-18,oba,God bless you and God bless the United States of America.,4
2015-01-08,oba,I strongly condemn the horrific shooting at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris that has reportedly killed 12 people.,7
2015-01-08,oba,Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this terrorist attack and the people of France at this difficult time.,7
2015-01-08,oba,France is America's oldest ally and has stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the fight against terrorists who threaten our shared security and the world.,11
2015-01-08,oba,"Time and again, the French people have stood up for the universal values that generations of our people have defended.",7
2015-01-08,oba,France and the great city of Paris where this outrageous attack took place offer the world a timeless example that will endure well beyond the hateful vision of these killers.,7
2015-01-08,oba,"We are in touch with French officials, and I have directed my administration to provide any assistance needed to help bring these terrorists to justice.",8
2015-01-21,oba,"

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:

2015-01-21,oba,It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come.,6
2015-01-21,oba,Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?,4

2015-01-21,oba,"“If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.” 

As the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.",4
2015-01-21,oba,They sacrificed for each other.,3
2015-01-21,oba,"And slowly, it paid off.",1
2015-01-21,oba,They bought their first home.,2
2015-01-21,oba,"They had a second son, Henry.",2
2015-01-21,oba,Rebekah got a better job and then a raise.,2
2015-01-21,oba,Ben is back in construction -- and home for dinner every night.,3
2015-01-21,oba,"“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to...we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”  We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story.",5

2015-01-21,oba,"And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.",7
2015-01-21,oba,We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores.,5

2015-01-21,oba,"At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.",5

2015-01-21,oba,"This is good news, people.",2
2015-01-21,oba,So the verdict is clear.,2
2015-01-21,oba,Middle-class economics works.,3
2015-01-21,oba,Expanding opportunity works.,2
2015-01-21,oba,And these policies will continue to work as long as politics don’t get in the way.,6
2015-01-21,oba,We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.,7

2015-01-21,oba,Wages are finally starting to rise again.,2
2015-01-21,oba,We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007.,7
2015-01-21,oba,"But here’s the thing:  Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t screw things up; that government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making.",8
2015-01-21,oba,We need to do more than just do no harm.,3
2015-01-21,oba,"Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American.",7
2015-01-21,oba,Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help.,4

2015-01-21,oba,"Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.",5
2015-01-21,oba,"Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.",4
2015-01-21,oba,"We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet -- tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them.",8
2015-01-21,oba,"That’s what middle-class economics is -- the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success, we want everyone to contribute to our success.",6
2015-01-21,oba,So what does middle-class economics require in our time?,3
2015-01-21,oba,"First, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.",8
2015-01-21,oba,"That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement.",8
2015-01-21,oba,"And my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.",6
2015-01-21,oba,Here’s one example.,2
2015-01-21,oba,"During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority -- so this country provided universal childcare.",10
2015-01-21,oba,"In today’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.",5
2015-01-21,oba,It’s not a nice-to-have -- it’s a must-have.,4
2015-01-21,oba,"So it’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or as a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.",10
2015-01-21,oba,"And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America -- by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.",9
2015-01-21,oba,Here’s another example.,2
2015-01-21,oba,"Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.",7
2015-01-21,oba,Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave -- 43 million.,3
2015-01-21,oba,Think about that.,2
2015-01-21,oba,And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.,6
2015-01-21,oba,So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.,6
2015-01-21,oba,"And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington.",7
2015-01-21,oba,Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.,8
2015-01-21,oba,It’s the right thing to do.,3
2015-01-21,oba,It’s the right thing to do.,3
2015-01-21,oba,"Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.",5
2015-01-21,oba,That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.,13
2015-01-21,oba,It’s 2015.,1
2015-01-21,oba,It’s time.,1
2015-01-21,oba,We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned.,6
2015-01-21,oba,"And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it.",8
2015-01-21,oba,"If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.",6
2015-01-21,oba,"Now, these ideas won’t make everybody rich, won’t relieve every hardship.",3
2015-01-21,oba,That’s not the job of government.,3
2015-01-21,oba,"To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice.",4
2015-01-21,oba,"But you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage -- these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.",7
2015-01-21,oba,That’s a fact.,2
2015-01-21,oba,"And that’s what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do.",4
2015-01-21,oba,"Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world.",5
2015-01-21,oba,We were ahead of the curve.,4
2015-01-21,oba,But other countries caught on.,2
2015-01-21,oba,"And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game.",6
2015-01-21,oba,We need to do more.,2
2015-01-21,oba,"By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education -- two in three.",5
2015-01-21,oba,"And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"It’s not fair to them, and it’s sure not smart for our future.",5
2015-01-21,oba,That’s why I’m sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college -- to zero.,7
2015-01-21,oba,Keep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college.,5
2015-01-21,oba,Some are young and starting out.,3
2015-01-21,oba,Some are older and looking for a better job.,5
2015-01-21,oba,Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.,6
2015-01-21,oba,"Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt.",6
2015-01-21,oba,"Understand, you’ve got to earn it.",2
2015-01-21,oba,You’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.,4
2015-01-21,oba,"Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.",6
2015-01-21,oba,Let’s stay ahead of the curve.,5
2015-01-21,oba,And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.,9
2015-01-21,oba,"Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships -- opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education.",10
2015-01-21,oba,"And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.",4
2015-01-21,oba,"Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.",7
2015-01-21,oba,We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need.,8
2015-01-21,oba,And we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.,5
2015-01-21,oba,"And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden -- thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:  If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran.",7
2015-01-21,oba,"Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.",5
2015-01-21,oba,"Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.",8
2015-01-21,oba,"Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.",3
2015-01-21,oba,"Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.",4
2015-01-21,oba,"But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist 10 or 20 years ago -- jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.",9
2015-01-21,oba,So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.,5
2015-01-21,oba,But we do know we want them here in America.,4
2015-01-21,oba,We know that.,1
2015-01-21,oba,"And that’s why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.",6

2015-01-21,oba,Let’s do it.,2
2015-01-21,oba,Let’s get it done.,3
2015-01-21,oba,Let’s get it done.,3
2015-01-21,oba,"Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.",4
2015-01-21,oba,"Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.",4
2015-01-21,oba,"But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region.",6
2015-01-21,oba,That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.,3
2015-01-21,oba,Why would we let that happen?,2
2015-01-21,oba,We should write those rules.,2
2015-01-21,oba,We should level the playing field.,2
2015-01-21,oba,"That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but are also fair.",8
2015-01-21,oba,It’s the right thing to do.,3
2015-01-21,oba,"Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.",8
2015-01-21,oba,But 95 percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders.,5
2015-01-21,oba,We can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities.,3
2015-01-21,oba,More than half of manufacturing executives have said they’re actively looking to bring jobs back from China.,5

2015-02-14,oba,"It was from here, in 1968, where a researcher, Douglas Englebart, astonished an audience with two computers, connected “online,” and hypertext you could click on with something called a “mouse.” 

A year later, a computer here received the first message from another computer 350 miles away -- the beginnings of what would become the Internet.",8
2015-02-14,oba,"And, by the way, it’s no secret that many of these innovations built on government-funded research is one of the reasons that if we want to maintain our economic leadership in the world, America has to keep investing in basic research in science and technology.",13
2015-02-14,oba,It's absolutely critical.,2
2015-02-14,oba,"So here at Stanford, pioneers developed the protocols and architecture of the Internet, DSL, the first webpage in America, innovations for cloud computing.",6
2015-02-14,oba,Student projects here became Yahoo and Google.,2
2015-02-14,oba,Those were pretty good student projects.,3
2015-02-14,oba,"Your graduates have gone on to help create and build thousands of companies that have shaped our digital society -- from Cisco to Sun Microsystems, YouTube to Instagram, StubHub, Bonobos.",11
2015-02-14,oba,"According to one study, if all the companies traced back to Stanford graduates formed their own nation, you’d be one the largest economies in the world and have a pretty good football team as well.",6
2015-02-14,oba,"And today, with your cutting-edge research programs and your new cyber initiatives, you’re helping us navigate some of the most complicated cyber challenges that we face as a nation.",8
2015-02-14,oba,And that’s why we’re here.,2
2015-02-14,oba,"I want to thank all of you who have joined us today -- members of Congress, representatives from the private sector, government, academia, privacy and consumer groups, and especially the students who are here.",11
2015-02-14,oba,"Just as we’re all connected like never before, we have to work together like never before, both to seize opportunities but also meet the challenges of this Information Age.",7
2015-02-14,oba,And it’s one of the great paradoxes of our time that the very technologies that empower us to do great good can also be used to undermine us and inflict great harm.,6
2015-02-14,oba,The same information technologies that help make our military the most advanced in the world are targeted by hackers from China and Russia who go after our defense contractors and systems that are built for our troops.,12
2015-02-14,oba,The same social media we use in government to advocate for democracy and human rights around the world can also be used by terrorists to spread hateful ideologies.,8
2015-02-14,oba,So these cyber threats are a challenge to our national security.,4
2015-02-14,oba,"Much of our critical infrastructure -- our financial systems, our power grid, health systems -- run on networks connected to the Internet, which is hugely empowering but also dangerous, and creates new points of vulnerability that we didn’t have before.",9
2015-02-14,oba,Foreign governments and criminals are probing these systems every single day.,2
2015-02-14,oba,"We only have to think of real-life examples -- an air traffic control system going down and disrupting flights, or blackouts that plunge cities into darkness -- to imagine what a set of systematic cyber attacks might do.",8
2015-02-14,oba,So this is also a matter of public safety.,4
2015-02-14,oba,"As a nation, we do more business online than ever before -- trillions of dollars a year.",6
2015-02-14,oba,"And high-tech industries, like those across the Valley, support millions of American jobs.",6
2015-02-14,oba,All this gives us an enormous competitive advantage in the global economy.,4
2015-02-14,oba,"And for that very reason, American companies are being targeted, their trade secrets stolen, intellectual property ripped off.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"The North Korean cyber attack on Sony Pictures destroyed data and disabled thousands of computers, and exposed the personal information of Sony employees.",5
2015-02-14,oba,And these attacks are hurting American companies and costing American jobs.,3
2015-02-14,oba,So this is also a threat to America’s economic security.,5
2015-02-14,oba,"As consumers, we do more online than ever before.",4
2015-02-14,oba,We manage our bank accounts.,2
2015-02-14,oba,We shop.,1
2015-02-14,oba,We pay our bills.,2
2015-02-14,oba,We handle our medical records.,2
2015-02-14,oba,"And as a country, one of our greatest resources are the young people who are here today --digitally fearless and unencumbered by convention, and uninterested in old debates.",6
2015-02-14,oba,And they’re remaking the world every day.,2
2015-02-14,oba,But it also means that this problem of how we secure this digital world is only going to increase.,5
2015-02-14,oba,I want more Americans succeeding in our digital world.,4
2015-02-14,oba,"I want young people like you to unleash the next waves of innovation, and launch the next startups, and give Americans the tools to create new jobs and new businesses, and to expand connectivity in places that we currently can't imagine, to help open up new world and new experiences and empower individuals in ways that would seem unimaginable 10, 15, 20 years ago.",16
2015-02-14,oba,"And that’s why we’re working to connect 99 percent of America’s students to high-speed Internet -- because when it comes to educating our children, we can’t afford any digital divides.",7
2015-02-14,oba,"It’s why we’re helping more communities get across to the next generation of broadband faster, with cheaper Internet, so that students and entrepreneurs and small businesses across America, not just in pockets of America, have the same opportunities to learn and compete as you do here in the Valley.",9
2015-02-14,oba,"It’s why I’ve come out so strongly and publicly for net neutrality, for an open and free Internet -- because we have to preserve one of the greatest engines for creativity and innovation in human history.",10
2015-02-14,oba,"So our connectivity brings extraordinary benefits to our daily lives, but it also brings risks.",3
2015-02-14,oba,"And when companies get hacked, Americans’ personal information, including their financial information, gets stolen.",4
2015-02-14,oba,Identity theft can ruin your credit rating and turn your life upside down.,3
2015-02-14,oba,"In recent breaches, more than 100 million Americans had their personal data compromised, including, in some cases, credit card information.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"We want our children to go online and explore the world, but we also want them to be safe and not have their privacy violated.",6
2015-02-14,oba,"So this is a direct threat to the economic security of American families, not just the economy overall, and to the wellbeing of our children, which means we’ve got to put in place mechanisms to protect them.",9
2015-02-14,oba,"So shortly after I took office, before I had gray hair -- I said that these cyber threats were one of the most serious economic national security challenges that we face as a nation, and I made confronting them a priority.",8
2015-02-14,oba,"And given the complexity of these threats, I believe we have to be guided by some basic principles.",5
2015-02-14,oba,So let me share those with you today.,3
2015-02-14,oba,"First, this has to be a shared mission.",3
2015-02-14,oba,"So much of our computer networks and critical infrastructure are in the private sector, which means government cannot do this alone.",5
2015-02-14,oba,"But the fact is that the private sector can’t do it alone either, because it’s government that often has the latest information on new threats.",8
2015-02-14,oba,"There’s only one way to defend America from these cyber threats, and that is through government and industry working together, sharing appropriate information as true partners.",6
2015-02-14,oba,"Second, we have to focus on our unique strengths.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"Government has many capabilities, but it’s not appropriate or even possible for government to secure the computer networks of private businesses.",6
2015-02-14,oba,"Many of the companies who are here today are cutting-edge, but the private sector doesn’t always have the capabilities needed during a cyber attack, the situational awareness, or the ability to warn other companies in real time, or the capacity to coordinate a response across companies and sectors.",13
2015-02-14,oba,"So we’re going to have to be smart and efficient and focus on what each sector does best, and then do it together.",7
2015-02-14,oba,"Third, we’re going to have to constantly evolve.",3
2015-02-14,oba,"The first computer viruses hit personal computers in the early 1980s, and essentially, we’ve been in a cyber arms race ever since.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"We design new defenses, and then hackers and criminals design new ways to penetrate them.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"Whether it’s phishing or botnets, spyware or malware, and now ransomware, these attacks are getting more and more sophisticated every day.",4
2015-02-14,oba,So we’ve got to be just as fast and flexible and nimble in constantly evolving our defenses.,5
2015-02-14,oba,"And fourth, and most importantly, in all our work we have to make sure we are protecting the privacy and civil liberty of the American people.",8
2015-02-14,oba,And we grapple with these issues in government.,4
2015-02-14,oba,We’ve pursued important reforms to make sure we are respecting peoples’ privacy as well as ensuring our national security.,6
2015-02-14,oba,And the private sector wrestles with this as well.,2
2015-02-14,oba,"When consumers share their personal information with companies, they deserve to know that it’s going to be protected.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"When government and industry share information about cyber threats, we’ve got to do so in a way that safeguards your personal information.",6
2015-02-14,oba,"When people go online, we shouldn’t have to forfeit the basic privacy we’re entitled to as Americans.",5
2015-02-14,oba,"In recent years, we’ve worked to put these principles into practice.",3
2015-02-14,oba,"And as part of our comprehensive strategy, we’ve boosted our defenses in government, we’re sharing more information with the private sector to help those companies defend themselves, we’re working with industry to use what we call a Cybersecurity Framework to prevent, respond to, and recover from attacks when they happen.",7
2015-02-14,oba,"And, by the way, I recently went to the National Cybersecurity Communications Integration Center, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, where representatives from government and the private sector monitor cyber threats 24/7.",12
2015-02-14,oba,"And so defending against cyber threats, just like terrorism or other threats, is one more reason that we are calling on Congress, not to engage in politics -- this is not a Republican or Democratic issue -- but work to make sure that our security is safeguarded and that we fully fund the Department of Homeland Security, because it has great responsibilities in this area.",10
2015-02-14,oba,"So we’re making progress, and I’ve recently announced new actions to keep up this momentum.",5
2015-02-14,oba,We’ve called for a single national standard so Americans know within 30 days if your information has been stolen.,4
2015-02-14,oba,"This month, we’ll be proposing legislation that we call a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to give Americans some baseline protections, like the right to decide what personal data companies collect from you, and the right to know how companies are using that information.",10
2015-02-14,oba,"We’ve proposed the Student Digital Privacy Act, which is modeled on the landmark law here in California -- because today’s amazing educational technologies should be used to teach our students and not collect data for marketing to students.",8
2015-02-14,oba,"And we’ve also taken new steps to strengthen our cybersecurity -- proposing new legislation to promote greater information sharing between government and the private sector, including liability protections for companies that share information about cyber threats.",11
2015-02-14,oba,"Today, I’m once again calling on Congress to come together and get this done.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"And this week, we announced the creation of our new Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center.",5
2015-02-14,oba,"Just like we do with terrorist threats, we’re going to have a single entity that’s analyzing and integrating and quickly sharing intelligence about cyber threats across government so we can act on all those threats even faster.",8
2015-02-14,oba,"And today, we’re taking an additional step -- which is why there’s a desk here.",5
2015-02-14,oba,"You were wondering, I'm sure.",2
2015-02-14,oba,"I’m signing a new executive order to promote even more information sharing about cyber threats, both within the private sector and between government and the private sector.",8
2015-02-14,oba,And it will encourage more companies and industries to set up organizations -- hubs -- so you can share information with each other.,4
2015-02-14,oba,"It will call for a common set of standards, including protections for privacy and civil liberties, so that government can share threat information with these hubs more easily.",8
2015-02-14,oba,And it can help make it easier for companies to get the classified cybersecurity threat information that they need to protect their companies.,8
2015-02-14,oba,"I want to acknowledge, by the way, that the companies who are represented here are stepping up as well.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"The Cyber Threat Alliance, which includes companies like Palo Alto Networks and Symantec, are going to work with us to share more information under this new executive order.",7
2015-02-14,oba,"You’ve got companies from Apple to Intel, from Bank of America to PG&E, who are going to use the Cybersecurity Framework to strengthen their own defenses.",9
2015-02-14,oba,"As part of our BuySecure Initiative, Visa and MasterCard and American Express and others are going to make their transactions more secure.",5
2015-02-14,oba,"Nationstar is joining companies that are giving their companies another weapon to battle identity theft, and that's free access to their credit scores.",6
2015-02-14,oba,"And more companies are moving to new, stronger technologies to authenticate user identities, like biometrics -- because it’s just too easy for hackers to figure out usernames and passwords, like “password.”  Or “12345 -- 7.”   Those are some of my previous passwords.",5
2015-02-14,oba,I've changed them since then.,2
2015-02-14,oba,So this summit is an example of what we need more of -- all of us working together to do what none of us can achieve alone.,8
2015-02-14,oba,And it is difficult.,1
2015-02-14,oba,Some of the challenges I’ve described today have defied solutions for years.,6
2015-02-14,oba,"And I want to say very clearly that, as somebody who is a former constitutional law teacher, and somebody who deeply values his privacy and his family’s privacy -- although I chose the wrong job for that -- but will be a private citizen again, and cares deeply about this -- I have to tell you that grappling with how government protects the American people from adverse events while, at the same time, making sure that government itself is not abusing its capabilities is hard.",13
2015-02-14,oba,"The cyber world is sort of the wild, wild West.",3
2015-02-14,oba,"And to some degree, we're asked to be the sheriff.",3
2015-02-14,oba,"When something like Sony happens, people want to know what can government do about this.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"If information is being shared by terrorists in the cyber world and an attack happens, people want to know are there ways of stopping that from happening.",7
2015-02-14,oba,"By necessity, that means government has its own significant capabilities in the cyber world.",5
2015-02-14,oba,"But then people, rightly, ask, well, what safeguards do we have against government intruding on our own privacy?",6
2015-02-14,oba,"And it's hard, and it constantly evolves because the technology so often outstrips whatever rules and structures and standards have been put in place, which means that government has to be constantly self-critical and we have to be able to have an open debate about it.",10
2015-02-14,oba,But we’re all here today because we know that we're going to have to break through some of these barriers that are holding us back if we are going to continue to thrive in this remarkable new world.,15
2015-02-14,oba,We all know what we need to do.,3
2015-02-14,oba,We have to build stronger defenses and disrupt more attacks.,4
2015-02-14,oba,We have to make cyberspace safer.,3
2015-02-14,oba,We have to improve cooperation across the board.,5
2015-02-14,oba,"And, by the way, this is not just here in America, but internationally -- which also, by the way, makes things complicated because a lot of countries don't necessarily share our investment -- or our commitment to openness, and we have to try to navigate that.",6
2015-02-14,oba,But this should not be an ideological issue.,2
2015-02-14,oba,"And that’s one thing I want to emphasize:  This is not a Democratic issue, or a Republican issue.",5
2015-02-14,oba,This is not a liberal or conservative issue.,3
2015-02-14,oba,"Everybody is online, and everybody is vulnerable.",2
2015-02-14,oba,"The business leaders here want their privacy and their children protected, just like the consumer and privacy advocates here want America to keep leading the world in technology and be safe from attacks.",6
2015-02-14,oba,"So I’m hopeful that through this forum and the work that we do subsequently, that we're able to generate ideas and best practices, and that the work of this summit can help guide our planning and execution for years to come.",8
2015-02-14,oba,"After all, we are just getting started.",2
2015-02-14,oba,Think about it.,2
2015-02-14,oba,"Tim Berners-Lee, from his lab in Switzerland, invented the World Wide Web in 1989, which was only 26 years ago.",7
2015-02-14,oba,"The great epochs in human history -- the Bronze Age, Iron Age, Agricultural Revolution, Industrial Revolution -- they spanned centuries.",6
2015-02-14,oba,We’re only 26 years into this Internet Age.,4
2015-02-14,oba,We’ve only scratched the surface.,2
2015-02-14,oba,"And as I guess they say at Google, “The future is awesome.”  We haven’t even begun to imagine the discoveries and innovations that are going to be unleashed in the decades to come.",4
2015-02-14,oba,But we know how we’ll get there.,2
2015-02-14,oba,"Reflecting on his work in the 1960s on ARPANET, the precursor of the Internet, the late Paul Baran said this:  “The process of technological developments is like building a cathedral.",7
2015-02-14,oba,"Over the course of several hundred years, new people come along and each lays down a block on top of the old foundations, each saying, ‘I built the cathedral.’  And then comes along an historian who asks, ‘Well, who built the cathedral?’”  And Baran said, “If you’re not careful, you can con yourself into believing that you did the most important part.",7
2015-02-14,oba,But the reality is that each contribution has to follow on to previous work.,5
2015-02-14,oba,"Everything is tied to everything else.”

Everything is tied to everything else.",3
2015-02-14,oba,"The innovations that first appeared on this campus all those decades ago -- that first mouse, that first message -- helped lay a foundation.",4
2015-02-14,oba,"And in the decades since, on campuses like this, in companies like those that are represented here, new people have come along, each laying down a block, one on top of the other.",7
2015-02-14,oba,"And when future historians ask who built this Information Age, it won’t be any one of us who did the most important part alone.",5
2015-02-14,oba,"The answer will be, “We all did, as Americans.”

And I’m absolutely confident that if we keep at this, if we keep working together in a spirit of collaboration, like all those innovators before us, our work will endure, like a great cathedral, for centuries to come.",3
2015-02-14,oba,"And that cathedral will not just be about technology, it will be about the values that we’ve embedded in the architecture of this system.",8
2015-02-14,oba,"It will be about privacy, and it will be about community.",3
2015-02-14,oba,And it will be about connection.,2
2015-02-14,oba,What a magnificent cathedral that all of you have helped to build.,4
2015-02-14,oba,"We want to be a part of that, and we look forward to working with you in the future.",6
2015-02-14,oba,Thank you for your partnership.,3
2015-02-14,oba,"With that, I’m going to sign this executive order.",3
2015-02-14,oba,Thank you.,1
2015-03-11,oba,Let’s give it up for Buzz and the Georgia Tech Band for getting us fired up.,5
2015-03-11,oba,"Also give it up for Governor Nathan Deal, who is here.",4
2015-03-11,oba,Congressmen Hank Johnson and David Scott.,2
2015-03-11,oba,Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.,2
2015-03-11,oba,"And the President of this great institution, Georgia Tech, Bud Peterson.",3
2015-03-11,oba,That’s good.,1
2015-03-11,oba,You’ve got a high approval rating.,2
2015-03-11,oba,You do.,1
2015-03-11,oba,Absolutely.,1
2015-03-11,oba,"We also have a special guest with us -- this is a proud Georgia Tech alum, who just happens also to be the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Sandy Winnefeld is here.",8
2015-03-11,oba,Where’s Sandy?,1
2015-03-11,oba,There he is.,1
2015-03-11,oba,"Before he was the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he was a Navy fighter pilot, which is cooler.",6
2015-03-11,oba,Now he just goes to meetings.,2
2015-03-11,oba,What’s up with that?,2
2015-03-11,oba,I told him he’s got to get back on a plane.,6
2015-03-11,oba,It is great to be at one of the finest technical institutes in the world.,8
2015-03-11,oba,One of the finest in the world.,5
2015-03-11,oba,"I mean, you’ve got to be if the Ramblin’ Wreck is still running after all these years.",5
2015-03-11,oba,That’s a Georgia Tech reference that some of you may not know.,5
2015-03-11,oba,I also know that Georgia Tech is terrific because we’ve actually worked with you on several fronts -– from promoting advanced manufacturing to unlocking the mysteries of the brain to helping more students become entrepreneurs.,10
2015-03-11,oba,"And the reason I wanted to come here today is because I believe that higher education, as you believe, is one of the best investments that anybody can make in their future.",9
2015-03-11,oba,And it’s also one of the best investments you can make in our country’s future.,8
2015-03-11,oba,"So I’m here to say thank you and to tell you I’m proud of you, because I know that it’s not always easy to do what you’re doing.",7
2015-03-11,oba,It takes perseverance.,1
2015-03-11,oba,"A lot of late nights in the library and the lab, and you’re wrapping your minds around complex formulas and concepts that, frankly, I don’t understand.",6
2015-03-11,oba,But I know they’re complex.,2
2015-03-11,oba,"And some of you are holding jobs down at the same time, which makes it even harder.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"But as frustrating as it may be, and Tiffany expressed some frustrations on occasion, it is worth it.",5
2015-03-11,oba,Higher education has never been more important.,2
2015-03-11,oba,"And the message I want to deliver today, not just to you but to the entire country, is the entire nation has to treat it as a priority.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"Right now, our economy is growing steadily.",2
2015-03-11,oba,It's creating new jobs.,2
2015-03-11,oba,You’re going to be going into a job market that’s much better than the one that existed when I came into office six years ago.,12
2015-03-11,oba,"After the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, over the past five years, our businesses have now created 12 million new jobs.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"Unemployment continues to come down, and obviously that’s good news for those of you who are graduating soon.",6
2015-03-11,oba,"Yes, that’s right, you want a job.",2
2015-03-11,oba,Your parents also want you to have a job.,3
2015-03-11,oba,They don’t want you on the couch.,3
2015-03-11,oba,But I didn’t run for President just to get us back to where we were -– I ran for President to get us to where we need to go.,6
2015-03-11,oba,And where we need to go is a growing middle class with rising incomes and opportunities for everybody who’s willing to work hard.,9
2015-03-11,oba,"An America where no matter who you are, what you look like, where you came from, how you started, who you love, what faith you’re a part of, you can make it in this country if you try.",7
2015-03-11,oba,That’s what America is all about.,3
2015-03-11,oba,"And today, a college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class and beyond.",4
2015-03-11,oba,It’s the key to getting a good job that pays a good income.,7
2015-03-11,oba,"And it offers a measure of security, because a college degree tells employers that you don’t just have one set of skills; that you’ve got the continuous capacity to learn new skills, which is going to be particularly important for your generation because the economy is going to churn and change in ways that none of us can even anticipate.",9
2015-03-11,oba,"Before we came out here, I was talking to a group, including Sandy Winnefeld, and your Mayor Kasim Reed, Tyler Perry buddies -- he wasn’t in Madea, he was Tyler.",6
2015-03-11,oba,"And we were talking about how rapidly the technology is transforming everything we understand, everything we know --everything from drones, to artificial intelligence, to driver-less cars.",6
2015-03-11,oba,"And we don’t yet know how all that is going to shape the nation that you inherit, but we know it's going to shape it dramatically.",6
2015-03-11,oba,"And in order for you to be able to be successful, you’re going to have to adapt, continuously.",4
2015-03-11,oba,"The days where you work at one place for 30, 40 years, those days are over.",7
2015-03-11,oba,And so the skillsets you are getting now are going to keep you in that job market.,4
2015-03-11,oba,You’re going to have multiple jobs before you’re 30.,3
2015-03-11,oba,Some of you will have multiple careers.,3
2015-03-11,oba,"And we live in a 21st-century economy, where your most valuable asset is your imagination, your knowledge, your ability to analyze tough problems.",6
2015-03-11,oba,"And that’s not just true for individual Americans, it’s true for our whole country.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"The ability to compete in the global economy depends on us having the world’s most skilled, best-educated workforce.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"And by the way, let me just add, it’s also going to be critical for us to maintain our democracy in a complex, diverse society.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"Understandably, when I come to college campuses, there’s a lot of just bread and butter, nuts and bolts, how does this translate into jobs, careers.",6
2015-03-11,oba,"But part of what has made America the exceptional nation that it is, is our diversity and our ability to draw from every corner of the world -- all the talent, all the ideas -- and create this amazing stew.",8
2015-03-11,oba,"And the more complex this society, the tougher that becomes.",3
2015-03-11,oba,"And so to have all of you possess the ability to listen and to learn from people who aren’t like you -- that’s also what you’re learning here, and that’s going to make you more effective to every employer out there.",8
2015-03-11,oba,"But it’s also -- it’s going to make you better citizens, and it’s going to make our democracy function better.",5
2015-03-11,oba,But back to the jobs thing.,3
2015-03-11,oba,Jobs and businesses will go wherever the best workers are.,3
2015-03-11,oba,And I don’t want them to have to look any further than the United States of America.,7
2015-03-11,oba,I want businesses investing here.,2
2015-03-11,oba,I want Americans getting those new jobs.,3
2015-03-11,oba,That’s how we’re going to lead the world in this century just like we did in the 20th century.,6
2015-03-11,oba,"So here’s the challenge:  Higher education has never been more important, but it’s also never been more expensive.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"The average undergrad who borrows money to pay for college graduates with about $28,000 in student loan debt.",8
2015-03-11,oba,That’s just the average; some students end up with a lot more than that -- you know who you are.,4
2015-03-11,oba,I’m not telling you anything you don’t know.,3
2015-03-11,oba,And let me say that it’s been established time and time again that Georgia Tech is one of the best bargains around.,7
2015-03-11,oba,You are getting a great education for a great value.,3
2015-03-11,oba,"Which is one of the reasons I’m here; obviously, I wouldn’t go to a place that was a bad bargain and really expensive and no value.",6
2015-03-11,oba,That would not make sense.,1
2015-03-11,oba,"But even here at Georgia Tech, even with the great value it is, it’s expensive.",4
2015-03-11,oba,"And I’m here to tell you, I’m with you.",4
2015-03-11,oba,I believe that America is not a place where higher education is a privilege that is reserved for the few.,8
2015-03-11,oba,America needs to be a place where higher education has to be available for every single person who’s willing to strive for it -- who’s willing to work for it.,11
2015-03-11,oba,And I’ve said this before:  I take this personally.,2
2015-03-11,oba,"My grandfather had a chance to go to college because this country decided that when veterans returned home from World War II, they should be able to go to college.",6
2015-03-11,oba,And this government stepped up.,2
2015-03-11,oba,"My mother was able to raise two kids by herself, in part because she got grants that helped pay for her education.",6
2015-03-11,oba,And I am only standing here -– and Michelle is only where she is today –- because of scholarships and student loans and work study.,6
2015-03-11,oba,We did not come from families of means.,4
2015-03-11,oba,"We didn't come from families of means, but we knew that if we worked hard, there was help out there to make sure we got a great education.",7
2015-03-11,oba,That’s what this country gave to us.,3
2015-03-11,oba,And that’s why this has been such a priority for me.,4
2015-03-11,oba,"I take it personally because when I look out at all of you, I see myself.",6
2015-03-11,oba,And I remember the fact that it took me 10 years to pay off all our student loans.,5
2015-03-11,oba,"We were paying more for our student loans than our mortgage, even after Malia and Sasha were born.",5
2015-03-11,oba,We were supposed to be saving for their college education; we were still paying off ours.,5
2015-03-11,oba,And that's why we’ve acted again and again to make college more affordable.,4
2015-03-11,oba,"Five years ago this month, we enacted the largest reforms to the student loan program in history.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"We cut out the big banks that were taking taxpayer dollars and serving as middlemen in the student loan game, and we said, well, let’s just give the money directly to the students like you.",9
2015-03-11,oba,"So as a result of that change, we saved billions of dollars.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"We were to expand tax credits and Pell grants, and put college within reach for millions more middle-class and low-income students across the country.",7
2015-03-11,oba,Then we fought to keep interest rates on student rates -- interest rates on student loans low and capped how high those rates can rise.,7
2015-03-11,oba,"And as a result, the typical undergrad is saving about $1,500.",3
2015-03-11,oba,"We also acted to let millions of graduates cap their loan payments at 10 percent of their incomes, so they don’t have to choose between paying the rent and paying back their debt.",8
2015-03-11,oba,"And by the way, everybody here, if you don't already know about the Income-Based Repayment Program, you need to learn about it because it’s still under-utilized.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"But it gives you an opportunity to make sure that if you make a career choice that doesn't make tons of money, you're still able to do the responsible thing and pay back your loans at a pace that also allows you to build a family and buy a home and live your lives.",15
2015-03-11,oba,"And graduates who go into lower-paying fields like social work or teaching, they're not going to pay a price for following their dreams because they're going to have even better options in terms of how they repay their loans.",8
2015-03-11,oba,So that's what we did on the student loan side.,5
2015-03-11,oba,"Meanwhile, we’re working to hold down the cost of a college education.",5
2015-03-11,oba,So we’re partnering with schools like Georgia Tech on innovative ways to increase value -– like your online master’s program in computer science -- which costs just a fraction of the price of an in-classroom program.,11
2015-03-11,oba,And I sent Congress a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college to zero.,6
2015-03-11,oba,Because not everybody may be prepared right away to start a four-year university.,4
2015-03-11,oba,"But also, in some cases, even if they could, they may choose to get two years of college free, and then be able to transfer the credits for their four-year education.",7
2015-03-11,oba,"We want to make community college, at minimum, just as free and universal as high school is today.",5
2015-03-11,oba,That should be our new baseline.,2
2015-03-11,oba,We want to get out ahead of the curve in terms of where we need to go.,7
2015-03-11,oba,"Earlier today, I took a new action to make it easier for students to pay for college and pay off their loans.",6
2015-03-11,oba,"We’re creating a way for you to ask questions about your loans, file a complaint, cut through the bureaucracy, get a faster response.",7
2015-03-11,oba,"That’s not just from the government, that’s also from the contractors who sometimes service your loans.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"We’re going to require that the businesses that service your loans provide clear information about how much you owe, what your options are for repaying it, and if you’re falling behind, help you get back in good standing with reasonable fees on a reasonable timeline.",9
2015-03-11,oba,"And if you’re paying stuff off, you should be paying off the high-interest loans first, not the low-interest ones.",3
2015-03-11,oba,"We’re going to take a hard look at whether we need new laws to strengthen protections for all borrowers, wherever you get your loans from.",9
2015-03-11,oba,So we’re trying to tackle this problem from every angle.,4
2015-03-11,oba,There’s no silver bullet.,2
2015-03-11,oba,"But we’re trying to make sure that across the board, more and more young people can afford to go to college, and then afterwards, aren’t so burdened with debt that you can’t do anything else.",7
2015-03-11,oba,"We want to make this experience more affordable because you’re not just investing in yourselves, you’re investing in your nation.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"But here’s the thing:  We’ve got more to do, all of us -- universities, students, parents, financial institutions and, yes, the government, to make sure that you’re not saddled with debt before you even get started in life.",9
2015-03-11,oba,That’s something that’s in all of our interests.,7
2015-03-11,oba,"Now, my friends, the Republicans in Congress, are planning to unveil their budget soon.",4
2015-03-11,oba,I’m hoping they have something to offer that will help hardworking young people.,6
2015-03-11,oba,"So far, the education bill that they put forward a couple weeks ago is not a good template, it’s not a good start.",7
2015-03-11,oba,"I’m hoping it will improve because right now, the way it’s structured, it would let states and cities shuffle education dollars into things like sports stadiums or tax cuts for the wealthy instead of schools.",12
2015-03-11,oba,"And it would allow states to make even deeper cuts into school districts that need the most support, send even more money to the most well-off school districts.",7
2015-03-11,oba,We’d invest less per child by the end of the decade than we do now.,5
2015-03-11,oba,So it’s the wrong approach.,2
2015-03-11,oba,"We’ve got to be working to make sure every child gets a quality education, every student can afford college.",7
2015-03-11,oba,"And so we’re going to be reaching out to them, trying to get them to see this is a good investment in our economy, it’s a good investment in our national security.",9
2015-03-11,oba,"The way that you keep America safe, one of the best, most important ways is to make sure we’ve got a strong economy with a strong workforce.",6
2015-03-11,oba,And all of us have a role to play in making that happen.,6
2015-03-11,oba,"So in order to spur more of a conversation to get more folks engaged, we’re going to try something new to help do this.",10
2015-03-11,oba,It’s not a fancy new program.,2
2015-03-11,oba,It’s not -- it doesn’t have a complicated acronym.,2
2015-03-11,oba,It doesn’t involve new spending or bureaucracy.,2
2015-03-11,oba,"It’s just a simple organizing principle that I want all of us to sign onto, a declaration of values –- what I’m calling a Student Aid Bill of Rights.",5
2015-03-11,oba,"And it says every student deserves access to a quality, affordable education.",5
2015-03-11,oba,Every student should be able to access the resources to pay for college.,5
2015-03-11,oba,Every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan.,4
2015-03-11,oba,"Every borrower has the right to quality customer service, reliable information, and fair treatment, even if they struggle to repay their loans.",6
2015-03-11,oba,"It’s a simple set of principles that if everybody signed onto -- Republicans, Democrats, state legislators, university presidents, members of Congress -- it can focus our attention, all these different things that we’re doing, into one simple, basic idea, which is, make sure that when you’re doing the right thing, that your society has got your back and is looking out for you.",10
2015-03-11,oba,"So based on this principle, we’re going to make sure universities are using technology to help students learn at lower costs.",8
2015-03-11,oba,We’re going to make sure that loan servicers can find better ways to help borrowers keep up with monthly payments that they can afford.,10
2015-03-11,oba,We as a country can do more to invest in Pell grants and community college to make sure quality education is affordable for everybody.,8
2015-03-11,oba,So we’re going to just keep on moving on every front.,5
2015-03-11,oba,"And we want everybody who agrees with these principles to sit down and work with us, and figure out how they can make these student rights real.",7
2015-03-11,oba,And you’ve got a part to play as well.,4
2015-03-11,oba,We had the great honor of being at Selma this past weekend for the 50th anniversary of the March from Selma.,8
2015-03-11,oba,"And one of the main points I think that all of us made was change doesn’t happen by itself; it happens because people get organized and mobilized and focused, and they push, and sometimes they disrupt and they make folks uncomfortable, and they ask questions about why is it this way instead of that way.",9
2015-03-11,oba,And I want us to think about access to higher education and affordability of higher education in that same way.,8
2015-03-11,oba,"I want us to all organize together -- not on a partisan basis, it’s not organizing around an election, it’s organizing around a simple idea that everybody should be able to get behind.",7
2015-03-11,oba,And you’re going to have to play the part.,4
2015-03-11,oba,"Because what we also made the point of this past weekend is young people typically lead the pack with new ideas, with new initiatives, with new focus, with a new vision.",6
2015-03-11,oba,"So if you agree with the basic values that I outlined, if you believe in a Student Aid Bill of Rights that will help more Americans pay for a quality education, then sign your name to this declaration.",8
2015-03-11,oba,"You can go to a website, because you guys like tech stuff.",3
2015-03-11,oba,You go to: WhiteHouse.gov/CollegeOpportunity -- WhiteHouse.gov/CollegeOpportunity.,3
2015-03-11,oba,Tell your families and classmates and professors to do it.,3
2015-03-11,oba,"I’m going to ask members of Congress, and lenders, and as many business leaders as I can find to sign up.",4
2015-03-11,oba,"We’re going to mobilize a coalition around this country to get this process moving, because there are a lot of good ideas right now but they’re stalled, or they’re happening piecemeal, or they’re happening in one university, or they’re happening in one state, and they have to happen everywhere.",8
2015-03-11,oba,And we’ve got to mobilize the entire nation to make that happen.,4
2015-03-11,oba,"And it's going to start with students themselves, because if you aren’t asking for something different, if you aren’t asking for help, if you’re not getting mobilized, then folks aren’t going to help you, and then you’ll just be complaining -- especially once you graduate and you start having to write those checks.",7
2015-03-11,oba,"So don’t stop engaging in this issue, even after you graduate, because you’ll be still impacted by it.",4
2015-03-11,oba,"And in the meantime, you’ve got to study hard, and work hard, and have fun.",3
2015-03-11,oba,Make some new discoveries.,2
2015-03-11,oba,Inspire us.,1
2015-03-11,oba,Lead us.,1
2015-03-11,oba,Be the Americans that we need you to be.,3
2015-03-11,oba,Every American should have the right to go as far as their talents and hard work will take them.,7
2015-03-11,oba,That is what college is all about.,3
2015-03-11,oba,That is what America is all about.,3
2015-03-11,oba,And you embody that basic notion.,2
2015-03-11,oba,You are that talent.,2
2015-03-11,oba,"You are an embodiment of what we hope for:  A country that says that everybody, rich, poor, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, gay, straight, man, woman, with disabilities, without -- no matter who you are or where you come from, not only can you succeed but you can help everybody else succeed.",16
2015-03-11,oba,That’s the promise that helped us become the greatest nation in the world.,7
2015-03-11,oba,That’s the promise that I need you working for.,4
2015-03-11,oba,"Thank you, everybody.",1
2015-03-11,oba,God bless you.,1
2015-03-11,oba,"Thank you, Georgia.",2
2015-04-03,oba,"Good afternoon, everybody.",2
2015-04-03,oba,"Today, the United States -- together with our allies and partners -- has reached a historic understanding with Iran, which, if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.",8
2015-04-03,oba,"As President and Commander-in-Chief, I have no greater responsibility than the security of the American people.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"And I am convinced that if this framework leads to a final, comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies, and our world safer.",7
2015-04-03,oba,This has been a long time coming.,2
2015-04-03,oba,The Islamic Republic of Iran has been advancing its nuclear program for decades.,3
2015-04-03,oba,"By the time I took office, Iran was operating thousands of centrifuges, which can produce the materials for a nuclear bomb -- and Iran was concealing a covert nuclear facility.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"I made clear that we were prepared to resolve this issue diplomatically, but only if Iran came to the table in a serious way.",5
2015-04-03,oba,"When that did not happen, we rallied the world to impose the toughest sanctions in history -- sanctions which had a profound impact on the Iranian economy.",8
2015-04-03,oba,"Now, sanctions alone could not stop Iran’s nuclear program.",3
2015-04-03,oba,But they did help bring Iran to the negotiating table.,4
2015-04-03,oba,"Because of our diplomatic efforts, the world stood with us and we were joined at the negotiating table by the world’s major powers -- the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, as well as the European Union.",10
2015-04-03,oba,"Over a year ago, we took the first step towards today’s framework with a deal to stop the progress of Iran’s nuclear program and roll it back in key areas.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"And recall that at the time, skeptics argued that Iran would cheat, and that we could not verify their compliance and the interim agreement would fail.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"Instead, it has succeeded exactly as intended.",3
2015-04-03,oba,Iran has met all of its obligations.,4
2015-04-03,oba,It eliminated its stockpile of dangerous nuclear material.,4
2015-04-03,oba,Inspections of Iran’s program increased.,5
2015-04-03,oba,And we continued negotiations to see if we could achieve a more comprehensive deal.,6
2015-04-03,oba,"Today, after many months of tough, principled diplomacy, we have achieved the framework for that deal.",5
2015-04-03,oba,"And it is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives.",5
2015-04-03,oba,This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.,5
2015-04-03,oba,"Iran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history.",8
2015-04-03,oba,"So this deal is not based on trust, it’s based on unprecedented verification.",3
2015-04-03,oba,"Many key details will be finalized over the next three months, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed.",3
2015-04-03,oba,But here are the basic outlines of the deal that we are working to finalize.,6
2015-04-03,oba,"First, Iran will not be able to pursue a bomb using plutonium, because it will not develop weapons-grade plutonium.",5
2015-04-03,oba,The core of its reactor at Arak will be dismantled and replaced.,5
2015-04-03,oba,The spent fuel from that facility will be shipped out of Iran for the life of the reactor.,5
2015-04-03,oba,Iran will not build a new heavy-water reactor.,3
2015-04-03,oba,And Iran will not reprocess fuel from its existing reactors -- ever.,4
2015-04-03,oba,"Second, this deal shuts down Iran’s path to a bomb using enriched uranium.",5
2015-04-03,oba,Iran has agreed that its installed centrifuges will be reduced by two-thirds.,4
2015-04-03,oba,Iran will no longer enrich uranium at its Fordow facility.,3
2015-04-03,oba,Iran will not enrich uranium with its advanced centrifuges for at least the next 10 years.,6
2015-04-03,oba,The vast majority of Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium will be neutralized.,6
2015-04-03,oba,"Today, estimates indicate that Iran is only two or three months away from potentially acquiring the raw materials that could be used for a single nuclear bomb.",9
2015-04-03,oba,"Under this deal, Iran has agreed that it will not stockpile the materials needed to build a weapon.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"Even if it violated the deal, for the next decade at least, Iran would be a minimum of a year away from acquiring enough material for a bomb.",6
2015-04-03,oba,And the strict limitations on Iran’s stockpile will last for 15 years.,5
2015-04-03,oba,"Third, this deal provides the best possible defense against Iran’s ability to pursue a nuclear weapon covertly -- that is, in secret.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"International inspectors will have unprecedented access not only to Iranian nuclear facilities, but to the entire supply chain that supports Iran’s nuclear program -- from uranium mills that provide the raw materials, to the centrifuge production and storage facilities that support the program.",8
2015-04-03,oba,"If Iran cheats, the world will know it.",2
2015-04-03,oba,"If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it.",3
2015-04-03,oba,Iran’s past efforts to weaponize its program will be addressed.,4
2015-04-03,oba,"With this deal, Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world.",6
2015-04-03,oba,So this will be a long-term deal that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb.,5
2015-04-03,oba,There will be strict limits on Iran’s program for a decade.,5
2015-04-03,oba,Additional restrictions on building new facilities or stockpiling materials will last for 15 years.,6
2015-04-03,oba,The unprecedented transparency measures will last for 20 years or more.,4
2015-04-03,oba,"Indeed, some will be permanent.",1
2015-04-03,oba,"And as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran will never be permitted to develop a nuclear weapon.",5
2015-04-03,oba,"In return for Iran’s actions, the international community has agreed to provide Iran with relief from certain sanctions -- our own sanctions, and international sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council.",12
2015-04-03,oba,This relief will be phased as Iran takes steps to adhere to the deal.,6
2015-04-03,oba,"If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place.",3
2015-04-03,oba,"Meanwhile, other American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, will continue to be fully enforced.",5
2015-04-03,oba,"Now, let me reemphasize, our work is not yet done.",3
2015-04-03,oba,The deal has not been signed.,2
2015-04-03,oba,"Between now and the end of June, the negotiators will continue to work through the details of how this framework will be fully implemented, and those details matter.",7
2015-04-03,oba,"If there is backsliding on the part of the Iranians, if the verification and inspection mechanisms don’t meet the specifications of our nuclear and security experts, there will be no deal.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"But if we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully.",8
2015-04-03,oba,"Given the importance of this issue, I have instructed my negotiators to fully brief Congress and the American people on the substance of the deal, and I welcome a robust debate in the weeks and months to come.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"I am confident that we can show that this deal is good for the security of the United States, for our allies, and for the world.",9
2015-04-03,oba,"For the fact is, we only have three options for addressing Iran’s nuclear program.",7
2015-04-03,oba,"First, we can reach a robust and verifiable deal -- like this one -- and peacefully prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.",7
2015-04-03,oba,"The second option is we can bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, thereby starting another war in the Middle East, and setting back Iran’s program by a few years -- in other words, setting it back by a fraction of the time that this deal will set it back.",11
2015-04-03,oba,Meanwhile we’d ensure that Iran would race ahead to try and build a bomb.,5
2015-04-03,oba,"Third, we could pull out of negotiations, try to get other countries to go along and continue sanctions that are currently in place or add additional ones, and hope for the best -- knowing that every time we have done so, Iran has not capitulated but instead has advanced its program, and that in very short order, the breakout timeline would be eliminated and a nuclear arms race in the region could be triggered because of that uncertainty.",10
2015-04-03,oba,"In other words, the third option leads us very quickly back to a decision about whether or not to take military action, because we’d have no idea what was going on inside of Iran.",7
2015-04-03,oba,Iran is not going to simply dismantle its program because we demand it to do so.,3
2015-04-03,oba,"That’s not how the world works, and that’s not what history shows us.",3
2015-04-03,oba,"Iran has shown no willingness to eliminate those aspects of their program that they maintain are for peaceful purposes, even in the face of unprecedented sanctions.",8
2015-04-03,oba,"Should negotiations collapse because we, the United States, rejected what the majority of the world considers a fair deal, what our scientists and nuclear experts suggest would give us confidence that they are not developing a nuclear weapon, it’s doubtful that we can even keep our current international sanctions in place.",8
2015-04-03,oba,"So when you hear the inevitable critics of the deal sound off, ask them a simple question:  Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the world’s major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East?",11
2015-04-03,oba,"Is it worse than doing what we’ve done for almost two decades, with Iran moving forward with its nuclear program and without robust inspections?",8
2015-04-03,oba,I think the answer will be clear.,3
2015-04-03,oba,"Remember, I have always insisted that I will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and I will.",7
2015-04-03,oba,"But I also know that a diplomatic solution is the best way to get this done, and offers a more comprehensive -- and lasting -- solution.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"It is our best option, by far.",2
2015-04-03,oba,"And while it is always a possibility that Iran may try to cheat on the deal in the future, this framework of inspections and transparency makes it far more likely that we’ll know about it if they try to cheat -- and I, or future Presidents, will have preserved all of the options that are currently available to deal with it.",9
2015-04-03,oba,"To the Iranian people, I want to reaffirm what I’ve said since the beginning of my presidency.",7
2015-04-03,oba,We are willing to engage you on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect.,8
2015-04-03,oba,This deal offers the prospect of relief from sanctions that were imposed because of Iran’s violation of international law.,8
2015-04-03,oba,"Since Iran’s Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons, this framework gives Iran the opportunity to verify that its program is, in fact, peaceful.",6
2015-04-03,oba,"It demonstrates that if Iran complies with its international obligations, then it can fully rejoin the community of nations, thereby fulfilling the extraordinary talent and aspirations of the Iranian people.",7
2015-04-03,oba,"That would be good for Iran, and it would be good for the world.",5
2015-04-03,oba,"Of course, this deal alone -- even if fully implemented -- will not end the deep divisions and mistrust between our two countries.",4
2015-04-03,oba,"We have a difficult history between us, and our concerns will remain with respect to Iranian behavior so long as Iran continues its sponsorship of terrorism, its support for proxies who destabilize the Middle East, its threats against America’s friends and allies -- like Israel.",8
2015-04-03,oba,So make no mistake: We will remain vigilant in countering those actions and standing with our allies.,7
2015-04-03,oba,It’s no secret that the Israeli Prime Minister and I don't agree about whether the United States should move forward with a peaceful resolution to the Iranian issue.,8
2015-04-03,oba,"If, in fact, Prime Minister Netanyahu is looking for the most effective way to ensure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon, this is the best option.",7
2015-04-03,oba,And I believe our nuclear experts can confirm that.,3
2015-04-03,oba,"More importantly, I will be speaking with the Prime Minister today to make clear that there will be no daylight, there is no daylight, when it comes to our support for Israel’s security and our concerns about Iran’s destabilizing policies and threats toward Israel.",10
2015-04-03,oba,"That’s why I've directed my national security team to consult closely with the new Israeli government in the coming weeks and months about how we can further strengthen our long-term security cooperation with Israel, and make clear our unshakeable commitment to Israel’s defense.",13
2015-04-03,oba,"Today, I also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia to reaffirm our commitment to the security of our partners in the Gulf.",7
2015-04-03,oba,"And I’m inviting the leaders of the six countries who make up the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain -- to meet me at Camp David this spring to discuss how we can further strengthen our security cooperation, while resolving the multiple conflicts that have caused so much hardship and instability throughout the Middle East.",11
2015-04-03,oba,"Finally, it’s worth remembering that Congress has, on a bipartisan basis, played a critical role in our current Iran policy, helping to shape the sanctions regime that applied so much pressure on Iran and ultimately forced them to the table.",8
2015-04-03,oba,"In the coming days and weeks, my administration will engage Congress once again about how we can play -- how it can play a constructive oversight role.",3
2015-04-03,oba,I’ll begin that effort by speaking to the leaders of the House and Senate today.,7
2015-04-03,oba,"In those conversations, I will underscore that the issues at stake here are bigger than politics.",4
2015-04-03,oba,"These are matters of war and peace, and they should be evaluated based on the facts and what is ultimately best for the American people and for our national security.",6
2015-04-03,oba,For this is not simply a deal between my administration and Iran.,4
2015-04-03,oba,"This is a deal between Iran, the United States of America, and the major powers in the world -- including some of our closest allies.",10
2015-04-03,oba,"If Congress kills this deal -- not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative -- then it’s the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy.",5
2015-04-03,oba,"International unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen.",4
2015-04-03,oba,"The American people understand this, which is why solid majorities support a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.",7
2015-04-03,oba,"They understand instinctively the words of President Kennedy, who faced down the far greater threat of communism, and said:  “Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.”1  The American people remember that at the height of the Cold War, Presidents like Nixon and Reagan struck historic arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, a far more dangerous adversary -- despite the fact that that adversary not only threatened to destroy our country and our way of life, but had the means to do so.",7
2015-04-03,oba,Those agreements were not perfect.,2
2015-04-03,oba,They did not end all threats.,2
2015-04-03,oba,But they made our world safer.,3
2015-04-03,oba,A good deal with Iran will do the same.,3
2015-04-03,oba,"Today, I’d like to express my thanks to our international partners for their steadfastness and their cooperation.",5
2015-04-03,oba,"I was able to speak earlier today with our close allies, Prime Minister Cameron and President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, to reaffirm that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder in this effort.",8
2015-04-03,oba,"And most of all, on behalf of our nation, I want to express my thanks to our tireless -- and I mean tireless -- Secretary of State John Kerry and our entire negotiating team.",5
2015-04-03,oba,They have worked so hard to make this progress.,3
2015-04-03,oba,They represent the best tradition of American diplomacy.,4
2015-04-03,oba,Their work -- our work -- is not yet done and success is not guaranteed.,3
2015-04-03,oba,"But we have an historic opportunity to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in Iran, and to do so peacefully, with the international community firmly behind us.",7
2015-04-03,oba,We should seize that chance.,2
2015-04-03,oba,Thank you.,1
2015-04-03,oba,God bless you.,1
2015-04-03,oba,God bless the United States of America.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"Hello, Oregon!",1
2015-05-09,oba,"Well, who arranged this day?",3
2015-05-09,oba,Every time I come to Oregon this is what it looks like.,4
2015-05-09,oba,Yeah!,1
2015-05-09,oba,"It never rains in Oregon, does it?",2
2015-05-09,oba,All right.,1
2015-05-09,oba,"Well, listen, it is wonderful to see all of you.",4
2015-05-09,oba,"First of all, please give Mark another round of applause for his hospitality.",4
2015-05-09,oba,"And thanks to everyone at Nike for hosting us today, here in “Federer Platz.”  You know, the White House is cool.",5
2015-05-09,oba,"We’ve got a basketball court -- actually, it's a tennis court that we repainted some lines -- when I came into office.",4
2015-05-09,oba,So it's a combination basketball-tennis court.,3
2015-05-09,oba,There is a putting green that President Eisenhower put in.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"Can you imagine, by the way, if I had put in a putting green?",3
2015-05-09,oba,Things have changed.,1
2015-05-09,oba,But you’ve got all that and the 18th tee box from Pebble Beach.,5
2015-05-09,oba,Come on.,1
2015-05-09,oba,I’m sure some of my staff is running around right now in the Michael Jordan and Mia Hamm buildings -- they want to be lab rats for your new gear.,7
2015-05-09,oba,But it is wonderful to be here.,2
2015-05-09,oba,Please give it up for two people who fight every single day for Oregon workers -- your Representatives in Congress -- they do a great job -- Earl Blumenauer and Suzanne Bonamici.,9
2015-05-09,oba,They are both here.,1
2015-05-09,oba,Give them a big round of applause.,3
2015-05-09,oba,Yay!,1
2015-05-09,oba,"And there are two people who couldn't make it here today, but they’re doing a great job and you should give them a round of applause as well, and that's Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Kurt Schrader.",5
2015-05-09,oba,So it is great to be at the world headquarters of such an iconic company -- a company that helps athletes succeed from the individual to the world stage.,7
2015-05-09,oba,"And as you’ve heard, I’ve come to Oregon to talk a little bit about trade -- which initially may have had some people thinking, what, is Mariota going someplace that we didn’t know about?",7
2015-05-09,oba,He’s going to be great.,2
2015-05-09,oba,He’s an outstanding young man.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"He’s going to be terrific -- and from Hawaii, by the way.",3
2015-05-09,oba,Local boy.,1
2015-05-09,oba,"But this is important, and I want to tell you why I think trade deals and our willingness to go out there and compete on the global stage is so important.",11
2015-05-09,oba,"Before I came out here, I had a chance to meet with some  small business owners from across Oregon, whose workers make everything from bikes to tea to stationery to wine.",10
2015-05-09,oba,And they know how important this is to them.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"Sometimes when we talk about trade, we think of Nike, or we think of Boeing, or we think of G.E.",4
2015-05-09,oba,-- we think about these big multinational companies.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"But those small business leaders came here today because they understood that these markets outside the United States will help them grow, and will help them hire more folks -- just as all the suppliers to Nike or Boeing or G.E.",6
2015-05-09,oba,or any of these other companies understand this is going to be critical to their growth and their ability to create new jobs.,9
2015-05-09,oba,"In fact, that’s why Ron Wyden is not here -- because he’s in Washington, D.C. as we speak quarterbacking this effort on behalf of Oregon’s small business owners and workers.",9
2015-05-09,oba,"Now, small businesses are the backbone of our economy.",4
2015-05-09,oba,"Eventually, like Nike, they grow sometimes into really, really big companies.",4
2015-05-09,oba,They employ millions of people; 98 percent of exporters are small businesses.,4
2015-05-09,oba,They’re the ones who make Made in Oregon and Made in the USA mean something.,6
2015-05-09,oba,"And they represent something essential about this country -- the notion that if you’ve got a good idea and you’re willing to work at it, you can turn that idea into a business, you can growth that business, and eventually, who knows what might happen.",10
2015-05-09,oba,You can give other people a chance to earn a living even as you do well.,4
2015-05-09,oba,That’s America’s promise.,3
2015-05-09,oba,And it’s up to us to keep that promise alive.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"Now, that promise was threatened for almost everybody just about seven years ago, when the economy nearly collapsed, and millions of Americans lost their jobs and their homes and their life savings.",6
2015-05-09,oba,But thanks to the hard work of the American people and entrepreneurs like the ones who are here today -- and some pretty good policies from my Administration -- we’re in a different place today.,9
2015-05-09,oba,We're in a different place today.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"This morning, we learned that our economy created 223,000 new jobs last month.",3
2015-05-09,oba,The unemployment rate ticked down again to 5.4 percent -- which is the lowest it’s been in almost seven years.,6
2015-05-09,oba,That’s 3 million new jobs over the past 12 months -- nearly the fastest pace in over a decade.,6
2015-05-09,oba,"And all told, over the past 62 months in a row, America’s businesses have created 12.3 million new jobs.",6
2015-05-09,oba,"I should add, by the way, 62 months ago is when I signed the Affordable Care Act.",5
2015-05-09,oba,"So, obviously, it hasn’t done too bad in terms of employment in this country.",5
2015-05-09,oba,I just thought I’d mention that.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"Since there were a lot of predictions of doom and gloom, I would just suggest those who were making those predictions go back and check the statistics.",7
2015-05-09,oba,Just saying.,1
2015-05-09,oba,So small businesses deserve a lot of credit for that.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"In fact, over the past several years, small businesses have created nearly two out of every three new American jobs.",4
2015-05-09,oba,"And the question is, how do we build on that success?",4
2015-05-09,oba,We’ve got to be relentless in our efforts to support small businesses who are creating jobs and helping to grow the economy.,10
2015-05-09,oba,And that’s been the purpose behind many of the policies I’ve fought for as President.,8
2015-05-09,oba,I’ve cut taxes for small businesses more than a dozen times.,4
2015-05-09,oba,I’ve pushed for investments in infrastructure and faster Internet.,5
2015-05-09,oba,"It’s why we’ve made health care more accessible, affordable, portable -- to give people the freedom to change jobs or launch that startup without worrying about losing their health insurance.",10
2015-05-09,oba,"And passing trade agreements is part of that agenda if those trade agreements are the right kinds of trade agreements; if they make sure that they’re growing our businesses, and helping American workers by selling goods Made in America across the rest of the world.",11
2015-05-09,oba,"And I’ve been talking a lot about this lately, because I view smart trade agreements as a vital piece of middle-class economics.",7
2015-05-09,oba,"Not a contradiction to middle-class economics, it’s a part and parcel of it.",5
2015-05-09,oba,"I believe that our country does best when everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules.",5
2015-05-09,oba,And that means making sure everybody has got a good education.,5
2015-05-09,oba,It means making sure that women are getting paid the same as men for doing the same work.,9
2015-05-09,oba,It means making sure that folks have to have sick leave and family leave and that they can balance work and family in a fair way.,7
2015-05-09,oba,"It means, working to increase the minimum wage all across this country -- because folks who have some of the toughest jobs oftentimes get the lowest pay.",7
2015-05-09,oba,"That’s all part of middle-class economics, but, you know what, so is trade.",7
2015-05-09,oba,"We strive to make sure our own economy lives up to high standards, but in a lot of parts of the world, the rules are unfair.",8
2015-05-09,oba,The playing field is uneven.,2
2015-05-09,oba,That puts American businesses and American workers at a disadvantage.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"So the question is, what should we do about it?",3
2015-05-09,oba,Some folks think we should just withdraw and not even try to engage in trade with these countries.,8
2015-05-09,oba,I disagree.,1
2015-05-09,oba,We have to make sure America writes the rules of the global economy.,7
2015-05-09,oba,"And we should do it today, while our economy is in the position of global strength.",6
2015-05-09,oba,Because if we don’t write the rules for trade around the world -- guess what -- China will.,8
2015-05-09,oba,"And they’ll write those rules in a way that gives Chinese workers and Chinese businesses the upper hand, and locks American-made goods out.",6
2015-05-09,oba,That’s the choice we face.,3
2015-05-09,oba,We're not going to be able to isolate ourselves from world markets.,6
2015-05-09,oba,We got to be in there and compete.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"And the question is, are we going to make sure that the rules are fair so that our businesses and our workers are on a level playing field.",8
2015-05-09,oba,"Because when they are, we win every time.",2
2015-05-09,oba,"When the rules are fair, we win every time.",3
2015-05-09,oba,So this is why I’m such a strong supporter of new trade agreements.,5
2015-05-09,oba,They're going to help our workers compete and our businesses compete.,5
2015-05-09,oba,"This is not a left issue or a right issue, or a business or a labor issue.",5
2015-05-09,oba,It is about fairness and equity and access.,4
2015-05-09,oba,"And like other issues that we’ve waged slow, steady fights on over the last seven years, this is also a question of the past versus the future.",6
2015-05-09,oba,"So the Trans-Pacific Partnership that we’re working on, it’s the biggest trade deal that we're working on right now -- has to do with the Asia Pacific region.",6
2015-05-09,oba,"And it reflects our values in ways that, frankly, some previous trade agreements did not.",6
2015-05-09,oba,"It’s the highest-standard, most progressive trade deal in history.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"It’s got strong, enforceable provisions for workers, preventing things like child labor.",5
2015-05-09,oba,"It’s got strong, enforceable provisions on the environment, helping us to do things that haven’t been done before, to prevent wildlife trafficking, or deforestation, or dealing with our oceans.",7
2015-05-09,oba,And these are enforceable in the agreement.,4
2015-05-09,oba,"And Nike operates in the Pacific region, so they understand the competitive pressures they're under.",4
2015-05-09,oba,Nike has factories all around the world.,4
2015-05-09,oba,"And let’s face it, Mark I think doesn't mind me saying it that some of these countries, they don't have the standards for wages and labor conditions that we have here.",8
2015-05-09,oba,"So when you look at a country like Vietnam, under this agreement, Vietnam would actually, for the first time, have to raise its labor standards.",5
2015-05-09,oba,It would have to set a minimum wage.,3
2015-05-09,oba,It would have to pass safe workplace laws to protect its workers.,4
2015-05-09,oba,It would even have to protect workers’ freedom to form unions -- for the very first time.,5
2015-05-09,oba,That would make a difference.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"That helps to level the playing field -- and it would be good for the workers in Vietnam, even as it helps make sure that they’re not undercutting competition here in the United States.",9
2015-05-09,oba,So that’s progress.,1
2015-05-09,oba,It doesn’t mean that suddenly working conditions in Vietnam will be like they are here at Nike.,4
2015-05-09,oba,Or here in Portland right away.,3
2015-05-09,oba,But it moves us in the right direction.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"And if Vietnam, or any of the other countries in this trade agreement don’t meet these requirements, they’ll face meaningful consequences.",8
2015-05-09,oba,"If you’re a country that wants in to this agreement, you have to meet higher standards.",7
2015-05-09,oba,"If you don’t, you’re out.",2
2015-05-09,oba,"If you break the rules, there are actual repercussions.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"And that’s good for American businesses and American workers, because we already meet higher standards than most of the rest of the world, and that helps level the playing field.",9
2015-05-09,oba,And this deal would strengthen our hand overseas by giving us the tools to open other markets to our goods and services and make sure they play by the fair rules we help write.,11
2015-05-09,oba,"The truth is, we have one of the most open markets in the world.",7
2015-05-09,oba,Folks are already selling stuff here.,1
2015-05-09,oba,We got to be able to sell there.,4
2015-05-09,oba,That requires us to enter into trade agreements to open up their markets.,4
2015-05-09,oba,I hear Oregon wine is actually pretty good.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"Somebody told me that the pinot noir in Oregon is top-notch, right?",4
2015-05-09,oba,I’ve got some winemakers right here.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"Well, I want to make sure Japanese wine consumers have the opportunity to partake -- in our excellent Oregon wine.",6
2015-05-09,oba,We got some Oregon beef producers and ranchers around here.,2
2015-05-09,oba,Beef is really expensive in Japan.,2
2015-05-09,oba,Let’s make sure they try some Oregon steaks.,5
2015-05-09,oba,It’s good stuff.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"And that’s one of the best things that can happen for our businesses and our workers -- opening up markets that have previously been closed, particularly markets where they’re already selling stuff here.",10
2015-05-09,oba,There’s a lack of reciprocity.,3
2015-05-09,oba,It’s not a fair deal right now.,2
2015-05-09,oba,We want to make it fair.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"Now, I want to acknowledge -- because this looks like a very well-read and informed crowd -- that there have been a bunch of critics about trade deals generally and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.",6
2015-05-09,oba,"And what’s interesting is typically they’re my friends, coming from my party, and they’re my fellow travelers on minimum wage and on job training and on clean energy.",8
2015-05-09,oba,"On every progressive issue, they’re right there with me.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"And then on this one, they’re like whooping on me.",4
2015-05-09,oba,But I tell you what.,1
2015-05-09,oba,"I’ve run my last election, and the only reason I do something is because I think it’s good for American workers and the American people and the American economy.",8
2015-05-09,oba,I don’t have any other rationale for doing what I do than I think it’s the best thing for the American people.,6
2015-05-09,oba,"And on this issue, on trade, I actually think some of my dearest friends are wrong.",5
2015-05-09,oba,They’re just wrong.,2
2015-05-09,oba,And here’s why.,1
2015-05-09,oba,"First of all, they say that this trade agreement will cost American jobs.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"And they’re really basing this on some past experience, looking at what happened in the ‘90s, over the last 20 years, as there was a lot of outsourcing going on.",6
2015-05-09,oba,"And you know what, past trade agreements, it’s true, didn’t always reflect our values or didn’t always do enough to protect American workers.",5
2015-05-09,oba,But that’s why we’re designing a different kind of trade deal.,5
2015-05-09,oba,"And the truth is that companies that only care about low wages, they’ve already moved.",6
2015-05-09,oba,They don’t need new trade deals to move.,3
2015-05-09,oba,They’ve already outsourced.,1
2015-05-09,oba,They’ve already located in search of low wages.,5
2015-05-09,oba,"What this trade agreement would do is open the doors to the higher-skill, higher-wage jobs of the future -- jobs that we excel at.",7
2015-05-09,oba,It would make sure our manufacturers who are operating at the higher end of the value chain are able to access these growing markets.,9
2015-05-09,oba,"And the fact is, over the past few years, our manufacturers have been steadily creating jobs for the first time since the 1990s -- under my Administration.",6
2015-05-09,oba,"After more than a decade away from the top spot, business leaders around the world have declared the United States is the world’s number one place to invest for a third year in a row.",6
2015-05-09,oba,Third year in a row.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"So the point is, outsourcing is already giving way to insourcing.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"Companies are starting to move back here to do more advanced manufacturing, and this is a trend we expect to continue.",5
2015-05-09,oba,This trade deal would help that.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"Just this morning, as Mark may have mentioned, Nike announced that, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it will make new investments in advanced manufacturing -- not overseas, but right here in the United States.",5
2015-05-09,oba,"And far more Nike products would be made in the U.S.A.  And that means thousands of new jobs in manufacturing and engineering and design at Nike facilities across the country, and potentially tens of thousands of new jobs along Nike’s supply chain here at home.",3
2015-05-09,oba,That’s what trade can do.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"Look, I’ve spent six and a half years trying to rescue this economy -- six and a half years of trying to revitalize American manufacturing, including rescuing an American auto industry that was on its back and is now fully recovered.",13
2015-05-09,oba,So I would not risk any of that if I thought the trade deals were going to undermine it.,4
2015-05-09,oba,The reason I’m for this is because I think it will enhance it and advance it.,4
2015-05-09,oba,So that’s point number one.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"Point number two -- when you ask folks specifically, what do you oppose about this trade deal, they just say “NAFTA.”  NAFTA was passed 20 years ago.",4
2015-05-09,oba,That was a different agreement.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"And in fact, this agreement fixes some of what was wrong with NAFTA by making labor and environmental provisions actually enforceable.",9
2015-05-09,oba,I was just getting out of law school when NAFTA got passed.,4
2015-05-09,oba,"Number three -- you’ve got some critics saying that any deal would be rushed through; it’s a secret deal, people don’t know what’s in it.",6
2015-05-09,oba,This is not true.,1
2015-05-09,oba,Any agreement that we finalize with the other 11 countries will have to be posted online for at least 60 days before I even sign it.,5
2015-05-09,oba,Then it would go to Congress -- and you know they’re not going to do anything fast.,3
2015-05-09,oba,So there will be months of review.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"Every T crossed, every I dotted.",3
2015-05-09,oba,Everybody is going to be able to see exactly what’s in it.,6
2015-05-09,oba,There’s nothing fast-track about this.,3
2015-05-09,oba,This is a very deliberate track -- which will be fully subject to scrutiny.,5
2015-05-09,oba,"And I’m confident when people read the agreement for themselves, they’ll see that this is the most progressive trade deal in history.",5
2015-05-09,oba,"Number four -- critics warn that parts of this deal would undermine American regulation -- food safety, worker safety, even financial regulations.",6
2015-05-09,oba,They’re making this stuff up.,2
2015-05-09,oba,This is just not true.,1
2015-05-09,oba,No trade agreement is going to force us to change our laws.,4
2015-05-09,oba,This agreement would make sure our companies aren’t discriminated against in other countries.,5
2015-05-09,oba,We already treat companies from other countries fairly here.,4
2015-05-09,oba,But our companies don’t always get treated fairly there.,2
2015-05-09,oba,So sometimes they need to have some way to settle disputes where it’s not subject to the whims of some government bureaucrat in that country.,12
2015-05-09,oba,That’s important.,1
2015-05-09,oba,We want our businesses to succeed in selling over there because that's how our workers will get more jobs here in the United States.,6
2015-05-09,oba,"And then finally, some critics talk about currency manipulation.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"Now, this has been a problem in the past.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"Some countries, they try to lower their currency so that it makes their goods cheaper, makes our more expensive.",5
2015-05-09,oba,There was a time when China was pretty egregious about this.,5
2015-05-09,oba,"When I came into office, I started pounding on them.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"Every time I meet with them, I’d be talking about currency.",4
2015-05-09,oba,"And we pushed back hard, and China moved.",2
2015-05-09,oba,"In real terms, their currency has appreciated about 30 percent since I came into office.",3
2015-05-09,oba,And we're going to keep on going after it.,4
2015-05-09,oba,But that’s not an argument against this trade agreement.,4
2015-05-09,oba,"If we give up the chance to help our businesses sell their stuff in the world’s fastest-growing markets, that doesn't do anything to stop currency manipulation.",8
2015-05-09,oba,"So the fact is, some folks are just opposed to trade deals out of principle, a reflexive principle.",7
2015-05-09,oba,"And what I tell them is, you know what, if you're opposed to these smart, progressive trade deals, then that means you must be satisfied with the status quo.",7
2015-05-09,oba,And the status quo hasn’t been working for our workers.,3
2015-05-09,oba,It hasn’t been working for our businesses.,3
2015-05-09,oba,And there are people here who will tell you why.,3
2015-05-09,oba,I’m going to just give you a couple of examples of small businesses who I had a chance to meet with today.,11
2015-05-09,oba,Egg Press is a Portland-based greeting card company.,3
2015-05-09,oba,Really nice.,1
2015-05-09,oba,"They sell their cards in Australia, which is a member of this Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.",8
2015-05-09,oba,"Their CEO, Tess Darrow -- where’s Tess?",2
2015-05-09,oba,Raise your hand.,2
2015-05-09,oba,I saw her.,1
2015-05-09,oba,There she is.,1
2015-05-09,oba,"So Tess says that if they could more easily reach customers in Japan, as well, they’d sell half the volume that they do here in America.",5
2015-05-09,oba,That’s a lot.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"Right now, the logistics of exporting to Japan are too complicated.",5
2015-05-09,oba,Products end up being held up for months at the border.,6
2015-05-09,oba,This agreement would help solve some of those problems so Tess can sell more greeting cards in Japan -- presumably in Japanese.,5
2015-05-09,oba,"Is there going to be -- there will be a translation process, I assume.",4
2015-05-09,oba,"Yes, absolutely.",1
2015-05-09,oba,I’m teasing.,1
2015-05-09,oba,"So the trade deal would help eliminate barriers, and simplify customs, and hold countries accountable for getting products delivered swiftly.",7
2015-05-09,oba,"The more Tess sells, the more she can grow, the more she can hire here in Oregon, here in the United States.",4
2015-05-09,oba,"Oregon Fruit Products -- makes canned fruits, berries, other products -- depends on exports for 20 percent of its annual sales.",8
2015-05-09,oba,"Right now, it exports to four members of this partnership that we're putting together:  Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Canada.",7
2015-05-09,oba,"Unfortunately, selling in these countries right now can mean dealing with unfair rules designed to prevent our products from being offered in their markets.",10
2015-05-09,oba,"Under this agreement, that would change.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"Exporting becomes simpler, more consistent.",2
2015-05-09,oba,That means more people around the world eating Oregon berries all year long.,4
2015-05-09,oba,Berry tasty.,1
2015-05-09,oba,Sokol Blosser Winery -- we got a lot of drinkers here.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"It’s a winery, family-run in Dayton, Oregon.",4
2015-05-09,oba,One of its top export markets is Japan.,4
2015-05-09,oba,"Right now, there are high tariffs on American wine in that country.",4
2015-05-09,oba,"Under this trade partnership, those tariffs would be eliminated, and wineries across America could see their sales grow overseas.",4
2015-05-09,oba,"The brother  --and-sister team that runs this vineyard -- wave, guys -- they say, “If we can make it easier to do business with countries that are already our trading partners, countries that are allies, that’s a good thing.”

They’re right.",10
2015-05-09,oba,This deal would be a good thing.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"So let’s “just do it.”  It took a while for you to catch that, didn’t it?",2
2015-05-09,oba,I thought that was pretty obvious.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"So, listen, I know a lot of folks who are skeptical about trade.",7
2015-05-09,oba,Past trade deals didn’t always live up to the hype.,3
2015-05-09,oba,Labor and environmental protections weren’t always strong enough.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"I saw for years, in Chicago and towns across Illinois, manufacturing collapsing, jobs drying up.",5
2015-05-09,oba,Outsourcing is real.,1
2015-05-09,oba,Folks didn’t just make that up.,1
2015-05-09,oba,"Some of our manufacturing base shifted over the last 25 years, and it wasn’t good for manufacturing and it wasn’t good for those communities, and it wasn’t good for workers.",6
2015-05-09,oba,That’s the truth.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"It had benefits -- other jobs were created, we got cheaper goods.",4
2015-05-09,oba,But there was real displacement and real pain.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"And so, for many Americans, this is not an abstraction; this is real.",4
2015-05-09,oba,But we’ve got to learn the right lessons from that.,4
2015-05-09,oba,The lesson is not that we pull up the drawbridge and build a moat around ourselves.,4
2015-05-09,oba,"The lesson is, is that we’ve got to make sure that the trade deals that we do shape are ones that allow us to compete fairly.",7
2015-05-09,oba,"So when I took office, I decided we could rethink the way we do trade in a way that actually works for working Americans.",7
2015-05-09,oba,I didn’t think this was the right thing to do just for companies.,5
2015-05-09,oba,"If I didn’t think this was the right thing to do for working families, I would not be fighting for it.",7
2015-05-09,oba,"If any agreement undercuts working families, I won’t sign it.",3
2015-05-09,oba,"I ran for office to expand opportunity for everybody -- the all-American idea that no matter who you are, or where you come from, or how you started out, or who you love, in America you can make it if you try.",10
2015-05-09,oba,"So, yes, we should be mindful of the past, but we can’t ignore the realities of the new economy.",5
2015-05-09,oba,We can’t stand on the beaches and stop the global economy at our shores.,4
2015-05-09,oba,We’ve got to harness it on our terms.,4
2015-05-09,oba,This century is built for us.,2
2015-05-09,oba,It’s about innovation.,2
2015-05-09,oba,"It’s about dynamism and flexibility and entrepreneurship, and information and knowledge and science and research.",6
2015-05-09,oba,That’s us.,1
2015-05-09,oba,So we can’t be afraid of it; we’ve got to seize it.,4
2015-05-09,oba,"We’ve got to give every single American who wakes up, sends their kids to school, rolls up their sleeves, punches in every day the chance to do what they do best:  dream up, innovate, build, sell the best products and ideas in the world to every corner of the world.",12
2015-05-09,oba,"Because, Nike, we do not just have the best athletes in the world.",4
2015-05-09,oba,We also have the best workers in the world.,4
2015-05-09,oba,We also have the best businesses in the world.,4
2015-05-09,oba,"And when the playing field is level, nobody beats the United States of America.",3
2015-05-09,oba,Nobody beats the United States of America.,3
2015-05-09,oba,"Just do it, everybody.",1
2015-05-09,oba,Thank you.,1
2015-05-09,oba,God bless you.,1

2015-06-18,oba,"This morning, I spoke with, and Vice President Biden spoke with, Mayor Joe Riley and other leaders of Charleston to express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders that took place last night.",7
2015-06-18,oba,Michelle and I know several members of Emanuel AME Church.,5
2015-06-18,oba,"We knew their pastor, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who, along with eight others, gathered in prayer and fellowship and was murdered last night.",6
2015-06-18,oba,"And to say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families, and their community doesn’t say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel.",8
2015-06-18,oba,Any death of this sort is a tragedy.,4
2015-06-18,oba,Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy.,4
2015-06-18,oba,"There is something particularly heartbreaking about the death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship.",12
2015-06-18,oba,"Mother Emanuel is, in fact, more than a church.",4
2015-06-18,oba,This is a place of worship that was founded by African Americans seeking liberty.,6
2015-06-18,oba,This is a church that was burned to the ground because its worships -- worshipers worked to end slavery.,5
2015-06-18,oba,"When there were laws banning all-black church gatherings, they conducted services in secret.",6
2015-06-18,oba,"When there was a nonviolent movement to bring our country closer in line with our highest ideals, some of our brightest leaders spoke and led marches from this church’s steps.",9

2015-06-18,oba,"The FBI is now on the scene with local police, and more of the Bureau’s best are on the way to join them.",6
2015-06-18,oba,The Attorney General has announced plans for the FBI to open a hate crime investigation.,5
2015-06-18,oba,We understand that the suspect is in custody.,3
2015-06-18,oba,And I’ll let the best of law enforcement do its work to make sure that justice is served.,5
2015-06-18,oba,"Until the investigation is complete, I’m necessarily constrained in terms of talking about the details of the case.",9
2015-06-18,oba,But I don’t need to be constrained about the emotions that tragedies like this raise.,7
2015-06-18,oba,I’ve had to make statements like this too many times.,6
2015-06-18,oba,Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times.,4
2015-06-18,oba,"We don’t have all the facts, but we do know that, once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun.",8
2015-06-18,oba,Now is the time for mourning and for healing.,4
2015-06-18,oba,"But let’s be clear:  At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.",9
2015-06-18,oba,It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency.,6
2015-06-18,oba,And it is in our power to do something about it.,6
2015-06-18,oba,I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now.,6
2015-06-18,oba,But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it.,2
2015-06-18,oba,"And at some point it’s going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it, and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively.",9
2015-06-18,oba,The fact that this took place in a black church obviously also raises questions about a dark part of our history.,6
2015-06-18,oba,This is not the first time that black churches have been attacked.,4
2015-06-18,oba,And we know that hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals.,6
2015-06-18,oba,"The good news is I am confident that the outpouring of unity and strength and fellowship and love across Charleston today, from all races, from all faiths, from all places of worship indicates the degree to which those old vestiges of hatred can be overcome.",9
2015-06-18,oba,"That, certainly, was Dr. King’s hope just over 50 years ago, after four little girls were killed in a bombing in a black church in Birmingham, Alabama.",8

2015-06-18,oba,"Their death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American Dream.1

    And if one will hold on, he will discover that God walks with him, and that God is able to lift you from the fatigue of despair to the buoyancy of hope, and transform dark and desolate valleys into sunlit paths of inner peace.2

Reverend Pinckney and his congregation understood that spirit.",11
2015-06-18,oba,"Their Christian faith compelled them to reach out not just to members of their congregation, or to members of their own communities, but to all in need.",7
2015-06-18,oba,They opened their doors to strangers who might enter a church in search of healing or redemption.,9
2015-06-18,oba,"Mother Emanuel church and its congregation have risen before -- from flames, from an earthquake, from other dark times -- to give hope to generations of Charlestonians.",5

2015-07-07,oba,I just met with my national security team as part of our regular effort to assess our efforts -- what’s working and what we can do better.,8
2015-07-07,oba,"Secretary Carter, Chairman Dempsey, I want to thank you and your team for welcoming us and for your leadership, including General Austin who’s leading the military campaign.",9
2015-07-07,oba,And I want to summarize briefly where we stand.,3
2015-07-07,oba,I want to start by repeating what I’ve said since the beginning.,7
2015-07-07,oba,This will not be quick.,1
2015-07-07,oba,This is a long-term campaign.,3
2015-07-07,oba,ISIL is opportunistic and it is nimble.,2
2015-07-07,oba,"In many places in Syria and Iraq, including urban areas, it’s dug in among innocent civilian populations.",5
2015-07-07,oba,"It will take time to root them out -- and doing so must be the job of local forces on the ground, with training and air support from our coalition.",7
2015-07-07,oba,"As with any military effort, there will be periods of progress, but there are also going to be some setbacks -- as we’ve seen with ISIL’s gains in Ramadi in Iraq and central and southern Syria.",7
2015-07-07,oba,"But today, it’s also important for us to recognize the progress that's been made.",4
2015-07-07,oba,"Our coalition has now hit ISIL with more than 5,000 airstrikes.",4
2015-07-07,oba,"We’ve taken out thousands of fighting positions, tanks, vehicles, bomb factories, and training camps.",8
2015-07-07,oba,"We’ve eliminated thousands of fighters, including senior ISIL commanders.",4
2015-07-07,oba,"And over the past year, we’ve seen that when we have an effective partner on the ground, ISIL can be pushed back.",6
2015-07-07,oba,"In Iraq, ISIL lost at the Mosul Dam.",3
2015-07-07,oba,ISIL lost at Mount Sinjar.,3
2015-07-07,oba,ISIL has lost repeatedly across Kirkuk Province.,3
2015-07-07,oba,ISIL lost at Tikrit.,2
2015-07-07,oba,"Altogether, ISIL has lost more than a quarter of the populated areas that it had seized in Iraq.",6
2015-07-07,oba,"In Syria, ISIL lost at Kobani.",2
2015-07-07,oba,"It’s recently endured losses across northern Syria, including the key city of Tal Abyad, denying ISIL a vital supply route to Raqqa, its base of operations in Syria.",9
2015-07-07,oba,So these are reminders that ISIL’s strategic weaknesses are real.,5
2015-07-07,oba,ISIL is surrounded by countries and communities committed to its destruction.,4
2015-07-07,oba,It has no air force; our coalition owns the skies.,3
2015-07-07,oba,ISIL is backed by no nation.,3
2015-07-07,oba,"It relies on fear, sometimes executing its own disillusioned fighters.",3
2015-07-07,oba,"Its unrestrained brutality often alienates those under its rule, creating new enemies.",4
2015-07-07,oba,"In short, ISIL’s recent losses in both Syria and Iraq prove that ISIL can and will be defeated.",5
2015-07-07,oba,"Indeed, we’re intensifying our efforts against ISIL’s base in Syria.",5
2015-07-07,oba,Our airstrikes will continue to target the oil and gas facilities that fund so much of their operations.,7
2015-07-07,oba,We’re going after the ISIL leadership and infrastructure in Syria -- the heart of ISIL that pumps funds and propaganda to people around the world.,8
2015-07-07,oba,"Partnering with other countries -- sharing more information, strengthening laws and border security -- allows us to work to stem the flow of foreign fighters to Syria as well as Iraq, and to stem, obviously, the flow of those fighters back into our own countries.",8
2015-07-07,oba,"This continues to be a challenge, and, working together, all our nations are going to need to do more, but we're starting to see some progress.",5
2015-07-07,oba,We’ll continue cracking down on ISIL’s illicit finance around the world.,6
2015-07-07,oba,"By the way, if Congress really wants to help in this effort, they can confirm Mr. Adam Szubin, our nominee for Treasury Under Secretary to lead this effort.",5
2015-07-07,oba,This is a vital position to our counterterrorism efforts.,4
2015-07-07,oba,Nobody suggests Mr. Szubin is not qualified.,3
2015-07-07,oba,He’s highly qualified.,2
2015-07-07,oba,"Unfortunately, his nomination has been languishing up on the Hill, and we need the Senate to confirm him as soon as possible.",5
2015-07-07,oba,"Meanwhile, we continue to ramp up our training and support of local forces that are fighting ISIL on the ground.",9
2015-07-07,oba,"As I’ve said before, this aspect of our strategy was moving too slowly.",4
2015-07-07,oba,But the fall of Ramadi has galvanized the Iraqi government.,3
2015-07-07,oba,"So, with the additional steps I ordered last month, we’re speeding up training of ISIL forces, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar Province.",10
2015-07-07,oba,More Sunni volunteers are coming forward.,2
2015-07-07,oba,"Some are already being trained, and they can be a new force against ISIL.",4
2015-07-07,oba,"We continue to accelerate the delivery of critical equipment, including anti-tank weapons, to Iraqi security forces, including the Peshmerga and tribal fighters.",7
2015-07-07,oba,And I made it clear to my team that we will do more to train and equip the moderate opposition in Syria.,7
2015-07-07,oba,"Now, all this said, our strategy recognizes that no amount of military force will end the terror that is ISIL unless it’s matched by a broader effort -- political and economic -- that addresses the underlying conditions that have allowed ISIL to gain traction.",9
2015-07-07,oba,"They have filled a void, and we have to make sure that as we push them out that void is filled.",7
2015-07-07,oba,"So, as Iraqi cities and towns are liberated from ISIL, we’re working with Iraq and the United Nations to help communities rebuild the security, services and governance that they need.",5
2015-07-07,oba,"We continue to support the efforts of Prime Minister Abadi to forge an inclusive and effective Iraqi government that unites all the people of Iraq -- Shia, Sunnis, Kurds and all minority communities.",11
2015-07-07,oba,"In Syria, the only way that the civil war will end -- and in a way so that the Syrian people can unite against ISIL -- is an inclusive political transition to a new government, without Bashar Assad -- a government that serves all Syrians.",6
2015-07-07,oba,I discussed this with our Gulf Cooperation Council partners at Camp David and during my recent call with President Putin.,8
2015-07-07,oba,I made it clear the United States will continue to work for such a transition.,5
2015-07-07,oba,"And a glimmer of good news is I think an increasing recognition on the part of all the players in the region that given the extraordinary threat that ISIL poses it is important for us to work together, as opposed to at cross-purposes, to make sure that an inclusive Syrian government exists.",11
2015-07-07,oba,"While the focus of our discussions today was on Iraq and Syria, ISIL and its ideology also obviously pose a grave threat beyond the region.",7
2015-07-07,oba,"In recent weeks we’ve seen deadly attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula.",7
2015-07-07,oba,"We see a growing ISIL presence in Libya and attempts to establish footholds across North Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Southeast Asia.",9
2015-07-07,oba,"We’ve seen attacks in Ottawa, Sydney, France and Copenhagen.",6
2015-07-07,oba,So I’ve called on the international community to unite against this scourge of violent extremism.,6
2015-07-07,oba,"In this fight, the United States continues to lead.",3
2015-07-07,oba,"When necessary to prevent attacks against our nation, we’ll take direct action against terrorists.",6
2015-07-07,oba,We’ll continue to also partner with nations from Afghanistan to Nigeria to build up their security forces.,5
2015-07-07,oba,"We’re going to work day and night with allies and partners to disrupt terrorist networks and thwart attacks, and to smother nascent ISIL cells that may be trying to develop in other parts of the world.",9
2015-07-07,oba,This also includes remaining vigilant in protecting against attacks here in the homeland.,10
2015-07-07,oba,"Now, I think it's important for us to recognize the threat of violent extremism is not restricted to any one community.",6
2015-07-07,oba,"Here in the United States, we’ve seen all kinds of homegrown terrorism.",4
2015-07-07,oba,"And tragically, recent history reminds us how even a single individual motivated by a hateful ideology with access to dangerous weapons can inflict horrendous harm on Americans.",8
2015-07-07,oba,"So our efforts to counter violent extremism must not target any one community because of their faith or background, including patriotic Muslim Americans who are our partners in keeping our country safe.",9
2015-07-07,oba,"That said, we also have to acknowledge that ISIL has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world, including here in the United States.",12
2015-07-07,oba,And they are targeting Muslim communities around the world.,4
2015-07-07,oba,Numerous individuals have been arrested across the country for plotting attacks or attempting to join ISIL in Syria and Iraq.,8
2015-07-07,oba,"Two men apparently inspired by ISIL opened fire in Garland, Texas.",4
2015-07-07,oba,"And because of our success over the years in improving our homeland security, we’ve made it harder for terrorists to carry out large-scale attacks like 9/11 here at home.",8
2015-07-07,oba,But the threat of lone wolves or small cells of terrorists is complex -- it's harder to detect and harder to prevent.,7
2015-07-07,oba,It’s one of the most difficult challenges that we face.,5
2015-07-07,oba,And preventing these kinds of attacks on American soil is going to require sustained effort.,7
2015-07-07,oba,"So I just want to repeat, the good news is that because of extraordinary efforts from law enforcement as well as our military intelligence, we are doing a better job at preventing any large-scale attacks on the homeland.",8
2015-07-07,oba,"On the other hand, the small, individual lone wolf attacks or small cells become harder to detect and they become more sophisticated, using new technologies.",4
2015-07-07,oba,And that means that we're going to have to pick up our game to prevent these attacks.,6
2015-07-07,oba,"It's also true why, ultimately, in order for us to defeat terrorist groups like ISIL and al Qaeda it's going to also require us to discredit their ideology -- the twisted thinking that draws vulnerable people into their ranks.",9
2015-07-07,oba,As I’ve said before -- and I know our military leaders agree -- this broader challenge of countering violent extremism is not simply a military effort.,5
2015-07-07,oba,Ideologies are not defeated with guns; they’re defeated by better ideas -- a more attractive and more compelling vision.,6
2015-07-07,oba,"So the United States will continue to do our part, by working with partners to counter ISIL’s hateful propaganda, especially online.",7
2015-07-07,oba,We’ll constantly reaffirm through words and deeds that we will never be at war with Islam.,5
2015-07-07,oba,We’re fighting terrorists who distort Islam and whose victims are mostly Muslims.,5
2015-07-07,oba,"But around the world, we’re also going to insist on partnering with Muslim communities as they seek security, prosperity and the dignity that they deserve.",9
2015-07-07,oba,"And we're going to expect those communities to step up in terms of pushing back as hard as they can, in conjunction with other people of goodwill, against these hateful ideologies in order to discredit them more effectively, particularly when it comes to what we're teaching young people.",12
2015-07-07,oba,And this larger battle for hearts and minds is going to be a generational struggle.,4
2015-07-07,oba,It's ultimately not going to be won or lost by the United States alone.,5
2015-07-07,oba,It will be decided by the countries and the communities that terrorists like ISIL target.,7
2015-07-07,oba,"It’s going to be up to Muslim communities, including scholars and clerics, to keep rejecting warped interpretations of Islam, and to protect their sons and daughters from recruitment.",7
2015-07-07,oba,It will be up to all people -- leaders and citizens -- to reject the sectarianism that so often fuels the resentments and conflicts upon which terrorists are currently thriving.,7
2015-07-07,oba,It will be up to governments to address the political and economic grievances that terrorists exploit.,4
2015-07-07,oba,"Nations that empower citizens to decide their own destiny, that uphold human rights for all their people, that invest in education and create opportunities for their young people -- those can be powerful antidotes to extremist ideologies.",7
2015-07-07,oba,Those are the countries that will find a true partner in the United States.,6
2015-07-07,oba,"In closing, let me note that this Fourth of July we celebrated 239 years of American independence.",6
2015-07-07,oba,"Across more than two centuries, we’ve faced much bigger, much more formidable challenges than this -- Civil War, a Great Depression, fascism, communism, terrible natural disasters, 9/11.",9
2015-07-07,oba,"And every time, every generation, our nation has risen to the moment.",3
2015-07-07,oba,We don’t simply endure; we emerge stronger than before.,3
2015-07-07,oba,And that will be the case here.,2
2015-07-07,oba,Our mission to destroy ISIL and to keep our country safe will be difficult.,5
2015-07-07,oba,It will take time.,1
2015-07-07,oba,There will be setbacks as well as progress.,3
2015-07-07,oba,"But as President and Commander-in-Chief, I want to say to all our men and women in uniform who are serving in this operation -- our pilots, the crews on the ground, our personnel not only on the ground but at sea, our intelligence teams and our diplomatic teams -- I want to thank you.",8
2015-07-07,oba,"We are proud of you, and you have my total confidence that you’re going to succeed.",5
2015-07-07,oba,"To the American people, I want to say we will continue to be vigilant.",4

2015-07-07,oba,"And just as we have for more than two centuries, we will ultimately prevail.",4
2015-07-07,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2015-07-07,oba,And thanks to the team up on the stage here with me -- they’re doing an outstanding job.,5
2015-08-03,oba,"Well, good afternoon everybody.",2
2015-08-03,oba,"Gina, I want to thank you not just for the introduction, but for the incredible work that you and your team have been doing -- not just on this issue, but on generally making sure that we've got clean air, clean water, a great future for our kids.",11
2015-08-03,oba,"I want to thank all the members of Congress who are here, as well, who have been fighting this issue, and sometimes at great odds with others, but are willing to take on what is going to be one of the key challenges of our lifetimes and future generations.",12
2015-08-03,oba,"I want to thank our Surgeon General, who’s just been doing outstanding work and is helping to make the connection between this critical issue and the health of our families.",12
2015-08-03,oba,"Over the past six and a half years, we've taken on some of the toughest challenges of our time -- from rebuilding our economy after a devastating recession, to ending our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and bringing almost all of our troops home, to strengthening our security through tough and principled diplomacy.",9
2015-08-03,oba,But I am convinced that no challenge poses a greater threat to our future and future generations than a changing climate.,8
2015-08-03,oba,And that's what brings us here today.,2
2015-08-03,oba,"Now, not everyone here is a scientist -- but some of you are among the best scientists in the world.",6
2015-08-03,oba,And what you and your colleagues have been showing us for years now is that human activities are changing the climate in dangerous ways.,4
2015-08-03,oba,"Levels of carbon dioxide, which heats up our atmosphere, are higher than they’ve been in 800,000 years; 2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.",7
2015-08-03,oba,And we've been setting a lot of records in terms of warmest years over the last decade.,5
2015-08-03,oba,"One year doesn’t make a trend, but 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have fallen within the first 15 years of this century.",6
2015-08-03,oba,"Climate change is no longer just about the future that we're predicting for our children or our grandchildren; it's about the reality that we're living with every day, right now.",8
2015-08-03,oba,The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.,4
2015-08-03,oba,"While we can't say any single weather event is entirely caused by climate change, we've seen stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons.",5
2015-08-03,oba,Charleston and Miami now flood at high tide.,3
2015-08-03,oba,Shrinking ice caps forced National Geographic to make the biggest change in its atlas since the Soviet Union broke apart.,5
2015-08-03,oba,"Over the past three decades, nationwide asthma rates have more than doubled, and climate change puts those Americans at greater risk of landing in the hospital.",8
2015-08-03,oba,"As one of America’s governors has said, “We're the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.”

And that's why I committed the United States to leading the world on this challenge, because I believe there is such a thing as being too late.",9
2015-08-03,oba,"Most of the issues that I deal with -- and I deal with some tough issues that cross my desk -- by definition, I don't deal with issues if they’re easy to solve because somebody else has already solved them.",7
2015-08-03,oba,And some of them are grim.,3
2015-08-03,oba,Some of them are heartbreaking.,3
2015-08-03,oba,Some of them are hard.,3
2015-08-03,oba,Some of them are frustrating.,3
2015-08-03,oba,"But most of the time, the issues we deal with are ones that are temporally bound and we can anticipate things getting better if we just kind of plug away at it, even incrementally.",5
2015-08-03,oba,"But this is one of those rare issues -- because of its magnitude, because of its scope -- that if we don't get it right we may not be able to reverse, and we may not be able to adapt sufficiently.",4
2015-08-03,oba,There is such a thing as being too late when it comes to climate change.,7
2015-08-03,oba,"Now, that shouldn’t make us hopeless; it's not as if there’s nothing we can do about it.",5
2015-08-03,oba,We can take action.,1
2015-08-03,oba,"Over the past several years, America has been working to use less dirty energy, more clean energy, waste less energy throughout our economy.",5
2015-08-03,oba,We've set new fuel economy standards that mean our cars will go twice as far on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade.,8
2015-08-03,oba,"Combined with lower gas prices, these standards are on pace to save drivers an average of $700 at the pump this year.",5
2015-08-03,oba,We doubled down on our investment in renewable energy.,5
2015-08-03,oba,"We're generating three times as much wind power, 20 times as much solar power as we did in 2008.",5
2015-08-03,oba,These steps are making a difference.,2
2015-08-03,oba,"Over the past decade, even as our economy has continued to grow, the United States has cut our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.",5
2015-08-03,oba,That's the good news.,2
2015-08-03,oba,"But I am here to say that if we want to protect our economy and our security and our children’s health, we're going to have to do more.",9
2015-08-03,oba,The science tells us we have to do more.,3
2015-08-03,oba,This has been our focus these past six years.,2
2015-08-03,oba,And it's particularly going to be our focus this month.,3
2015-08-03,oba,"In Nevada, later in August, I'll talk about the extraordinary progress we've made in generating clean energy -- and the jobs that come with it -- and how we can boost that even further.",7
2015-08-03,oba,"I'll also be the first American President to visit the Alaskan Arctic, where our fellow Americans have already seen their communities devastated by melting ice and rising oceans, the impact on marine life.",9
2015-08-03,oba,We're going to talk about what the world needs to do together to prevent the worst impacts of climate change before it's too late.,9
2015-08-03,oba,"And today, we're here to announce America’s Clean Power Plan -- a plan two years in the making, and the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change.",7
2015-08-03,oba,"Right now, our power plants are the source of about a third of America’s carbon pollution.",7
2015-08-03,oba,"That's more pollution than our cars, our airplanes and our homes generate combined.",6
2015-08-03,oba,"That pollution contributes to climate change, which degrades the air our kids breathe.",7
2015-08-03,oba,But there have never been federal limits on the amount of carbon that power plants can dump into the air.,5
2015-08-03,oba,Think about that.,2
2015-08-03,oba,We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur and arsenic in our air or our water -- and we're better off for it.,7
2015-08-03,oba,But existing power plants can still dump unlimited amounts of harmful carbon pollution into the air.,4
2015-08-03,oba,"For the sake of our kids and the health and safety of all Americans, that has to change.",8
2015-08-03,oba,"For the sake of the planet, that has to change.",5
2015-08-03,oba,"So, two years ago, I directed Gina and the Environmental Protection Agency to take on this challenge.",4
2015-08-03,oba,"And today, after working with states and cities and power companies, the EPA is setting the first-ever nationwide standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from power plants.",7
2015-08-03,oba,Here’s how it works.,2
2015-08-03,oba,"Over the next few years, each state will have the change to put together its own plan for reducing emissions -- because every state has a different energy mix.",6
2015-08-03,oba,"Some generate more of their power from renewables; some from natural gas, or nuclear, or coal.",6
2015-08-03,oba,And this plan reflects the fact that not everybody is starting in the same place.,5
2015-08-03,oba,So we're giving states the time and the flexibility they need to cut pollution in a way that works for them.,9
2015-08-03,oba,And we'll reward the states that take action sooner instead of later -- because time is not on our side here.,4
2015-08-03,oba,"As states work to meet their targets, they can build on the progress that our communities and businesses are already making.",5
2015-08-03,oba,"A lot of power companies have already begun modernizing their plants, reducing their emissions -- and by the way, creating new jobs in the process.",4
2015-08-03,oba,Nearly a dozen states have already set up their own market-based programs to reduce carbon pollution.,3
2015-08-03,oba,About half of our states have set energy efficiency targets.,4
2015-08-03,oba,More than 35 have set renewable energy targets.,2
2015-08-03,oba,"Over 1,000 mayors have signed an agreement to cut carbon pollution in their cities.",5
2015-08-03,oba,"And last week, 13 of our biggest companies, including UPS and Walmart and GM, made bold, new commitments to cut their emissions and deploy more clean energy.",7
2015-08-03,oba,So the idea of setting standards and cutting carbon pollution is not new.,6
2015-08-03,oba,It's not radical.,1
2015-08-03,oba,"What is new is that, starting today, Washington is starting to catch up with the vision of the rest of the country.",9
2015-08-03,oba,"And by setting these standards, we can actually speed up our transition to a cleaner, safer future.",4
2015-08-03,oba,"With this Clean Power Plan, by 2030, carbon pollution from our power plants will be 32 percent lower than it was a decade ago.",4
2015-08-03,oba,And the nerdier way to say that is that we’ll be keeping 870 million tons of carbon dioxide pollution out of our atmosphere.,8
2015-08-03,oba,"The simpler, layman’s way of saying that is it’s like cutting every ounce of emission due to electricity from 108 million American homes.",10
2015-08-03,oba,Or it's the equivalent of taking 166 million cars off the road.,6
2015-08-03,oba,"By 2030, we will reduce premature deaths from power plant emissions by nearly 90 percent -- and thanks to this plan, there will be 90,000 fewer asthma attacks among our children each year.",6
2015-08-03,oba,"And by combining this with greater investment in our booming clean energy sector, and smarter investments in energy efficiency, and by working with the world to achieve a climate agreement by the end of this year, we can do more to slow, and maybe even eventually stop, the carbon pollution that’s doing so much harm to our climate.",8
2015-08-03,oba,So this is the right thing to do.,3
2015-08-03,oba,"I want to thank, again, Gina and her team for doing it the right way.",5
2015-08-03,oba,"Over the longest engagement process in EPA history, they fielded more than 4 million public comments; they worked with states, they worked with power companies, and environmental groups, and faith groups, and people across our country to make sure that what we were doing was realistic and achievable, but still ambitious.",8
2015-08-03,oba,And some of those people are with us here today.,4
2015-08-03,oba,"So, Tanya Brown -- Tanya, wave, go ahead -- there’s Tanya.",4
2015-08-03,oba,"Tanya Brown has joined up with moms across America to spread the word about the dangers climate change pose to the health of our children -- including Tanya’s daughter, Sanaa.",10
2015-08-03,oba,"There’s Sanaa, right there.",2
2015-08-03,oba,"Dr. Sumita Khatri has spent her career researching the health impacts of pollution at the Cleveland Clinic, and helping families whose lives are impacted every single day.",5
2015-08-03,oba,"Doctor, thank you.",1
2015-08-03,oba,Sister Joan Marie Steadman has helped rally Catholic women across America to take on climate.,3
2015-08-03,oba,"Sister, thank you so much for your leadership.",3
2015-08-03,oba,"And she’s got a pretty important guy on her side -- as Pope Francis made clear in his encyclical this summer, taking a stand against climate change is a moral obligation.",5
2015-08-03,oba,And Sister Steadman is living up to that obligation every single day.,3
2015-08-03,oba,"Now, let’s be clear.",2
2015-08-03,oba,There will be critics of what we’re trying to do.,5
2015-08-03,oba,There will be cynics that say it cannot be done.,4
2015-08-03,oba,"Long before the details of this Clean Power Plan were even decided, the special interests and their allies in Congress were already mobilizing to oppose it with everything they’ve got.",6
2015-08-03,oba,"They will claim that this plan will cost you money -- even though this plan, the analysis shows, will ultimately save the average American nearly $85 a year on their energy bills.",5
2015-08-03,oba,"They’ll claim we need to slash our investments in clean energy, it's a waste of money -- even though they’re happy to spend billions of dollars a year in subsidizing oil companies.",7
2015-08-03,oba,"They’ll claim this plan will kill jobs -- even though our transition to a cleaner energy economy has the solar industry, to just name one example, creating jobs 10 times faster than the rest of the economy.",10
2015-08-03,oba,"They’ll claim this plan is a “war on coal,” to scare up votes -- even as they ignore my plan to actually invest in revitalizing coal country, and supporting health care and retirement for coal miners and their families, and retraining those workers for better-paying jobs and healthier jobs.",10
2015-08-03,oba,Communities across America have been losing coal jobs for decades.,3
2015-08-03,oba,"I want to work with Congress to help them, not to use them as a political football.",6
2015-08-03,oba,Partisan press releases aren’t going to help those families.,3
2015-08-03,oba,"Even more cynical, we've got critics of this plan who are actually claiming that this will harm minority and low-income communities -- even though climate change hurts those Americans the most, who are the most vulnerable.",9
2015-08-03,oba,"Today, an African-American child is more than twice as likely to be hospitalized from asthma; a Latino child is 40 percent more likely to die from asthma.",5
2015-08-03,oba,"So if you care about low-income, minority communities, start protecting the air that they breathe, and stop trying to rob them of their health care.",8
2015-08-03,oba,"You could also expand Medicaid in your states, by the way.",3
2015-08-03,oba,Here’s the thing.,2
2015-08-03,oba,We've heard these same stale arguments before.,2
2015-08-03,oba,"Every time America has made progress, it's been despite these kind of claims.",4
2015-08-03,oba,"Whenever America has set clear rules and smarter standards for our air, our water, our children’s health, we get the same scary stories about killing jobs and businesses and freedom.",7
2015-08-03,oba,It's true.,1
2015-08-03,oba,I'm going to go off script here just for a second.,4
2015-08-03,oba,Because this is important -- because sometimes I think we feel as if there’s nothing we can do.,6
2015-08-03,oba,"Tomorrow is my birthday, so I'm starting to reflect on age.",3
2015-08-03,oba,"And in thinking about what we were doing here today, I was reminded about landing in Los Angeles to attend a college as a freshman, as an 18-year-old.",6
2015-08-03,oba,And it was late August.,2
2015-08-03,oba,I was moving from Hawaii.,2
2015-08-03,oba,"And I got to the campus, and I decided -- I had a lot of pent-up energy and I wanted to go take a run.",7
2015-08-03,oba,"And after about five minutes, suddenly I had this weird feeling, I couldn't breathe.",5
2015-08-03,oba,"And the reason was, back in 1979, Los Angeles still was so full of smog that there were days where people who were vulnerable just could not go outside.",7
2015-08-03,oba,And they were fairly frequent.,2
2015-08-03,oba,"And folks who are older than me can remember the Cayuga River burning because of pollution, and acid rain threatening to destroy all the great forests of the Northeast.",6
2015-08-03,oba,"And you fast-forward 30, 40 years later, and we solved those problems.",3
2015-08-03,oba,"But at the time, the same characters who are going to be criticizing this plan were saying, this is going to kill jobs, this is going to destroy businesses, this is going to hurt low-income people, it's going to be wildly expensive.",6
2015-08-03,oba,"And each time, they were wrong.",2
2015-08-03,oba,"And because we pushed through, despite those scaremongering tactics, you can actually run in Los Angeles without choking.",4
2015-08-03,oba,And folks can actually take a boat out on that river.,3
2015-08-03,oba,And those forests are there.,2
2015-08-03,oba,So we got to learn lessons.,2
2015-08-03,oba,We got to know our history.,3
2015-08-03,oba,The kinds of criticisms that you're going to hear are simply excuses for inaction.,4
2015-08-03,oba,They’re not even good business sense.,2
2015-08-03,oba,They underestimate American business and American ingenuity.,3
2015-08-03,oba,"In 1970, when Republican President Richard Nixon decided to do something about the smog that was choking our cities, they warned that the new pollution standards would decimate the auto industry.",10
2015-08-03,oba,It didn’t happen.,1
2015-08-03,oba,Catalytic converters worked.,2
2015-08-03,oba,Taking the lead out of gasoline worked.,4

2015-09-24,oba,I should explain that our backyard is not typically this crowded -- but the size and spirit of today’s gathering is just a small reflection of the deep devotion of some 70 million American Catholics.,8

2015-09-24,oba,"You remind us that in the eyes of God our measure as individuals, and our measure as a society, is not determined by wealth or power or station or celebrity, but by how well we hew to Scripture’s call to lift up the poor and the marginalized -- to stand up for justice and against inequality, and to ensure that every human being is able to live in dignity -- because we are all made in the image of God.",9
2015-09-24,oba,You remind us that “the Lord’s most powerful message” is mercy.,4

2015-09-24,oba,"Here at home and around the world, may our generation heed your call to “never remain on the sidelines of this march of living hope.”

For that great gift of hope, Holy Father, we thank you, and welcome you, with joy and gratitude, to the United States of America.",9
2015-10-02,oba,"There’s been another mass shooting in America -- this time, in a community college in Oregon.",4
2015-10-02,oba,"That means there are more American families -- moms, dads, children -- whose lives have been changed forever.",5
2015-10-02,oba,"That means there’s another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children.",6
2015-10-02,oba,"I’ve been to Roseburg, Oregon.",3
2015-10-02,oba,There are really good people there.,2
2015-10-02,oba,I want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today.,5
2015-10-02,oba,"Federal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role, and we’ve offered to stay and help as much as Roseburg needs, for as long as they need.",6
2015-10-02,oba,"In the coming days, we’ll learn about the victims -- young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives.",8
2015-10-02,oba,And America will wrap everyone who’s grieving with our prayers and our love.,6
2015-10-02,oba,"But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough.",9
2015-10-02,oba,It’s not enough.,1
2015-10-02,oba,It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel.,3
2015-10-02,oba,"And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America -- next week, or a couple of months from now.",7
2015-10-02,oba,We don't yet know why this individual did what he did.,3
2015-10-02,oba,"And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations may be.",8
2015-10-02,oba,But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people.,7
2015-10-02,oba,We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.,6
2015-10-02,oba,"Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, “The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws -- even in the face of repeated mass killings.”  And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana.",8
2015-10-02,oba,That day!,1
2015-10-02,oba,Somehow this has become routine.,1
2015-10-02,oba,The reporting is routine.,2
2015-10-02,oba,My response here at this podium ends up being routine.,4
2015-10-02,oba,The conversation in the aftermath of it.,4
2015-10-02,oba,We've become numb to this.,3
2015-10-02,oba,"We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston.",3
2015-10-02,oba,It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.,8
2015-10-02,oba,"And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation.",9
2015-10-02,oba,"Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out:  We need more guns, they’ll argue.",4
2015-10-02,oba,Fewer gun safety laws.,2
2015-10-02,oba,Does anybody really believe that?,1
2015-10-02,oba,There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country -- they know that's not true.,7
2015-10-02,oba,"We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws -- including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.",12
2015-10-02,oba,"There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America.",5
2015-10-02,oba,"So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer?",4
2015-10-02,oba,We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.,5
2015-10-02,oba,"So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence.",8
2015-10-02,oba,"We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings.",7
2015-10-02,oba,"Friends of ours, allies of ours -- Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours.",4
2015-10-02,oba,So we know there are ways to prevent it.,4
2015-10-02,oba,"And, of course, what’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.",4
2015-10-02,oba,"Well, this is something we should politicize.",3
2015-10-02,oba,"It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.",4
2015-10-02,oba,"I would ask news organizations -- because I won't put these facts forward -- have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who’ve been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.",8
2015-10-02,oba,This won't be information coming from me; it will be coming from you.,5
2015-10-02,oba,"We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so.",8
2015-10-02,oba,"And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths.",9
2015-10-02,oba,How can that be?,1
2015-10-02,oba,This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America.,7
2015-10-02,oba,We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.,7
2015-10-02,oba,"When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer.",4
2015-10-02,oba,"When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer.",4
2015-10-02,oba,"When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce auto fatalities.",3
2015-10-02,oba,We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives.,3
2015-10-02,oba,"So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations doesn’t make sense.",12
2015-10-02,oba,"So, tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up.",8
2015-10-02,oba,And that will require a change of politics on this issue.,4
2015-10-02,oba,"And it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision.",11
2015-10-02,oba,"If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.",4
2015-10-02,oba,"And I would particularly ask America’s gun owners -- who are using those guns properly, safely, to hunt, for sport, for protecting their families -- to think about whether your views are properly being represented by the organization that suggests it's speaking for you.",9
2015-10-02,oba,And each time this happens I'm going to bring this up.,3
2015-10-02,oba,"Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws.",6
2015-10-02,oba,And this is not something I can do by myself.,4
2015-10-02,oba,I've got to have a Congress and I've got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this.,8
2015-10-02,oba,I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances.,7
2015-10-02,oba,"But based on my experience as President, I can't guarantee that.",5
2015-10-02,oba,And that's terrible to say.,3
2015-10-02,oba,And it can change.,1
2015-10-02,oba,May God bless the memories of those who were killed today.,5
2015-10-02,oba,"May He bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back.",4
2015-10-02,oba,And may He give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change.,6
2015-10-02,oba,Thank you.,1
2015-11-14,oba,"Good evening, everybody.",1
2015-11-14,oba,I just want to make a few brief comments about the attacks across Paris tonight.,6
2015-11-14,oba,"Once again, we’ve seen an outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians.",4
2015-11-14,oba,"This is an attack not just on Paris, it’s an attack not just on the people of France, but this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share.",7
2015-11-14,oba,We stand prepared and ready to provide whatever assistance that the government and the people of France need to respond.,9
2015-11-14,oba,France is our oldest ally.,2
2015-11-14,oba,The French people have stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States time and again.,6
2015-11-14,oba,And we want to be very clear that we stand together with them in the fight against terrorism and extremism.,7
2015-11-14,oba,Paris itself represents the timeless values of human progress.,4
2015-11-14,oba,Those who think that they can terrorize the people of France or the values that they stand for are wrong.,8
2015-11-14,oba,"The American people draw strength from the French people’s commitment to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.",7
2015-11-14,oba,"We are reminded in this time of tragedy that the bonds of liberté and égalité and fraternité are not only values that the French people care so deeply about, but they are values that we share.",5
2015-11-14,oba,And those values are going to endure far beyond any act of terrorism or the hateful vision of those who perpetrated the crimes this evening.,9
2015-11-14,oba,"We’re going to do whatever it takes to work with the French people and with nations around the world to bring these terrorists to justice, and to go after any terrorist networks that go after our people.",11
2015-11-14,oba,We don’t yet know all the details of what has happened.,4
2015-11-14,oba,"We have been in contact with French officials to communicate our deepest condolences to the families of those who have been killed, to offer our prayers and thoughts to those who have been wounded.",7
2015-11-14,oba,We have offered our full support to them.,2
2015-11-14,oba,The situation is still unfolding.,2
2015-11-14,oba,"I’ve chosen not to call President Hollande at this time, because my expectation is that he’s very busy at the moment.",5
2015-11-14,oba,"I actually, by coincidence, was talking to him earlier today in preparation for the G20 meeting.",5
2015-11-14,oba,"But I am confident that I’ll be in direct communications with him in the next few days, and we’ll be coordinating in any ways that they think are helpful in the investigation of what’s happened.",11
2015-11-14,oba,This is a heartbreaking situation.,2
2015-11-14,oba,And obviously those of us here in the United States know what it’s like.,5
2015-11-14,oba,We’ve gone through these kinds of episodes ourselves.,4
2015-11-14,oba,"And whenever these kinds of attacks happened, we’ve always been able to count on the French people to stand with us.",5
2015-11-14,oba,"They have been an extraordinary counterterrorism partner, and we intend to be there with them in that same fashion.",5
2015-11-14,oba,"I’m sure that in the days ahead we’ll learn more about exactly what happened, and my teams will make sure that we are in communication with the press to provide you accurate information.",8
2015-11-14,oba,I don’t want to speculate at this point in terms of who was responsible for this.,8
2015-11-14,oba,It appears that there may still be live activity and dangers that are taking place as we speak.,6
2015-11-14,oba,"And so until we know from French officials that the situation is under control, and we have for more information about it, I don’t want to speculate.",6
2015-11-14,oba,Okay?,1
2015-11-14,oba,Thank you very much.,2

2015-12-14,oba,"Instead, we’ve seen the longest streak of private-sector job creation in our history.",5
2015-12-14,oba,We’ve driven our economic output to all-time highs while driving our carbon pollution down to its lowest level in nearly two decades.,8
2015-12-14,oba,"And then, with our historic joint announcement with China last year, we showed it was possible to bridge the old divides between developed and developing nations that had stymied global progress for so long.",9
2015-12-14,oba,That accomplishment encouraged dozens and dozens of other nations to set their own ambitious climate targets.,5
2015-12-14,oba,And that was the foundation for success in Paris.,3
2015-12-14,oba,"Because no nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this challenge alone.",5
2015-12-14,oba,"And no country, no matter how small, can sit on the sidelines.",3
2015-12-14,oba,All of us had to solve it together.,3
2015-12-14,oba,"Now, no agreement is perfect, including this one.",3
2015-12-14,oba,Negotiations that involve nearly 200 nations are always challenging.,5
2015-12-14,oba,"Even if all the initial targets set in Paris are met, we’ll only be part of the way there when it comes to reducing carbon from the atmosphere.",9
2015-12-14,oba,So we cannot be complacent because of today’s agreement.,5
2015-12-14,oba,The problem is not solved because of this accord.,3
2015-12-14,oba,"But make no mistake, the Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis.",5
2015-12-14,oba,"It creates the mechanism, the architecture, for us to continually tackle this problem in an effective way.",6
2015-12-14,oba,"This agreement is ambitious, with every nation setting and committing to their own specific targets, even as we take into account differences among nations.",7
2015-12-14,oba,"We’ll have a strong system of transparency, including periodic reviews and independent assessments, to help hold every country accountable for meeting its commitments.",7
2015-12-14,oba,"As technology advances, this agreement allows progress to pave the way for even more ambitious targets over time.",8
2015-12-14,oba,And we have secured a broader commitment to support the most vulnerable countries as they pursue cleaner economic growth.,5
2015-12-14,oba,"In short, this agreement will mean less of the carbon pollution that threatens our planet, and more of the jobs and economic growth driven by low-carbon investment.",9
2015-12-14,oba,"Full implementation of this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change, and will pave the way for even more progress, in successive stages, over the coming years.",8
2015-12-14,oba,"Moreover, this agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is firmly committed to a low-carbon future.",7
2015-12-14,oba,And that has the potential to unleash investment and innovation in clean energy at a scale we have never seen before.,6
2015-12-14,oba,The targets we’ve set are bold.,3
2015-12-14,oba,"And by empowering businesses, scientists, engineers, workers, and the private sector -- investors -- to work together, this agreement represents the best chance we’ve had to save the one planet that we’ve got.",8
2015-12-14,oba,So I believe this moment can be a turning point for the world.,5
2015-12-14,oba,We’ve shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge.,6
2015-12-14,oba,It won’t be easy.,1
2015-12-14,oba,Progress won’t always come quick.,1
2015-12-14,oba,We cannot be complacent.,1
2015-12-14,oba,While our generation will see some of the benefits of building a clean energy economy -- jobs created and money saved -- we may not live to see the full realization of our achievement.,8
2015-12-14,oba,But that’s okay.,1
2015-12-14,oba,What matters is that today we can be more confident that this planet is going to be in better shape for the next generation.,7
2015-12-14,oba,And that’s what I care about.,3
2015-12-14,oba,"I imagine taking my grandkids, if I’m lucky enough to have some, to the park someday, and holding their hands, and hearing their laughter, and watching a quiet sunset, all the while knowing that our work today prevented an alternate future that could have been grim; that our work, here and now, gave future generations cleaner air, and cleaner water, and a more sustainable planet.",8
2015-12-14,oba,And what could be more important than that?,3
2015-12-14,oba,"Today, thanks to strong, principled, American leadership, that’s the world that we’ll leave to our children -- a world that is safer and more secure, more prosperous, and more free.",9
2015-12-14,oba,And that is our most important mission in our short time here on this Earth.,4
2015-12-14,oba,Thanks.,1
2016-01-13,oba," Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:

Tonight marks the eighth year that I’ve come here to report on the State of the Union.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"And for this final one, I’m going to try to make it shorter.",4
2016-01-13,oba,I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.,6
2016-01-13,oba,(I've been there.,1
2016-01-13,oba,I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips.),3
2016-01-13,oba,"Now, I understand that because it’s an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low.",6
2016-01-13,oba,"But Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.",8
2016-01-13,oba,"So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities -- like criminal justice reform, and helping -- and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse.",11
2016-01-13,oba,"So, who knows, we might just surprise the cynics again.",2
2016-01-13,oba,"But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead.",8
2016-01-13,oba,"Don’t worry, I’ve got plenty -- from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients.",9
2016-01-13,oba,And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration system; protecting our kids from gun violence; equal pay for equal work; paid leave; raising the minimum wage.,11
2016-01-13,oba,All these things -- All these things still matter to hardworking families.,4
2016-01-13,oba,"They’re still the right thing to do, and I won’t let up until they get done.",3
2016-01-13,oba,"But for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to just talk about next year.",5
2016-01-13,oba,"I want to focus on the next five years, the next ten years, and beyond.",4
2016-01-13,oba,I want to focus on our future.,4
2016-01-13,oba,"We live in a time of extraordinary change -- change that’s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world.",7
2016-01-13,oba,"It’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families.",4
2016-01-13,oba,It promises education for girls in the most remote villages but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away.,7
2016-01-13,oba,It’s change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality.,4
2016-01-13,oba,"And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"America's been through big changes before -- wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights.",6
2016-01-13,oba,"Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future, who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control.",14
2016-01-13,oba,And each time we overcame those fears.,2
2016-01-13,oba,"We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to ""the dogmas of the quiet past.""",5
2016-01-13,oba,Instead we thought anew and acted anew.,2
2016-01-13,oba,"We made change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward -- to the next frontier, to more people.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"And because we did, because we saw opportunity where there -- where others others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before.",7
2016-01-13,oba,What was true then can be true now.,2
2016-01-13,oba,"Our unique strengths as a nation, our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law -- these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.",10
2016-01-13,oba,"In fact, it’s in that spirit that we have made the progress these past seven years.",3
2016-01-13,oba,That’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.,4
2016-01-13,oba,That’s how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector.,4
2016-01-13,oba,That’s how -- That’s how we -- That’s how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans.,4
2016-01-13,oba,That’s how we -- That’s -- That’s how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.,4
2016-01-13,oba,But -- But such progress is not inevitable.,2
2016-01-13,oba,It’s the result of choices we make together.,5
2016-01-13,oba,And we face such choices right now.,2
2016-01-13,oba,"Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear -- turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people?",7
2016-01-13,oba,"Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, and the incredible things that we can do together?",6
2016-01-13,oba,"So let’s talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.",8
2016-01-13,oba,"First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?",6
2016-01-13,oba,"Second, how do we make technology work for us and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?",7
2016-01-13,oba,"Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?",5
2016-01-13,oba,"And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us, and not what’s worst?",4
2016-01-13,oba,"Let me start with the economy and a basic fact: The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world.",6
2016-01-13,oba,"We’re in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history -- more than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half.",8
2016-01-13,oba,Our auto industry just had its best year ever.,2
2016-01-13,oba,"That’s just part of a manufacturing surge that’s created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years.",7
2016-01-13,oba,And we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.,5
2016-01-13,oba,Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.,6
2016-01-13,oba,"Now -- What is true, and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious, is that the economy has been changing in profound ways -- changes that started long before the Great Recession hit, changes that have not let up.",8
2016-01-13,oba,"Today, technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated.",4
2016-01-13,oba,Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition.,4
2016-01-13,oba,"As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise.",4
2016-01-13,oba,Companies have less loyalty to their communities.,4
2016-01-13,oba,And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.,3
2016-01-13,oba,"All these trends have squeezed workers -- even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"It’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to.",6
2016-01-13,oba,"And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.",5
2016-01-13,oba,"For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"We’ve made progress, but we need to make more.",3
2016-01-13,oba,"And despite all the political arguments that we’ve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.",5
2016-01-13,oba,We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job.,8
2016-01-13,oba,The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start.,4
2016-01-13,oba,"And together we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering.",7
2016-01-13,oba,"In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and offering every student -- offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one.",9
2016-01-13,oba,We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.,4
2016-01-13,oba,And -- And we have to make college affordable for every American.,5
2016-01-13,oba,No hardworking student should be stuck in the red.,3
2016-01-13,oba,"We’ve already reduced student loan payments by -- to 10 percent of a borrower’s income, and that’s good.",6
2016-01-13,oba,But now we’ve actually got to cut the cost of college.,4
2016-01-13,oba,"Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I’m going to keep fighting to get that started this year.",6
2016-01-13,oba,It’s the right thing to do.,3
2016-01-13,oba,But a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy.,5
2016-01-13,oba,We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security.,5
2016-01-13,oba,It’s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and a retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber.,15
2016-01-13,oba,"For everyone else, especially folks in their 40s and 50s, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.",7
2016-01-13,oba,"Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool; they may have to retrain; but they shouldn’t loose what they’ve already worked so hard to build in the process.",7
2016-01-13,oba,That’s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever.,4
2016-01-13,oba,"We shouldn’t weaken them, we should strengthen them.",2
2016-01-13,oba,"And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.",5
2016-01-13,oba,"That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"It’s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business you’ll still have coverage.",7
2016-01-13,oba,"Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far, and in the process -- in the process health care inflation has slowed, our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.",5
2016-01-13,oba,"Now, I’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon.",4
2016-01-13,oba,But -- (a little applause right there; just a guess) -- But there should be other ways parties can work together improve economic security.,3
2016-01-13,oba,"Say a hardworking American loses his job, we shouldn’t just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance.",4
2016-01-13,oba,We should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him.,9
2016-01-13,oba,"If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"And even if he’s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.",5
2016-01-13,oba,That’s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.,5
2016-01-13,oba,I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty.,6
2016-01-13,oba,"America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up, and I’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support -- like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don’t have children.",8
2016-01-13,oba,"But there are some areas where we just have to be honest: It has been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years, and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.",15
2016-01-13,oba,And it’s an honest disagreement.,2
2016-01-13,oba,And the American people have a choice to make.,3
2016-01-13,oba,I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy.,5
2016-01-13,oba,I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed.,5
2016-01-13,oba,There is red tape that needs to be cut.,4
2016-01-13,oba,(There you go.,1
2016-01-13,oba,Yeah.,1
2016-01-13,oba,See?),1
2016-01-13,oba,"But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else’s expense.",7
2016-01-13,oba,The middle -- Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collect -- collective bargaining to go unanswered.,6
2016-01-13,oba,Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis -- recklessness on Wall Street did.,5
2016-01-13,oba,Immigrants aren’t the principal reason wages haven’t gone up.,3
2016-01-13,oba,Those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.,6
2016-01-13,oba,It’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.,6
2016-01-13,oba,"The point is, I believe, that in this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less.",7
2016-01-13,oba,The rules should work for them.,2
2016-01-13,oba,And I’m not alone in this.,2
2016-01-13,oba,"This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders.",8
2016-01-13,oba,And I want to spread those best practices across America.,3
2016-01-13,oba,That’s part of a brighter future.,4
2016-01-13,oba,"In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.",5
2016-01-13,oba,And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?,6
2016-01-13,oba,"Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there.",3
2016-01-13,oba,We didn’t argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget.,4
2016-01-13,oba,"We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later we were walking on the moon.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA.",3
2016-01-13,oba,America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.,4
2016-01-13,oba,America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.,4
2016-01-13,oba,America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better future.,4
2016-01-13,oba,That’s who we are.,2
2016-01-13,oba,"And over the past seven years, we’ve nurtured that spirit.",3
2016-01-13,oba,"We’ve protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.",6
2016-01-13,oba,We’ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.,5
2016-01-13,oba,But we can do so much more.,3
2016-01-13,oba,"You know, last year Vice President Biden said that, with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they’ve had in over a decade.",7
2016-01-13,oba,"Well, so -- so tonight, I’m announcing a new national effort to get it done.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"And because he’s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I’m putting Joe in charge of mission control.",5
2016-01-13,oba,"For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the families that we can still save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"(What do you think, Joe?",1
2016-01-13,oba,Let’s make it happen.),3
2016-01-13,oba,And medical research is critical.,2
2016-01-13,oba,We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.,5
2016-01-13,oba,"Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.",6
2016-01-13,oba,"You will be pretty lonely because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.",8
2016-01-13,oba,"But -- But even if -- even if the planet wasn’t at stake, even if 2014 wasn’t the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out to be even hotter -- why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?",8
2016-01-13,oba,"Listen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"Here are the results: In fields from Iowa to Texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.",5
2016-01-13,oba,"On rooftops from Arizona to New York solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal, in jobs that pay better than average.",7
2016-01-13,oba,"We’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy -- something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.",6
2016-01-13,oba,"And meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.",6
2016-01-13,oba,Gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad either.,5
2016-01-13,oba,"Now we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources.",5
2016-01-13,oba,"Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.",6
2016-01-13,oba,We do them no favor when we don’t show them where the trends are going.,4
2016-01-13,oba,And that’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.,12
2016-01-13,oba,And that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.,6
2016-01-13,oba,"Now, none of this is going to happen overnight.",3
2016-01-13,oba,"And yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.",7
2016-01-13,oba,"But the jobs we’ll create, the money we’ll save, the planet we’ll preserve -- that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve; and it’s within our grasp.",4
2016-01-13,oba,"Now, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world, and that’s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.",9
2016-01-13,oba,I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air.,6
2016-01-13,oba,Well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.,6
2016-01-13,oba,Let me -- Let me tell you something: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth -- period.,6
2016-01-13,oba,Period.,1
2016-01-13,oba,It’s not even close.,2
2016-01-13,oba,It’s not even close.,2
2016-01-13,oba,It’s not even close.,2
2016-01-13,oba,We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.,4
2016-01-13,oba,Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.,6
2016-01-13,oba,No nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin.,5
2016-01-13,oba,Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office.,7

2016-04-25,oba,"And over the last seven years, I have relied on your friendship and counsel, and your firm moral compass.",3
2016-04-25,oba,"So we very much appreciate your Chancellor, Angela Merkel.",3
2016-04-25,oba,"To the members of the Bundestag, Prime Minister Weil, Mayor Schostock, distinguished guests, people of Germany.",8
2016-04-25,oba,And I’m especially pleased to see the young people here -- from Germany and across Europe.,6
2016-04-25,oba,We also have some proud Americans here.,2
2016-04-25,oba,I have to admit that I have developed a special place in my heart for the German people.,6
2016-04-25,oba,"Back when I was a candidate for this office, you welcomed me with a small rally in Berlin, where I spoke of the change that’s possible when the world stands as one.",11
2016-04-25,oba,"As President, you've treated me and Michelle and our daughters to wonderful hospitality.",4
2016-04-25,oba,You've offered me excellent beer -- and weisswurst in Krun.,4
2016-04-25,oba,You've now hosted our delegation here in Hannover.,3
2016-04-25,oba,My only regret is that I have never been to Germany for Oktoberfest.,3
2016-04-25,oba,So I will have to come back.,2
2016-04-25,oba,And I suspect it's more fun when you're not President.,3
2016-04-25,oba,So my timing will be good.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"And as always, I bring the friendship of the American people.",4
2016-04-25,oba,"We consider the German people, and all of our European allies, to be among our closest friends in the world -- because we share so much experience and so many of the same values.",7
2016-04-25,oba,We believe that nations and peoples should live in security and peace.,4
2016-04-25,oba,We believe in creating opportunity that lifts up not just the few but the many.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"And I’m proud to be the first American President to come to Europe and be able to say that, in the United States, health care is not a privilege, it is now a right for all.",11
2016-04-25,oba,We share that as well.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"Perhaps most importantly, we believe in the equality and inherent dignity of every human being.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"Today in America, people have the freedom to marry the person that they love.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"We believe in justice, that no child in the world should ever die from a mosquito bite; that no one should suffer from the ache of an empty stomach; that, together, we can save our planet and the world’s most vulnerable people from the worst effects of climate change.",7
2016-04-25,oba,These are things that we share.,3
2016-04-25,oba,It's borne of common experience.,3
2016-04-25,oba,"And this is what I want to talk to you about today -- the future that we are building together -- not separately, but together.",5
2016-04-25,oba,And that starts right here in Europe.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"And I want to begin with an observation that, given the challenges that we face in the world and the headlines we see every day, may seem improbable, but it’s true.",10
2016-04-25,oba,"We are fortunate to be living in the most peaceful, most prosperous, most progressive era in human history.",7
2016-04-25,oba,That may surprise young people who are watching TV or looking at your phones and it seems like only bad news comes through every day.,6
2016-04-25,oba,But consider that it’s been decades since the last war between major powers.,7
2016-04-25,oba,More people live in democracies.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"We’re wealthier and healthier and better educated, with a global economy that has lifted up more than a billion people from extreme poverty, and created new middle classes from the Americas to Africa to Asia.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"Think about the health of the average person in the world -- tens of millions of lives that we now save from disease and infant mortality, and people now living longer lives.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"Around the world, we’re more tolerant -- with more opportunity for women, and gays and lesbians, as we push back on bigotry and prejudice.",4
2016-04-25,oba,"And around the world, there’s a new generation of young people -- like you -- that are connected by technology, and driven by your idealism and your imagination, and you're working together to start new ventures, and to hold governments more accountable, and advance human dignity.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"If you had to choose a moment in time to be born, any time in human history, and you didn't know ahead of time what nationality you were or what gender or what your economic status might be, you'd choose today -- which isn't to say that there is not still enormous suffering and enormous tragedy and so much work for us to do.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"It is to remember that the trajectory of our history over the last 50, 100 years has been remarkable.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"And we can't take that for granted, and we should take confidence in our ability to be able to shape our own destiny.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"Now, that doesn't mean that we can be complacent because today dangerous forces do threaten to pull the world backward, and our progress is not inevitable.",5
2016-04-25,oba,These challenges threaten Europe and they threaten our transatlantic community.,3
2016-04-25,oba,We're not immune from the forces of change around the world.,8
2016-04-25,oba,"As they have elsewhere, barbaric terrorists have slaughtered innocent people in Paris and Brussels, and Istanbul and San Bernardino, California.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"And we see these tragedies in places central to our daily lives -- an airport or café, a workplace or a theater -- and it unsettles us.",9
2016-04-25,oba,It makes us unsure in our day-to-day lives -- fearful not just for ourselves but those that we love.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"Conflicts from South Sudan to Syria to Afghanistan have sent millions fleeing, seeking the relative safety of Europe’s shores, but that puts new strains on countries and local communities, and threatens to distort our politics.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"Russian aggression has flagrantly violated the sovereignty and territory of an independent European nation, Ukraine, and that unnerves our allies in Eastern Europe, threatening our vision of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace.",10
2016-04-25,oba,And it seems to threaten the progress that's been made since the end of the Cold War.,8
2016-04-25,oba,"Slow economic growth in Europe, especially in the south, has left millions unemployed, including a generation of young people without jobs and who may look to the future with diminishing hopes.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"And all these persistent challenges have led some to question whether European integration can long endure; whether you might be better off separating off, redrawing some of the barriers and the laws between nations that existed in the 20th century.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"Across our countries, including in the United States, a lot of workers and families are still struggling to recover from the worst economic crisis in generations.",4
2016-04-25,oba,And that trauma of millions who lost their jobs and their homes and their savings is still felt.,8
2016-04-25,oba,"And meanwhile, there are profound trends underway that have been going on for decades -- globalization, automation that -- in some cases, of depressed wages, and made workers in a weaker position to bargain for better working conditions.",15
2016-04-25,oba,Wages have stagnated in many advanced countries while other costs have gone up.,3
2016-04-25,oba,Inequality has increased.,1
2016-04-25,oba,"And for many people, it’s harder than ever just to hold on.",4
2016-04-25,oba,This is happening in Europe; we see some of these trends in the United States and across the advanced economies.,7
2016-04-25,oba,And these concerns and anxieties are real.,2
2016-04-25,oba,They are legitimate.,1
2016-04-25,oba,"They cannot be ignored, and they deserve solutions from those in power.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"Unfortunately, in the vacuum, if we do not solve these problems, you start seeing those who would try to exploit these fears and frustrations and channel them in a destructive way.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"A creeping emergence of the kind of politics that the European project was founded to reject -- an “us” versus “them” mentality that tries to blame our problems on the other, somebody who doesn’t look like us or doesn’t pray like us -- whether it’s immigrants, or Muslims, or somebody who is deemed different than us.",11
2016-04-25,oba,And you see increasing intolerance in our politics.,4
2016-04-25,oba,And loud voices get the most attention.,2
2016-04-25,oba,This reminds me of the poem by the great Irish poet W.B.,3
2016-04-25,oba,"Yeats, where the best lack all conviction, and the worst are full of passionate intensity.",4
2016-04-25,oba,So this is a defining moment.,2
2016-04-25,oba,And what happens on this continent has consequences for people around the globe.,6
2016-04-25,oba,"If a unified, peaceful, liberal, pluralistic, free-market Europe begins to doubt itself, begins to question the progress that’s been made over the last several decades, then we can’t expect the progress that is just now taking hold in many places around the world will continue.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"Instead, we will be empowering those who argue that democracy can’t work, that intolerance and tribalism and organizing ourselves along ethnic lines, and authoritarianism and restrictions on the press -- that those are the things that the challenges of today demand.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"So I’ve come here today, to the heart of Europe, to say that the United States, and the entire world, needs a strong and prosperous and democratic and united Europe.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"Perhaps you need an outsider, somebody who is not European, to remind you of the magnitude of what you have achieved.",6
2016-04-25,oba,The progress that I described was made possible in large measure by ideals that originated on this continent in a great Enlightenment and the founding of new republics.,9
2016-04-25,oba,"Of course, that progress didn’t travel a straight line.",2
2016-04-25,oba,In the last century -- twice in just 30 years -- the forces of empire and intolerance and extreme nationalism consumed this continent.,6
2016-04-25,oba,And cities like this one were largely reduced to rubble.,4
2016-04-25,oba,Tens of millions of men and women and children were killed.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"But from the ruins of the Second World War, our nations set out to remake the world -- to build a new international order and the institutions to uphold it.",5
2016-04-25,oba,A United Nations to prevent another world war and advance a more just and lasting peace.,4
2016-04-25,oba,International financial institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to promote prosperity for all peoples.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"A Universal Declaration of Human Rights to advance the “inalienable rights of all members of the human family.”  And here in Europe, giants like Chancellor Adenauer set out to bind old adversaries through commerce and through trade.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"As Adenauer said in those early days, “European unity was a dream of a few.",4
2016-04-25,oba,It became a hope for many.,3
2016-04-25,oba,"Today it is a necessity for all of us.”

And it wasn’t easy.",5
2016-04-25,oba,Old animosities had to be overcome.,2
2016-04-25,oba,National pride had to be joined with a commitment to a common good.,6
2016-04-25,oba,Complex questions of sovereignty and burden-sharing had to be answered.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"Ant at every step, the impulse to pull back -- for each country to go its own way -- had to be resisted.",4
2016-04-25,oba,"More than once, skeptics predicted the demise of this great project.",4
2016-04-25,oba,"But the vision of European unity soldiered on -- and having defended Europe’s freedom in war, America stood with you every step of this journey.",5
2016-04-25,oba,A Marshall Plan to rebuild; an airlift to save Berlin; a NATO alliance to defend our way of life.,6
2016-04-25,oba,"America’s commitment to Europe was captured by a young American President, John F. Kennedy, when he stood in a free West Berlin and declared that “freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free.”

With strength and resolve and the power of our ideals, and a belief in a unified Europe, we didn’t simply end the Cold War -- freedom won.",9
2016-04-25,oba,Germany was reunited.,1
2016-04-25,oba,"You welcomed new democracies into an even “ever closer union.”  You may argue over whose football clubs are better, vote for different singers on Eurovision.",4
2016-04-25,oba,"But your accomplishment -- more than 500 million people speaking 24 languages in 28 countries, 19 with a common currency, in one European Union -- remains one of the greatest political and economic achievements of modern times.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"Yes, European unity can require frustrating compromise.",2
2016-04-25,oba,It adds layers of government that can slow decision-making.,4
2016-04-25,oba,I understand.,1
2016-04-25,oba,I've been in meetings with the European Commission.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"And, as an American, we're famously disdainful of government.",3
2016-04-25,oba,We understand how easy it must be to vent at Brussels and complain.,4
2016-04-25,oba,But remember that every member of your union is a democracy.,5
2016-04-25,oba,That's not an accident.,2
2016-04-25,oba,Remember that no EU country has raised arms against another.,3
2016-04-25,oba,That's not an accident.,2
2016-04-25,oba,Remember that NATO is as strong as it’s ever been.,4
2016-04-25,oba,Remember that our market economies -- as Angela and I saw this morning -- are the greatest generators of innovation and wealth and opportunity in history.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"Our freedom, our quality of life remains the envy of the world, so much so that parents are willing to walk across deserts, and cross the seas on makeshift rafts, and risk everything in the hope of giving their children the blessings that we -- that you -- enjoy -- blessings that you cannot take for granted.",12
2016-04-25,oba,"This continent, in the 20th century, was at constant war.",3
2016-04-25,oba,People starved on this continent.,3
2016-04-25,oba,Families were separated on this continent.,3
2016-04-25,oba,And now people desperately want to come here precisely because of what you've created.,4
2016-04-25,oba,You can't take that for granted.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"And today, more than ever, a strong, united Europe remains, as Adenauer said, a necessity for all of us.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"It’s a necessity for the United States, because Europe’s security and prosperity is inherently indivisible from our own.",5
2016-04-25,oba,We can’t cut ourselves off from you.,2
2016-04-25,oba,Our economies are integrated.,2
2016-04-25,oba,Our cultures are integrated.,2
2016-04-25,oba,Our peoples are integrated.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"You saw the response of the American people to Paris and Brussels -- it’s because, in our imaginations, this is our cities.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"A strong, united Europe is a necessity for the world because an integrated Europe remains vital to our international order.",5
2016-04-25,oba,Europe helps to uphold the norms and rules that can maintain peace and promote prosperity around the world.,8
2016-04-25,oba,Consider what we’ve done in recent years:  Pulling the global economy back from the brink of depression and putting the world on the path of recovery.,4
2016-04-25,oba,A comprehensive deal that's cut off every single one of Iran’s paths to a nuclear bomb -- part of our shared vision of a world without nuclear weapons.,6
2016-04-25,oba,"In Paris, the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change.",3
2016-04-25,oba,Stopping Ebola in West Africa and saving countless lives.,3
2016-04-25,oba,"Rallying the world around new sustainable development, including our goal to end extreme poverty.",7
2016-04-25,oba,None of those things could have happened if I -- if the United States did not have a partnership with a strong and united Europe.,6
2016-04-25,oba,It wouldn’t have happened.,1
2016-04-25,oba,That’s what’s possible when Europe and America and the world stand as one.,6
2016-04-25,oba,And that’s precisely what we're going to need to face down the very real dangers that we face today.,6
2016-04-25,oba,So let me just lay out the kind of cooperation that we're going to need.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"We need a strong Europe to bear its share of the burden, working with us on behalf of our collective security.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"The United States has an extraordinary military, the best the world has ever known, but the nature of today’s threats means we can’t deal with these challenges by ourselves.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"Right now, the most urgent threat to our nations is ISIL, and that’s why we’re united in our determination to destroy it.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"And all 28 NATO allies are contributing to our coalition -- whether it’s striking ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq, or supporting the air campaign, or training local forces in Iraq, or providing critical humanitarian aid.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"And we continue to make progress, pushing ISIL back from territory that it controlled.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"And just as I’ve approved additional support for Iraqi forces against ISIL, I’ve decided to increase U.S. support for local forces fighting ISIL in Syria.",8
2016-04-25,oba,A small number of American Special Operations Forces are already on the ground in Syria and their expertise has been critical as local forces have driven ISIL out of key areas.,6
2016-04-25,oba,"So given the success, I’ve approved the deployment of up 250 additional U.S. personnel in Syria, including Special Forces, to keep up this momentum.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"They’re not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces that continue to drive ISIL back.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"So, make no mistake.",2
2016-04-25,oba,"These terrorists will learn the same lesson as others before them have, which is, your hatred is no match for our nations united in the defense of our way of life.",11
2016-04-25,oba,"And just as we remain relentless on the military front, we’re not going to give up on diplomacy to end the civil war in Syria, because the suffering of the Syrian people has to end, and that requires an effective political transition.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"But this remains a difficult fight, and none of us can solve this problem by ourselves.",4
2016-04-25,oba,"Even as European countries make important contributions against ISIL, Europe, including NATO, can still do more.",6
2016-04-25,oba,So I’ve spoken to Chancellor Merkel and I’ll be meeting later with the Presidents of France and the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and of Italy.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"In Syria and Iraq, we need more nations contributing to the air campaign.",5
2016-04-25,oba,We need more nations contributing trainers to help build up local forces in Iraq.,7
2016-04-25,oba,We need more nations to contribute economic assistance to Iraq so it can stabilize liberated areas and break the cycle of violent extremism so that ISIL cannot come back.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"These terrorists are doing everything in their power to strike our cities and kill our citizens, so we need to do everything in our power to stop them.",7
2016-04-25,oba,And that includes closing gaps so terrorists can’t pull off attacks like those in Paris and Brussels.,7
2016-04-25,oba,Which brings me to one other point.,3
2016-04-25,oba,"Europeans, like Americans, cherish your privacy.",3
2016-04-25,oba,"And many are skeptical about governments collecting and sharing information, for good reason.",6
2016-04-25,oba,That skepticism is healthy.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"Germans remember their history of government surveillance -- so do Americans, by the way, particularly those who were fighting on behalf of civil rights.",9
2016-04-25,oba,So it’s part of our democracies to want to make sure our governments are accountable.,6
2016-04-25,oba,But I want to say this to young people who value their privacy and spend a lot of time on their phones:  The threat of terrorism is real.,8
2016-04-25,oba,"In the United States, I’ve worked to reform our surveillance programs to ensure that they’re consistent with the rule of law and upholding our values, like privacy -- and, by the way, we include the privacy of people outside of the United States.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"We care about Europeans’ privacy, not just Americans’ privacy.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"But I also, in working on these issues, have come to recognize security and privacy don’t have to be a contradiction.",5
2016-04-25,oba,We can protect both.,1
2016-04-25,oba,And we have to.,1
2016-04-25,oba,"If we truly value our liberty, then we have to take the steps that are necessary to share information and intelligence within Europe, as well as between the United States and Europe, to stop terrorists from traveling and crossing borders and killing innocent people.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"And as today’s diffuse threats evolve, our alliance has to evolve.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"So we’re going to have a NATO summit this summer in Warsaw, and I will insist that all of us need to meet our responsibilities, united, together.",5
2016-04-25,oba,That means standing with the people of Afghanistan as they build their security forces and push back against violent extremism.,6
2016-04-25,oba,It means more ships in the Aegean to shut down criminal networks who are profiting by smuggling desperate families and children.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"And that said, NATO’s central mission is, and always will be, our solemn duty -- our Article 5 commitment to our common defense.",6
2016-04-25,oba,That’s why we’ll continue to bolster the defense of our frontline allies in Poland and Romania and the Baltic states.,10
2016-04-25,oba,"So we have to both make sure that NATO carries out its traditional mission, but also to meet the threats of NATO’s southern flank.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"That’s why we need to stay nimble, and make sure our forces are interoperable, and invest in new capabilities like cyber defense and missile defense.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"And that’s why every NATO member should be contributing its full share -- 2 percent of GDP -- towards our common security, something that doesn’t always happen.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"And I’ll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense.",4
2016-04-25,oba,"Just as we stand firm in our own defense, we have to uphold our most basic principles of our international order, and that’s a principle that nations like Ukraine have the right to choose their own destiny.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"Remember that it was Ukrainians on the Maidan, many of them your age, reaching out for a future with Europe that prompted Russia to send in its military.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"After all that Europe endured in the 20th century, we must not allow borders to be redrawn by brute force in the 21st century.",5
2016-04-25,oba,So we should keep helping Ukraine with its reforms to improve its economy and consolidate its democracy and modernize its forces to protect its independence.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"And I want good relations with Russia, and have invested a lot in good relations with Russia.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"But we need to keep sanctions on Russia in place until Russia fully implements the Minsk agreements that Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande and others have worked so hard to maintain, and provide a path for a political resolution of this issue.",11
2016-04-25,oba,"And ultimately, it is my fervent hope that Russia recognizes that true greatness comes not from bullying neighbors, but by working with the world, which is the only way to deliver lasting economic growth and progress to the Russian people.",10
2016-04-25,oba,"Now, our collective security rests on a foundation of prosperity, so that brings me to my second point.",4
2016-04-25,oba,"The world needs a prosperous and growing Europe -- not just a strong Europe, but a prosperous and growing Europe that generates good jobs and wages for its people.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"As I mentioned before, the economic anxieties many feel today on both sides of the Atlantic are real.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"The disruptive changes brought about by the global economy, unfortunately, sometimes are hitting certain groups, especially working-class communities, more heavily.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"And if neither the burdens, nor the benefits of our global economy are being fairy distributed, it’s no wonder that people rise up and reject globalization.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"If there are too few winners and too many losers as the global economy integrates, people are going to push back.",7
2016-04-25,oba,So all of us in positions of power have a responsibility as leaders of government and business and civil society to help people realize the promise of economic and security in this integrated economy.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"And the good news is, we know how to do it.",3
2016-04-25,oba,Sometimes we just lack the political will to do it.,3
2016-04-25,oba,"In the United States, our economy is growing again, but the United States can’t be the sole engine of global growth.",5
2016-04-25,oba,And countries should not have to choose between responding to crises and investing in their people.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"So we need to pursue reforms to position us for long-term prosperity, and support demand and invest in the future.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"All of our countries, for example, could be investing more in infrastructure.",4
2016-04-25,oba,All of our countries need to invest in science and research and development that sparks new innovation and new industries.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"All of our countries have to invest in our young people, and make sure that they have the skills and the training and the education they need to adapt to this rapidly changing world.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"All of our countries need to worry about inequality, and make sure that workers are getting a fair share of the incredible productivity that technology and global supply chains are producing.",10
2016-04-25,oba,"But if you’re really concerned about inequality, if you’re really concerned about the plight of workers, if you’re a progressive, it’s my firm belief that you can’t turn inward.",6
2016-04-25,oba,That’s not the right answer.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"We have to keep increasing the trade and investment that supports jobs, as we’re working to do between the United States and the EU.",7
2016-04-25,oba,We need to keep implementing reforms to our banking and financial systems so that the excesses and abuses that triggered the financial crisis never happen again.,6
2016-04-25,oba,"But we can’t do that individually, nation by nation, because finance now is transnational.",3
2016-04-25,oba,It moves around too fast.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"If we’re not coordinating between Europe and the United States and Asia, then it won’t work.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"As the world has been reminded in recent weeks, we need to close loopholes that allow corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes through tax havens and tax avoidance, trillions of dollars that could be going towards pressing needs like education and health care and infrastructure.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"But to do that, we have to work together.",2
2016-04-25,oba,"Here in Europe, as you work to strengthen your union -- including through labor and banking reforms, and by ensuring growth across the Eurozone -- you will have the staunch support of the United States.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"But you’re going to have to do it together, because your economies are too integrated to try to solve these problems on your own.",7
2016-04-25,oba,And I want to repeat:  We have to confront the injustice of widening economic inequality.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"But that is going to require collective work, because capital is mobile, and if only a few countries are worrying about it, then a lot of businesses will head toward places that don’t care about it quite as much.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"For a lot of years, it was thought that countries had to choose between economic growth and economic inclusion.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"Now we know the truth -- when wealth is increasingly concentrated among the few at the top, it’s not only a moral challenge to us but it actually drags down a country’s growth potential.",8
2016-04-25,oba,We need growth that is broad and lifts everybody up.,4
2016-04-25,oba,We need tax policies that do right by working families.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"And those like me who support European unity and free trade also have a profound responsibility to champion strong protections for workers -- a living wage and the right to organize, and a strong safety net, and a commitment to protect consumers and the environment upon which we all depend.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"If we really want to reduce inequality, we've got to make sure everyone who works hard gets a fair shot -- and that's especially true for young people like you -- with education, and job training, and quality health care and good wages.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"And that includes, by the way, making sure that there's equal pay for equal work for women.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"The point is, we have to reform many of our economies.",6
2016-04-25,oba,But the answer to reform is not to start cutting ourselves off from each other.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"Rather, it's to work together.",2
2016-04-25,oba,And this brings me back to where I began.,4
2016-04-25,oba,The world depends upon a democratic Europe that upholds the principles of pluralism and diversity and freedom that are our common creed.,8
2016-04-25,oba,"As free peoples, we cannot allow the forces that I’ve described -- fears about security or economic anxieties -- to undermine our commitment to the universal values that are the source of our strength.",11
2016-04-25,oba,"Democracy, I understand, can be messy.",2
2016-04-25,oba,It can be slow.,1
2016-04-25,oba,It can be frustrating.,1
2016-04-25,oba,I know that.,1
2016-04-25,oba,I have to deal with a Congress.,4
2016-04-25,oba,"We have to constantly work to make sure government is not a collection of distant, detached institutions, but is connected and responsive to the everyday concerns of our people.",7
2016-04-25,oba,There's no doubt that how a united Europe works together can be improved.,5
2016-04-25,oba,But look around the world -- at authoritarian governments and theocracies that rule by fear and oppression -- there is no doubt that democracy is still the most just and effective form of government ever created.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"And when I talk about democracy, I don't just mean elections, because there are a number of countries where people get 70, 80 percent of the vote, but they control all the media and the judiciary.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"And civil society organizations and NGOs can't organize, and have to be registered, and are intimidated.",3
2016-04-25,oba,"I mean real democracy, the sort that we see here in Europe and in the United States.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"So we have to be vigilant in defense of these pillars of democracy -- not just elections, but rule of law, as well as fair elections, a free press, vibrant civil societies where citizens can work for change.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"And we should be suspicious of those who claim to have the interests of Europe at heart and yet don't practice the very values that are essential to Europe, that have made freedom in Europe so real.",11
2016-04-25,oba,"So, yes, these are unsettling times.",2
2016-04-25,oba,"And when the future is uncertain, there seems to be an instinct in our human nature to withdraw to the perceived comfort and security of our own tribe, our own sect, our own nationality, people who look like us, sound like us.",13
2016-04-25,oba,"But in today's world, more than any time in human history, that is a false comfort.",6
2016-04-25,oba,It pits people against one another because of what they look or how they pray or who they love.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"And yet, we know where that kind of twisted thinking can lead.",5
2016-04-25,oba,It can lead to oppression.,2
2016-04-25,oba,It can lead to segregation and internment camps.,4
2016-04-25,oba,And to the Shoah and Srebrenica.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"In the United States, we’ve long wrestled with questions of race and integration, and we do to this day.",5
2016-04-25,oba,And we still have a lot of work to do.,3
2016-04-25,oba,But our progress allows somebody like me to now stand here as President of the United States.,6
2016-04-25,oba,"That's because we committed ourselves to a larger ideal, one based on a creed -- not a race, not a nationality -- a set of principles; truths that we held to be self-evident that all men were created equal.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"And now, as Europe confronts questions of immigration and religion and assimilation, I want you to remember that our countries are stronger, they are more secure and more successful when we welcome and integrate people of all backgrounds and faith, and make them feel as one.",7
2016-04-25,oba,And that includes our fellow citizens who are Muslim.,3
2016-04-25,oba,"Look, the sudden arrival of so many people from beyond our borders, especially when their cultures are very different, that can be daunting.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"We have immigration issues in the United States as well, along our southern border of the United States and from people arriving from all around the world who get a visa and decide they want to stay.",12
2016-04-25,oba,And I know the politics of immigration and refugees is hard.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"It's hard everywhere, in every country.",3
2016-04-25,oba,"And just as a handful of neighborhoods shouldn't bear all the burden of refugee resettlement, neither should any one nation.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"All of us have to step up, all of us have to share this responsibility.",4
2016-04-25,oba,That includes the United States.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"But even as we take steps that are required to ensure our security; even as we help Turkey and Greece cope with this influx in a way that is safe and humane; even as Chancellor Merkel and other European leaders work for an orderly immigration and resettlement process, rather than a disorderly one; even as we all need to collectively do more to invest in the sustainable development and governance in those nations from which people are fleeing so that they can succeed and prosper in their own countries, and so that we can reduce the conflicts that cause so much of the refugee crisis around the world -- Chancellor Merkel and others have eloquently reminded us that we cannot turn our backs on our fellow human beings who are here now, and need our help now.",13
2016-04-25,oba,"We have to uphold our values, not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard.",3
2016-04-25,oba,"In Germany, more than anywhere else, we learned that what the world needs is not more walls.",4
2016-04-25,oba,We can't define ourselves by the barriers we build to keep people out or to keep people in.,6
2016-04-25,oba,"At every crossroads in our history, we've moved forward when we acted on those timeless ideals that tells us to be open to one another, and to respect the dignity of every human being.",9
2016-04-25,oba,"And I think of so many Germans and people across Europe who have welcomed migrants into their homes, because, as one woman in Berlin said, “we needed to do something.”  Just that human impulse to help.",6
2016-04-25,oba,"And I think of the refugee who said, “I want to teach my kids the value of working.”  That human impulse to see the next generation have hope.",8
2016-04-25,oba,"All of us can be guided by the empathy and compassion of His Holiness, Pope Francis, who said “refugees are not numbers, they are people who have faces, names, stories, and need to be treated as such.” 

And I know it may seem easy for me to say all this, living on the other side of the ocean.",7
2016-04-25,oba,And I know that some will call it blind hope when I say that I am confident that the forces that bind Europe together are ultimately much stronger than those trying to pull you apart.,11
2016-04-25,oba,"But hope is not blind when it is rooted in the memory of all that you've already overcome -- your parents, your grandparents.",7
2016-04-25,oba,"So I say to you, the people of Europe, don't forget who you are.",6
2016-04-25,oba,You are the heirs to a struggle for freedom.,4
2016-04-25,oba,"You're the Germans, the French, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Luxembourgers, the Italians -- and yes, the British -- who rose above old divisions and put Europe on the path to union.",7
2016-04-25,oba,You’re the Poles of Solidarity and the Czechs and Slovaks who waged a Velvet Revolution.,5
2016-04-25,oba,"You’re the Latvians, and Lithuanians and Estonians who linked hands in a great human chain of freedom.",6
2016-04-25,oba,You’re the Hungarians and Austrians who cut through borders of barbed wire.,7
2016-04-25,oba,"And you’re the Berliners who, on that November night, finally tore down that wall.",5
2016-04-25,oba,You’re the people of Madrid and London who faced down bombings and refused to give in to fear.,6
2016-04-25,oba,"And you are the Parisians who, later this year, plan to reopen the Bataclan.",5
2016-04-25,oba,"You’re the people of Brussels, in a square of flowers and flags, including one Belgian who offered a message -- we need “more.”  More understanding.",9
2016-04-25,oba,More dialogue.,1
2016-04-25,oba,More humanity.,1
2016-04-25,oba,That's who you are.,2
2016-04-25,oba,"United, together.",1
2016-04-25,oba,"You are Europe -- “United in diversity.”   Guided by the ideals that have lit the world, and stronger when you stand as one.",3

2016-04-25,oba,Because a united Europe -- once the dream of a few -- remains the hope of the many and a necessity for us all.,5
2016-04-25,oba,Thank you very much.,2
2016-04-25,oba,Thank you.,1
2016-05-06,oba,All right.,1
2016-05-06,oba,Let me do some businessing.,3
2016-05-06,oba,Let me begin by recognizing some of the guests who are here.,8
2016-05-06,oba,"Your mayor, Karen Weaver, is here.",3
2016-05-06,oba,I know Governor Rick Snyder is here.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"No, no -- because here's here to -- we're doing some business here.",3
2016-05-06,oba,"Members of Congress are here, including your outstanding senator, Debbie Stabenow.",4
2016-05-06,oba,Flint's own Dan Kildee is here.,3
2016-05-06,oba,Debbie Dingell is here.,2
2016-05-06,oba,Brenda Lawrence is here.,2
2016-05-06,oba,John Conyers is here.,2
2016-05-06,oba,And Sandy Levin.,1
2016-05-06,oba,An outstanding Michigan delegation.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"We've got Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who is the head of Health and Human Services, works for me.",8
2016-05-06,oba,"And Administrator Gina McCarthy is here, as well.",2
2016-05-06,oba,I want to thank Superintendent Bilal Tawwab -- and Principal Tim Green for their hospitality.,6
2016-05-06,oba,And I want to thank all of you for being here.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, not too long ago, I received a letter from a young lady, an eight-year-old girl named Mari Copeny.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"You may know her as ""Little Miss Flint.""",3
2016-05-06,oba,"Those of you who have seats, please feel free to sit down so folks can see behind you.",3
2016-05-06,oba,"If you don't have a seat, don't sit down.",3
2016-05-06,oba,"And like a lot of you, Mari has been worried about what happened here in Flint.",6
2016-05-06,oba,She's worried about what it means for children like her.,7
2016-05-06,oba,She's worried about the future of this city and this community.,7
2016-05-06,oba,"So in the middle of a tragedy that should have never happened here in the United States of America -- the denial of something as basic as clean, safe drinking water -- this eight-year-old girl spoke out and marched and, like many of you, protested.",9
2016-05-06,oba,"As Mari was getting ready to hop on a bus to Washington, she wrote to ask if she could meet with me while she was in town.",6
2016-05-06,oba,There she is.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, I would have been happy to see Mari in Washington.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"But when something like this happens, a young girl shouldn't have to go to Washington to be heard.",4
2016-05-06,oba,I thought her President should come to Flint to meet with her.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"And that's why I'm here -- to tell you directly that I see you and I hear you, and I want to hear directly from you about how this public health crisis has disrupted your lives, how it's made you angry, how it's made you worried.",8
2016-05-06,oba,"And I just had a chance to meet with a few of your neighbors in a roundtable discussion, and I heard from them what I know a lot of you are feeling:  That a lot of you are scared.",7
2016-05-06,oba,That all of you feel let down.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"And I told them that I understood why you'd be afraid -- not just for yourselves, but for your kids.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"I also wanted to come here, though, to tell you that I've got your back -- that we're paying attention.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"So I met and heard directly from those who are leading the federal response and who are working hard to make sure that Flint is whole again, to make sure that this proud city bounces back not just to where it was, but stronger than ever.",13
2016-05-06,oba,And I want all of you to know I am confident that Flint will come back.,5
2016-05-06,oba,"I will not rest, and I'm going to make sure that the leaders, at every level of government, don't rest until every drop of water that flows to your homes is safe to drink and safe to cook with, and safe to bathe in -- because that's part of the basic responsibilities of a government in the United States of America.",13
2016-05-06,oba,"So as President, I've sent Flint the best resources our federal government has to support our state and local partners.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"The agencies that serve you -- the agencies that specialize in health and housing, and those that support small businesses and our kids' education; those that are responsible for the food that our children eat and, of course, the water we drink.",8
2016-05-06,oba,Everybody is on duty.,2
2016-05-06,oba,The National Guard is on duty.,2
2016-05-06,oba,This is a hands-on-deck situation -- all hands on deck.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"Because if there's a child who feels neglected on the north side of Flint, or a family on the east side of this city who wonders whether they should give up on their hometown and move away, or an immigrant who wonders whether America means what we say about being a place where we take care of our own.",15
2016-05-06,oba,"That matters to all of us -- not just in Flint, not just in Michigan, but all across America.",4
2016-05-06,oba,Flint's recovery is everybody's responsibility.,3
2016-05-06,oba,And I'm going to make sure that responsibility is met.,4
2016-05-06,oba,So I just talked with some of the team of responders that are on the ground to make sure that they're coordinating.,11
2016-05-06,oba,And they're doing some incredible things.,2
2016-05-06,oba,They've distributed enough water to fill more than three Olympic-sized swimming pools.,5
2016-05-06,oba,They've distributed thousands of filters.,3
2016-05-06,oba,They're helping students afford nutritious food that work against the contaminants in bad water.,8
2016-05-06,oba,They're making sure new moms have access to instant infant formula that doesn't require water.,7
2016-05-06,oba,"They've expanded health services for children and pregnant women, and education programs for Flint's youngest children.",5
2016-05-06,oba,They're out there testing homes for lead and testing children for exposure to lead.,6
2016-05-06,oba,"But like all our best responses in tough times, this is not a government effort alone.",5
2016-05-06,oba,We need our businesses and nonprofits and philanthropies to step up.,4
2016-05-06,oba,And what's incredible about Flint is how many volunteers have already been leading the way.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"You've got members of one union, UA Local 370, that have donated tens of thousands of dollars and 10,000 hours of their time.",7
2016-05-06,oba,"They've installed thousands of filters, hundreds of faucets by going door to door, night and day.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"They're not asking for anything in return, they're just doing the right thing.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"So many Americans, here in Flint and around the country, have proven that you don't have be a plumber or a pipefitter to pitch in -- although it's very helpful if you're a plumber or pipefitter.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"So, in March, dozens of accountants teamed up with the American Red Cross to help residents recycle all the plastic water bottles that have been piling up.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"Religious and community groups are organizing supply drives, supporting families, offering free medical services.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"The director of a local dance studio, I understand, found a creative way to help; she's letting people use her studio as a space to support one another by sharing their stories and realizing they're not alone.",9
2016-05-06,oba,"Even inmates at an Indiana prison came together to donate more than $2,500 to the people of Flint.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"And a second-grader from Virginia, a young man named Isiah Britt, set up a website to see if he could raise $500 for hand sanitizers to send to the kids at Eisenhower Elementary here in Flint.",8
2016-05-06,oba,"So Isiah, it's fair to say, surpassed his goal, because he raised $15,000.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"And he explained that the experience taught him just because you're small ""doesn't mean you can't do big things.""",5
2016-05-06,oba,"So when you think of all those stories, it should be clear that the American people care about Flint.",4
2016-05-06,oba,The American people are paying attention and they care about you.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"And as is true when disasters strike in other ways, people pitch in, they come together.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"Because they imagine, ""All right, that could have been me.""",3
2016-05-06,oba,That's the good news.,2
2016-05-06,oba,The bad news is that this should not have happened in the first place.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"And even though the scope of the response looks sort of like the efforts we're used to seeing after a natural disaster, that's not what this was.",9
2016-05-06,oba,This was a manmade disaster.,2
2016-05-06,oba,This was avoidable.,1
2016-05-06,oba,This was preventable.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, I'm not here to go through the full history of what happened.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"Like a lot of manufacturing towns, Flint's economy has been taking hits for decades now -- plants closing, jobs moving away.",5
2016-05-06,oba,Manufacturing has shrunk.,1
2016-05-06,oba,And that's made it harder for the city to maintain city services.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"And let's face it, government officials at every level weren't attentive to potential problems the way they should have been.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"So they start getting short-staffed, they start getting a shrinking tax base, more demand for services.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"Things start getting strained, and there's not enough help from the outside.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"And then when Flint's finances collapsed, an emergency manager was put in place whose mandate was primarily to cut at all costs.",7
2016-05-06,oba,And then some very poor decisions were made.,3
2016-05-06,oba,All these things contributed to this crisis.,3
2016-05-06,oba,Many of you know the story.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, I do not believe that anybody consciously wanted to hurt the people in Flint.",5
2016-05-06,oba,And this is not the place to sort out every screw-up that resulted in contaminated water.,7
2016-05-06,oba,"But I do think there is a larger issue that we have to acknowledge, because I do think that part of what contributed to this crisis was a broader mindset, a bigger attitude, a corrosive attitude that exists in our politics and exists in too many levels of our government.",12
2016-05-06,oba,And it's a mindset that believes that less government is the highest good no matter what.,6
2016-05-06,oba,"It's a mindset that says environmental rules designed to keep your water clean or your air clean are optional, or not that important, or unnecessarily burden businesses or taxpayers.",8
2016-05-06,oba,"It's an ideology that undervalues the common good, says we're all on our own and what's in it for me, and how do I do well, but I'm not going to invest in what we need as a community.",7
2016-05-06,oba,"And, as a consequence, you end up seeing an underinvestment in the things that we all share that make us safe, that make us whole, that give us the ability to pursue our own individual dreams.",8
2016-05-06,oba,So we underinvest in pipes underground.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"We underinvest in bridges that we drive on, and the roads that connect us, and the schools that move us forward.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"And this is part of the attitude, this is part of the mindset:  We especially underinvest when the communities that are put at risk are poor, or don't have a lot of political clout -- and so are not as often heard in the corridors of power.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"And this kind of thinking -- this myth that government is always the enemy; that forgets that our government is us -- it's us; that it's an extension of us, ourselves -- that attitude is as corrosive to our democracy as the stuff that resulted in lead in your water.",10
2016-05-06,oba,Because what happens is it leads to systematic neglect.,3
2016-05-06,oba,It leads to carelessness and callousness.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"It leads to a lot of hidden disasters that you don't always read about and aren't as flashy, but that over time diminish the life of a community and make it harder for our young people to succeed.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"In one of the roundtables, I was listening to somebody -- I think it was a pastor who told me, you know, it made us feel like we didn't count.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"And you can't have a democracy where people feel like they don't count, where people feel like they're not heard.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"And that attitude ignores how this country was built, our entire history -- which is based on the idea that we're all connected and that what happens in a community like Flint matters everybody, and that there are things that we can only do together, as a nation, as a people, as a state, as a city that no man is an island.",12
2016-05-06,oba,We've been debating this since the Republic began:  What are our individual responsibilities and what are our collective responsibilities.,5
2016-05-06,oba,And that's a good debate.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"But I've always believed what the first Republican President, a guy named Abraham Lincoln, said.",6
2016-05-06,oba,He said we should do individually those things that we do best by ourselves.,5
2016-05-06,oba,"But through our government, we should do together what we can't do as well for ourselves.",3
2016-05-06,oba,"So it doesn't matter how hard you work, how responsible you are, or how well you raise your kids -- you can't set up a whole water system for a city.",4
2016-05-06,oba,That's not something you do by yourself.,3
2016-05-06,oba,You do it with other people.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"You can't hire your own fire department, or your own police force, or your own army.",3
2016-05-06,oba,There are things we have to do together -- basic things that we all benefit from.,5
2016-05-06,oba,And that's how we invested in a rail system and a highway system.,5
2016-05-06,oba,That's how we invested in public schools.,4
2016-05-06,oba,That's how we invested in science and research.,4
2016-05-06,oba,These how we invested in community colleges and land grant colleges like Michigan State.,7
2016-05-06,oba,Can I get some water?,2
2016-05-06,oba,Come on up here.,1
2016-05-06,oba,Give me some water.,2
2016-05-06,oba,I want a glass of water.,3
2016-05-06,oba,I want a glass of water.,3
2016-05-06,oba,Sit down.,1
2016-05-06,oba,I'm all right.,2
2016-05-06,oba,I'm going to get a glass of water right here.,4
2016-05-06,oba,Let's make sure we find one.,4
2016-05-06,oba,It will be filtered.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"Hold on, I'm going to talk about that in a second.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"Settle down, everybody.",1
2016-05-06,oba,Where was I?,1
2016-05-06,oba,We invested in our communities and our cities.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"And by making those investments in the common good, we invested in ourselves.",5
2016-05-06,oba,That's the platform we create that allows each of us independently to succeed.,6
2016-05-06,oba,That's what made America great.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"So the people in Flint, and across Michigan, and around the country -- individuals and church groups and non-for-profits and community organizations -- you've proven that the American people will step up when required.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"And our volunteers, our non-for-profits, they're the lifeblood of our communities.",5
2016-05-06,oba,We so appreciate what you do.,2
2016-05-06,oba,But volunteers don't build county water systems and keep lead from leaching into our drinking glasses.,6
2016-05-06,oba,We can't rely on faith groups to reinforce bridges and repave runways at the airport.,5
2016-05-06,oba,"We can't ask second-graders, even ones as patriotic as Isiah Britt who raised all that money, to raise enough money to keep our kids healthy.",8
2016-05-06,oba,"You hear a lot about government overreach, how Obama -- he's for big government.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"Listen, it's not government overreach to say that our government is responsible for making sure you can wash your hands in your own sink, or shower in your own home, or cook for your family.",10
2016-05-06,oba,These are the most basic services.,3
2016-05-06,oba,There is no more basic element sustaining human life than water.,5
2016-05-06,oba,It's not too much to expect for all Americans that their water is going to be safe.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, where do we go from here?",2
2016-05-06,oba,"Well, I'm still waiting for my water.",3
2016-05-06,oba,Somebody obviously didn't hear me.,1
2016-05-06,oba,Usually I get my water pretty quick.,2
2016-05-06,oba,Hold on a second.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, the reason I know I'm okay is because I already had some Flint water.",3
2016-05-06,oba,There we go.,1
2016-05-06,oba,I really did need a glass of water.,3
2016-05-06,oba,This is not a stunt.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, I'm going to talk about this.",3
2016-05-06,oba,Everybody settle down.,1
2016-05-06,oba,This is a feisty crowd.,2
2016-05-06,oba,Hold on a second.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"All right, everybody settle down.",2
2016-05-06,oba,I got some serious points to make here.,2
2016-05-06,oba,So where do we go from here?,2
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, Mayor Weaver has a plan to fix the pipes in Flint.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"And unfortunately, because the state initially cut so many corners, it's going to end up being more expensive -- much more expensive now than it would have been to avert the disaster in the first place.",5
2016-05-06,oba,But the good news is that Michigan does have funds it can use from the federal government to help Flint.,6
2016-05-06,oba,The Governor indicated that in his budget he has put forward additional funds to replace the pipes.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"In order for it to happen -- and I said this to the Mayor and the Governor; I had them both in my car, the Beast -- I told them I wasn't going to let either of them out until we figured this out.",6
2016-05-06,oba,I had Secret Service surrounding everybody.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"But what I said was, is that the city and the state and the federal government, everybody is going to have to work together to get this done.",6
2016-05-06,oba,So it's not going to happen overnight.,2
2016-05-06,oba,But we have to get started.,2
2016-05-06,oba,We have to get the money flowing.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"We've got to work with our plumbers and pipefitters, but also train local residents and start getting apprenticeship programs going -- so that even as we're trying to deal with this disaster, we're also hopefully lifting people up and giving them an opportunity for employment.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"Congress, led by your congressional delegation, needs to act in a bipartisan fashion, do their job, make sure Flint has the necessary resources.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"And so it's long past time that Flint has a well-managed, monitored, modern water system that protects not just against lead, but other contaminants.",5
2016-05-06,oba,All right?,1
2016-05-06,oba,So that's our goal.,2
2016-05-06,oba,That's one goal.,2
2016-05-06,oba,But we've got to do more than just ensure the integrity and safety of your water for the long term.,7
2016-05-06,oba,"What we also have to do is work as one team -- federal, state, and local leaders, Democrats and Republicans -- to address some of the broader issues that have been raised by this crisis.",9
2016-05-06,oba,The federal officials I met with today are committed to staying on the job until we get it done.,6
2016-05-06,oba,"But that requires the state of Michigan to step up and be fully invested in this process, as well.",5
2016-05-06,oba,Today's vote in Lansing to increase funding for health care was a good start.,6
2016-05-06,oba,But part of keeping the faith with the people of Flint means making sure that you're first in line for the jobs this effort will create.,8
2016-05-06,oba,"It means that since the state voted this afternoon to expand Medicaid, every child who lived in Flint while the water was bad needs to be able to get seen by a doctor, diagnosed, make sure that there's follow-up.",14
2016-05-06,oba,"We can't just promise it, we've got to deliver it.",2
2016-05-06,oba,And that means everybody has got to cooperate.,3
2016-05-06,oba,Everybody has got to cooperate.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"And keeping the faith with you also means the state has to step up and deliver the resources that will help not only fix the water, but transform Flint so that it is once again a functioning city with the capacity and the democratic structures to work.",9
2016-05-06,oba,The city government has to be on a firm foundation.,4
2016-05-06,oba,The mayor can't do it by herself.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"She's got to have a team and a staff, and there's got to be a budget that works, that's sustainable, and a plan for long-term economic development, and a plan to make sure that health care is available to all of our kids, and a plan to make sure that education is top-notch in this city, and that more jobs are being created.",11
2016-05-06,oba,And that will require many more of the good work that we've seen from citizens and community groups who care about your families.,10
2016-05-06,oba,But it's not enough just to fix the water.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"We've got to fix the culture of neglect, the mindset I was talking about -- that has degraded too many schools and too many roads and hurt too many futures.",7
2016-05-06,oba,We've got to fix the mindset that only leaves people cynical about our government.,7
2016-05-06,oba,"Our government is us -- of us, by us, for us -- the people.",5
2016-05-06,oba,So we've got a lot of work to do.,3
2016-05-06,oba,But I'm here to tell you I'm prepared to work with you on this.,6
2016-05-06,oba,I'm paying attention.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, a couple of specific things I want to address.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"These aren't in my prepared remarks, but this is what I gathered from the conversations that I had.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"I'm in Flint right now, not Detroit.",2
2016-05-06,oba,But I do love Detroit.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"And their school needs support, and there is -- some of that same mindset has hurt the schools there.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"But listen up, because this is drawn from the conversations I had with many of your neighbors and friends, as well as the federal response teams that I sent out here a while back.",10
2016-05-06,oba,We're going to do everything we can to accelerate getting new pipes here in Flint.,7
2016-05-06,oba,"But even with all the money, even with an efficient, speeded-up process, it's going to take a while for all the pipes to be replaced.",4
2016-05-06,oba,It's not going to happen next month.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"It's not going to happen six months from now, where all the pipes in Flint are going to be replaced.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"We've got to get started, and you need to see that it's getting started and that progress is being made.",6
2016-05-06,oba,But it's not going to happen overnight.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"Even if we get all the plumbers and pipefitters, and we get some more apprentices trained -- even if we do all that, it's going to take some time.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"And so one of the things I heard talking to a lot of your neighbors is, boy, right now it's rough just trying to figure out how to get bottled water on the way home from work, and you're trying to just shower real quick, and people are still concerned about what's safe and what information is correct and what is not.",9
2016-05-06,oba,"So I do want to just tell you what I know, based on not just what I've been reading in the papers, but what our top scientists have told me.",7
2016-05-06,oba,"The first is that while you are waiting to get your pipes replaced, you need to have a filter installed, and use that filter.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"And if you do use that filter, then the water is safe to consume for children over the age of six and who are not pregnant.",7
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, hold on a second.",2
2016-05-06,oba,"Don't just start shouting, okay?",2
2016-05-06,oba,Because this is the problem -- we're going to have to solve this problem.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"And if people don't listen to each other, then it's not going to get fixed.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"So I'm telling you -- and I promise you, I'm really good at stirring folks up.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"So if I want to just come here and stir folks up, I know how to do that.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"But that's not actually going to solve the problem, all right?",3
2016-05-06,oba,"So I'm telling what I know, because I guarantee you that the scientists who work for me, if they tell me something -- which I'm saying in front of all those cameras -- turns out to be wrong, that person will not have a job.",11
2016-05-06,oba,"So although I understand the fear and concern that people have, and it is entirely legitimate, what the science tells us at this stage is you should not drink any of the water that is not filtered.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"But if you get the filter and use it properly, that water can be consumed.",3
2016-05-06,oba,That's point number one.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"And you can get those filters free, and people will help install them if you need help -- particularly seniors who may have trouble going back and forth and trying to get a whole bunch of bottles of water and so forth.",15
2016-05-06,oba,So that's information that I trust and I believe.,3
2016-05-06,oba,That's point number one.,2
2016-05-06,oba,Point number two:  Every child in Flint who may have consumed water during the course of this tragedy -- and that is the overwhelming majority of children here -- should get checked.,8
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, the reason that's important is because lead is a serious issue.",3
2016-05-06,oba,"And if undiagnosed and not dealt with, it can lead to some long-term problems.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"But -- and this is really important, so I want everybody to pay attention -- if you know that your child may have been exposed and you go to a health clinic, a doctor, a provider, and are working with them, then your child will be fine.",8
2016-05-06,oba,"And the reason I can say that with some confidence is not just based on science, but based on the fact that keep in mind that it wasn't until the ‘80s where we started banning lead in paint, lead in toys, lead in gasoline.",11
2016-05-06,oba,"So if you are my age, or older, or maybe even a little bit younger, you got some lead in your system when you were growing up.",6
2016-05-06,oba,You did.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"I am sure that somewhere, when I was two years old, I was taking a chip of paint, tasting it, and I got some lead.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"Or sometimes toys were painted with lead, and you were chewing on them.",3
2016-05-06,oba,"Now, I say that not to make light of the situation.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"We know now what we didn't know then, which is it can cause problems if children get exposed to lead at elevated levels.",8
2016-05-06,oba,"But the point is that as long as kids are getting good health care, and folks are paying attention, and they're getting a good education, and they have community support, and they're getting some good home training, and they are in a community that is loving and nurturing and thriving, these kids will be fine.",11
2016-05-06,oba,"And I don't want anybody to start thinking that somehow all the kids in Flint are going to have problems for the rest of their lives, because that's not true.",10
2016-05-06,oba,That is not true.,1
2016-05-06,oba,And I don't want that stigma to be established in the minds of kids.,5
2016-05-06,oba,We've learned a lot of things since I was a kid.,3
2016-05-06,oba,I used to have adults blowing smoke in my face all the time.,6
2016-05-06,oba,We didn't use seat belts.,2
2016-05-06,oba,We wrapped dry-cleaning bags around us and thought that was funny.,3
2016-05-06,oba,Folks didn't know.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"No, no, but the reason I think this is important is because I heard from a lot of folks who were saying how moms and dads were feeling guilty.",9
2016-05-06,oba,They're feeling sad.,1
2016-05-06,oba,They're feeling depressed.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"Oh, Lord, what's -- how is this going to affect my child.",3
2016-05-06,oba,And it's right to be angry.,2
2016-05-06,oba,But you can't get passive.,1
2016-05-06,oba,You can't just suddenly sit back and sink into despair.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"Our kids will be fine, but you have to now take action.",3
2016-05-06,oba,Don't wait for somebody else to reach out and ask whether your child has gotten a checkup recently.,5
2016-05-06,oba,We just expanded Medicaid.,1
2016-05-06,oba,Go take your child to that doctor.,3
2016-05-06,oba,Use that health system.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"And so community organizations, churches, et cetera, one of the things that we need to do is -- and I've talked to the Governor and the Mayor about this -- is set up a system of outreach so that we're getting everybody as a village looking out for every child, making sure that they're getting checked up, making sure they've got pediatric care, making sure they're being tested effectively, making sure then that they're getting nutritious food.",9
2016-05-06,oba,"Just to give you an example, we know that if kids are getting vegetables and eating properly -- that, just by itself, is going to have some impact on any effects of lead.",7
2016-05-06,oba,But I know that here in Flint there are whole neighborhoods that don't even have a supermarket.,5
2016-05-06,oba,So we're going to have to figure out how to get supermarkets in those communities.,6
2016-05-06,oba,"And in the meantime, we got to help make sure that those kids are getting the nutrition they need.",7
2016-05-06,oba,"So I say all this just to indicate you should be angry, but channel that anger.",3
2016-05-06,oba,"You should be hurt, but don't sink into despair.",3
2016-05-06,oba,"And most of all, do not somehow communicate to our children here in this city that they're going to be saddled with problems for the rest of their lives.",9
2016-05-06,oba,Because they will not.,1
2016-05-06,oba,"They'll do just fine, just like I did fine with a single mom, and a lot of you did fine growing up in a tough neighborhood.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"They'll make it as long as we're there for them and looking after them, and doing the right thing for them and giving them the resources that they need.",8
2016-05-06,oba,Don't lose hope.,1
2016-05-06,oba,Don't lose hope.,1
2016-05-06,oba,I talked longer than I was going to.,3
2016-05-06,oba,But I feel strongly about this whole issue with kids now.,4
2016-05-06,oba,Kids rise to the expectations we set for them.,5
2016-05-06,oba,A lot of kids in Flint already got some crosses they got to bear.,5
2016-05-06,oba,"They've already got people telling them, oh, it's too tough for you because you're black or you're poor.",4
2016-05-06,oba,They will do fine as long as we do right by them.,3
2016-05-06,oba,And that's my intention.,2
2016-05-06,oba,And set high expectations for them.,2
2016-05-06,oba,Just a couple more points.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"What happened here is just an extreme example, an extreme and tragic case of what's happening in a lot of places around the country.",11
2016-05-06,oba,We've seen unacceptably high levels of lead in townships along the Jersey Shore and in North Carolina's major cities.,8
2016-05-06,oba,We've seen it in the capitals of South Carolina and Mississippi.,5
2016-05-06,oba,"And even, not long ago, lead-contaminated drinking water was found right down the street from the United States Capitol.",6
2016-05-06,oba,So Flint is just a tip of the iceberg in terms of us reinvesting in our communities.,4
2016-05-06,oba,We've seen bridges fall and levies break.,2
2016-05-06,oba,So we've got to break that mindset.,3
2016-05-06,oba,These things aren't a coincidence.,2
2016-05-06,oba,They're the same mindset that left Flint's water unsafe to drink.,6
2016-05-06,oba,And it's self-destructive when we don't invest in our communities.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"Because a lot of times the people who are against government spending, they'll say, well, the private sector is the key.",6
2016-05-06,oba,The private sector is the key for our economy.,4
2016-05-06,oba,Free markets and free enterprise are great.,3
2016-05-06,oba,But companies won't invest in a place where your infrastructure is crumbling and your roads are broke.,5
2016-05-06,oba,You're not going to start a business or be able to recruit outstanding staff if there's no safe drinking water in the city.,7
2016-05-06,oba,"So my hope is, is that this begins a national conversation about what we need to do to invest in future generations.",9
2016-05-06,oba,"And it's no secret that, on this pipeline of neglect, a lot of times it's the most poor folks who are left behind.",6
2016-05-06,oba,It's working people who are left behind.,3
2016-05-06,oba,We see it in communities across the Midwest that haven't recovered since the plants shut down.,6
2016-05-06,oba,"We see it on inner city corners where they might be able to drink the water, but they can't find a job.",7
2016-05-06,oba,We see it in the rural hills of Appalachia.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"We've got to break that mindset that says that that neighborhood over there, that's not my problem; those kids over there, they don't look like my kids exactly, so I don't have to worry about them -- out of sight, out of mind.",7
2016-05-06,oba,"We've got to break that attitude that says somehow there's an ""us"" in ""them,"" and remind ourselves that there's just one big ""we"" -- the American family, and everybody has got to look out for each other.",9
2016-05-06,oba,"Because the kids here in Flint aren't ""those"" kids, they're ""our"" kids.",5
2016-05-06,oba,That's what Scripture teaches us.,2
2016-05-06,oba,But I'm not going to start preaching in front of some pastors.,7
2016-05-06,oba,So let me just close by saying this.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"Look, I know this has been a scary time.",3
2016-05-06,oba,I know this is disappointing.,2
2016-05-06,oba,You've been let down.,1
2016-05-06,oba,But there is a sermon about a phoenix rising from these ashes.,7
2016-05-06,oba,"And there is the opportunity out of this complete screw-up, this painful tragedy, this neglect, this disappointment to actually pull together and make for a better future.",8
2016-05-06,oba,Sometimes it takes a crisis for everybody to focus their attention.,3
2016-05-06,oba,"Because there have been a lot of crises going on in Flint; they just weren't as loud and noisy, and nobody noticed.",7
2016-05-06,oba,"There are a lot of small, quiet crises going on in the lives of people around this country.",11
2016-05-06,oba,And this helps lift it up.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"And when we see it, and we understand it, and we feel it, then maybe we start making a connection with each other.",5
2016-05-06,oba,And that begins to change our mindset and improve our politics and improve our government to make it more responsive and more accountable.,7
2016-05-06,oba,"And the good news is, is that that's the natural mindset of our young people.",5
2016-05-06,oba,That's why I'm so hopeful about the people of Flint.,6
2016-05-06,oba,"That's why I'm so hopeful about America generally, is I meet young people all the time, and they've got a mindset just like Little Miss Flint here.",5
2016-05-06,oba,"She decides, I'm just going right to the President, because I think we can fix this.",4
2016-05-06,oba,"Or the mindset of Isiah raising $15,000 to help an elementary school where he's never been.",4
2016-05-06,oba,That's America.,1
2016-05-06,oba,That's who we are at our best.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"We are a nation of individuals, and we should be proud of everything that we can accomplish on our own through hard work, and grit, and looking after our own families, and making sure we're raising our children right.",8
2016-05-06,oba,But we don't do these things alone.,2
2016-05-06,oba,"Ultimately, our success is dependent on each other.",4
2016-05-06,oba,Our success is dependent on each other.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"I have had the privilege of being the President of the United States, a big office -- an office that gives me enormous power and enormous responsibility.",7
2016-05-06,oba,But the thing I've learned in that job is that I can't do it by myself.,5
2016-05-06,oba,I can't fix every problem on my own.,3
2016-05-06,oba,I need a mother-in-law who helps Michelle and me raise Malia and Sasha.,4
2016-05-06,oba,I need incredible staff who are carrying out our policies to sign people up for health care.,6
2016-05-06,oba,I've got to have our incredible men and women in uniform who are willing to go overseas and fight on behalf of our freedom.,11
2016-05-06,oba,I've got to have governors and mayors who are willing to work with me to get things done in their states and in their cities.,12
2016-05-06,oba,"And, most of all, I need fellow citizens who share the values that built this great country and are willing to work with me and work together to make it better.",11
2016-05-06,oba,I said this before:  The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen.,5
2016-05-06,oba,It's more important than the President.,4
2016-05-06,oba,More important than any senator or governor or mayor.,4
2016-05-06,oba,"It is the idea that each of us has something to contribute, each of us has something to give back.",6
2016-05-06,oba,"So, Flint, I'm here not just to say I've got your back.",4
2016-05-06,oba,I'm here not just to say that you will get help.,3
2016-05-06,oba,I'm also here to say you've got power.,3
2016-05-06,oba,I'm also here to say you count.,3
2016-05-06,oba,I'm also here to say that you can make a difference and rebuild this city better than ever.,6
2016-05-06,oba,And you'll have a friend and partner in the President of the United States.,6
2016-05-06,oba,God bless you.,1
2016-05-06,oba,God bless Flint.,1
2016-05-06,oba,God bless Michigan.,1
2016-05-06,oba,God bless the United States of America.,3
2016-06-13,oba,"d Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder -- a horrific massacre -- of dozens of innocent people.",7
2016-06-13,oba,"We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts.",8
2016-06-13,oba,"We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city.",9
2016-06-13,oba,"Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate.",7
2016-06-13,oba,"And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.",6
2016-06-13,oba,I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisors.,7
2016-06-13,oba,"The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement.",6
2016-06-13,oba,I’ve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation.,5
2016-06-13,oba,We are still learning all the facts.,2
2016-06-13,oba,This is an open investigation.,2
2016-06-13,oba,We’ve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer.,6
2016-06-13,oba,The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism.,4
2016-06-13,oba,And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what -- if any -- inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups.,7
2016-06-13,oba,What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred.,5
2016-06-13,oba,"Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us.",4
2016-06-13,oba,"This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people.",5
2016-06-13,oba,This could have been any one of our communities.,4
2016-06-13,oba,So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need -- they are going to get it.,7
2016-06-13,oba,"As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come.",4
2016-06-13,oba,We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm’s way.,9
2016-06-13,oba,"Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse.",5
2016-06-13,oba,"It’s the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough.",6
2016-06-13,oba,"This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends -- our fellow Americans -- who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.",9
2016-06-13,oba,"The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live.",7
2016-06-13,oba,"The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub -- it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.",7
2016-06-13,oba,"So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American -- regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation -- is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.",14
2016-06-13,oba,And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.,5
2016-06-13,oba,Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history.,4
2016-06-13,oba,The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle.,4
2016-06-13,oba,"This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub.",11
2016-06-13,oba,And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be.,6
2016-06-13,oba,And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.,3
2016-06-13,oba,"In the coming hours and days, we’ll learn about the victims of this tragedy.",5
2016-06-13,oba,Their names.,1
2016-06-13,oba,Their faces.,1
2016-06-13,oba,Who they were.,1
2016-06-13,oba,"The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world.",5
2016-06-13,oba,Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families -- that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable.,6
2016-06-13,oba,"And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change.",4
2016-06-13,oba,We need to demonstrate that we are defined more -- as a country -- by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us.,13
2016-06-13,oba,"As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts -- friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives.",5
2016-06-13,oba,"In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another.",5
2016-06-13,oba,We will not give in to fear or turn against each other.,5
2016-06-13,oba,"Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.",7
2016-06-13,oba,May God bless the Americans we lost this morning.,4
2016-06-13,oba,May He comfort their families.,2

2016-07-28,oba,"So, twelve years ago tonight, I addressed this convention for the very first time.",4
2016-07-28,oba,"You met my two little girls, Malia and Sasha -- now two amazing young women who just fill me with pride.",5
2016-07-28,oba,"You fell for my brilliant wife and partner Michelle, who has made me a better father and a better man; who’s gone on to inspire our nation as First Lady; and who somehow hasn’t aged a day.",6
2016-07-28,oba,I -- I know the same can’t be said for me.,4
2016-07-28,oba,"My girls remind me all the time: ""Wow, you’ve changed so much, daddy.""",3
2016-07-28,oba,And then they try to clean it up.,2
2016-07-28,oba,Yeah.,1
2016-07-28,oba,Not bad -- just more mature.,2
2016-07-28,oba,And -- And it’s true: I -- I was so young that first time in Boston.,3
2016-07-28,oba,"And...look, I'll admit maybe a little nervous addressing such a big crowd.",4
2016-07-28,oba,"But I was filled with faith, faith in America -- the generous, bighearted, hopeful country that made my story, that made all of our stories possible.",11
2016-07-28,oba,A lot’s happened over the years.,3
2016-07-28,oba,"And while this nation has been tested by war, and it's been tested recession and all manner of challenges, I stand before you again tonight, after almost two terms as your President, to tell you I am more optimistic about the future of America than every before.",9
2016-07-28,oba,How could I not be after all that we’ve achieved together?,3
2016-07-28,oba,"After the worst recession in 80 years, we’ve fought our way back.",5
2016-07-28,oba,"We’ve seen deficits come down, 401k)s recover, an auto industry set new records, unemployment reach eight-year lows, and our businesses create 15 million new jobs.",4
2016-07-28,oba,"After a century of trying, we declared that health care in America is not a privilege for a few; it is a right for everybody.",6
2016-07-28,oba,"After decades of talk, we finally began to wean ourselves off foreign oil.",4
2016-07-28,oba,We doubled our production of clean energy.,4
2016-07-28,oba,We brought more of our troops home to their families.,4
2016-07-28,oba,And we delivered justice to Osama bin Laden.,3
2016-07-28,oba,"Through diplomacy, we shut down Iran’s nuclear weapons program.",3
2016-07-28,oba,We opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba; brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our children.,7
2016-07-28,oba,"We put policies in place to help students with loans, protect consumers from fraud, cut veteran homelessness almost in half.",5
2016-07-28,oba,"And through countless acts of quiet courage, America learned that love has no limits, and marriage equality is now a reality across the land.",6
2016-07-28,oba,"By so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started.",5
2016-07-28,oba,"And through every victory and every setback, I’ve insisted that change is never easy, and never quick; that we wouldn’t meet all of our challenges in one term, or one presidency, or even in one lifetime.",5
2016-07-28,oba,"So tonight, I’m here to tell you that, yes, we've still got more work to do -- more work to do for every American still in need of a good job or a raise, paid leave or a decent retirement; for every child who needs a sturdier ladder out of poverty or a world-class education; for everyone who has not yet felt the progress of these past seven and a half years.",11
2016-07-28,oba,"We need to keep making our streets safer, and our criminal justice system fairer; our homeland more secure; our world more peaceful and sustainable for the next generation.",6
2016-07-28,oba,"We’re not done perfecting our union, or living up to our founding creed -- that all of us are created equal; all of use are free in the eyes of God.",7
2016-07-28,oba,And that work involves a big choice this November.,2
2016-07-28,oba,"I think it's fair to say, this is not your typical election.",3
2016-07-28,oba,It’s not just a choice between parties or policies -- the usual debates between left and right.,7
2016-07-28,oba,"This is a more fundamental choice -- about who we are as a people, and whether we stay true to this great American experiment in self-government.",9
2016-07-28,oba,"Look, we Democrats have always had plenty of differences with the Republican Party, and there’s nothing wrong with that; it’s precisely this contest of ideathat pushes our country forward.",7
2016-07-28,oba,But what we heard in Cleveland last week wasn’t particularly Republican -- and it sure wasn’t conservative.,3
2016-07-28,oba,"What we heard was a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other, and turn away from the rest of the world.",11
2016-07-28,oba,"There were no serious solutions to pressing problems -- just the fanning of resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate.",5
2016-07-28,oba,And that is not the America I know.,2
2016-07-28,oba,The America I know is full of courage and optimism and ingenuity.,5
2016-07-28,oba,The America I know is decent and generous.,2
2016-07-28,oba,"Sure, we have real anxieties about paying the bills, and protecting our kids, caring for a sick parent.",8
2016-07-28,oba,"We get frustrated with political gridlock, and worry about racial divisions.",4
2016-07-28,oba,We are shocked and saddened by the madness of Orlando -- or Nice.,7
2016-07-28,oba,There are pockets of America that never recovered from factory closures -- men who took pride in hard work and providing for their families who now feel forgotten; parents who wonder whether their kids will have the same opportunities that we had.,11
2016-07-28,oba,All of that is real.,3
2016-07-28,oba,We are challenged to do better; to be better.,3
2016-07-28,oba,"But as I’ve traveled this country, through all 50 states, as I’ve rejoiced with you and mourned with you, what I have also seen, more than anything, is what is right with America.",7
2016-07-28,oba,I see people working hard and starting businesses.,4
2016-07-28,oba,I see people teaching kids and serving our country.,4
2016-07-28,oba,"I see engineers inventing stuff, doctors coming up with new cures.",4
2016-07-28,oba,"I see a younger generation full of energy and new ideas, not constrained by what is, ready to seize what ought to be.",9
2016-07-28,oba,"And most of all, I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together -- black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big, bold country that we love.",11
2016-07-28,oba,That's what I see.,2
2016-07-28,oba,That's the America I know!,2
2016-07-28,oba,"And there is only one candidate in this race who believes in that future, has devoted her life to that future; a mother and a grandmother who would do anything to help our children thrive; a leader with real plans to break down barriers, and blast through glass ceilings, and widen the circle of opportunity to every single American -- the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.",10
2016-07-28,oba,"Let me tell you, eight years ago, you may remember Hillary and I were rivals for the Democratic nomination.",5
2016-07-28,oba,We battled for a year and a half.,4
2016-07-28,oba,"Let me tell you, it was tough, because Hillary was tough.",4
2016-07-28,oba,I was worn out.,1
2016-07-28,oba,"She was doing everything I was doing, but just like Ginger Rogers, it was backwards in heels.",4
2016-07-28,oba,"And every time I thought I might have the race won, Hillary just came back stronger.",6
2016-07-28,oba,"But after it was all over, I asked Hillary to join my team.",3
2016-07-28,oba,And she was a little surprised.,3
2016-07-28,oba,Some of my staff was surprised.,4
2016-07-28,oba,But ultimately she said yes -- because she knew that what was at stake was bigger than either of us.,7
2016-07-28,oba,"And for four years -- for four years, I had a front-row seat to her intelligence, her judgment, and her discipline.",5
2016-07-28,oba,"I came to realize that her unbelievable work ethic wasn’t for praise, it wasn’t for attention -- that she was in this for everyone who needs a champion.",6
2016-07-28,oba,"I understood that after all these years, she has never forgotten just who she’s fighting for.",4
2016-07-28,oba,"Hillary has still got the tenacity that she had as a young woman, working at the Children’s Defense Fund, going door-to-door to ultimately make sure kids with disabilities could get a quality education.",8
2016-07-28,oba,"She’s still got the heart she showed as our First Lady, working with Congress to help push through a Children’s Health Insurance Program that to this day protects millions of kids.",7
2016-07-28,oba,"She’s still seared with the memory of every American she met who lost loved ones on 9/11 -- which is why, as a Senator from New York, she fought so hard for funding to help first responders, to help the city rebuild; why, as Secretary of State, she sat with me in the Situation Room and forcefully argued in favor of the mission that took out bin Laden.",14
2016-07-28,oba,"You know, nothing truly prepares you for the demands of the Oval Office.",5
2016-07-28,oba,You can read about it.,2
2016-07-28,oba,You can study it.,1
2016-07-28,oba,"But until you’ve sat at that desk, you don’t know what it’s like to manage a global crisis, or send young people to war.",5
2016-07-28,oba,But Hillary has been in the room; she’s been part of those decisions.,4
2016-07-28,oba,"She knows what’s at stake in the decisions our government makes -- what’s at stake for the working family, for the senior citizen, or the small business owner, for the soldier, for the veteran.",6
2016-07-28,oba,"And even in the midst of crisis, she listens to people, and she keeps her cool, and she treats everybody with respect.",4
2016-07-28,oba,"And no matter how daunting the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never, ever quits.",6
2016-07-28,oba,That is the Hillary I know.,3
2016-07-28,oba,That’s the Hillary I’ve come to admire.,4
2016-07-28,oba,"And that’s why I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman -- not me, not Bill, nobody -- more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as President of the United States of America.",14
2016-07-28,oba,"I hope you don't mind, Bill, but I was just telling the truth, man.",3
2016-07-28,oba,"And, by the way, in case you’re wondering about her judgment, take a look at her choice of running mate.",6
2016-07-28,oba,"Tim Kaine is as good a man, as humble and as committed a public servant as anybody that I know.",7
2016-07-28,oba,I know his family.,2
2016-07-28,oba,I love Anne.,1
2016-07-28,oba,I love their kids.,2
2016-07-28,oba,He will be a great Vice President.,2
2016-07-28,oba,"He will make Hillary a better President -- just like my dear friend and brother, Joe Biden, has made me a better President.",5
2016-07-28,oba,"Now, Hillary has real plans to address the concerns she’s heard from you on the campaign trail.",7
2016-07-28,oba,"She’s got specific ideas to invest in new jobs, to help workers share in their company’s profits, to help put kids in preschool and put students through college without taking on a ton of debt.",9
2016-07-28,oba,That’s what leaders do.,2
2016-07-28,oba,And then there’s Donald Trump.,2
2016-07-28,oba,"You know, the Donald is not really a plans guy.",3
2016-07-28,oba,"He’s not really a facts guy, either.",2
2016-07-28,oba,"He calls himself a business guy, which is true, but I have to say, I know plenty of businessmen and women who’ve achieved remarkable success without leaving a trail of lawsuits, and unpaid workers, and people feeling like they got cheated.",13
2016-07-28,oba,Does anyone really believe that a guy who’s spent his 70 years on this Earth showing no regard for working people is suddenly going to be your champion?,6
2016-07-28,oba,Your voice?,1
2016-07-28,oba,"If so, you should vote for him.",2
2016-07-28,oba,"But if you’re someone who’s truly concerned about paying your bills, if you're really concerned about pocketbook issues and seeing the economy grow, and creating more opportunity for everybody, then the choice isn’t even close.",8
2016-07-28,oba,"If you want someone with a lifelong track record of fighting for higher wages, and better benefits, and a fairer tax code, and a bigger voice for workers, and stronger regulations on Wall Street, then you should vote for Hillary Clinton.",10
2016-07-28,oba,"If you’re rightly concerned about who’s going to keep you and your family safe in a dangerous world, well, the choice is even clearer.",9
2016-07-28,oba,"Hillary Clinton is respected around the world -- not just by leaders, but by the people they serve.",5
2016-07-28,oba,I have to say this.,2
2016-07-28,oba,People outside of the United States do not understand what’s going on in this election.,5
2016-07-28,oba,They really don't.,1
2016-07-28,oba,Because they know Hillary.,1
2016-07-28,oba,They’ve seen her work.,2
2016-07-28,oba,"She’s worked closely with our intelligence teams, our diplomats, our military.",5
2016-07-28,oba,She has the judgment and the experience and the temperament to meet the threat from terrorism.,4
2016-07-28,oba,It’s not new to her.,3
2016-07-28,oba,"Our troops have pounded ISIL without mercy, taking out their leaders, taking back territory.",3
2016-07-28,oba,And I know Hillary won’t relent until ISIL is destroyed.,3
2016-07-28,oba,She will finish the job.,2
2016-07-28,oba,"And she will do it without resorting to torture, or banning entire religions from entering our country.",5
2016-07-28,oba,She is fit and she is ready to be the next Commander-in-Chief.,6
2016-07-28,oba,"Meanwhile, Donald Trump calls our military a disaster.",2
2016-07-28,oba,"Apparently, he doesn’t know the men and women who make up the strongest fighting force the world has ever known.",6
2016-07-28,oba,He suggests America is weak.,2
2016-07-28,oba,"He must not hear the billions of men and women and children, from the Baltics to Burma, who still look to America to be the light of freedom and dignity and human rights.",11
2016-07-28,oba,"He cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein, tells our NATO allies that stood by our side after 9/11 that they have to pay up if they want our protection.",8
2016-07-28,oba,"Well, America’s promises do not come with a price tag.",3
2016-07-28,oba,We meet our commitments.,2
2016-07-28,oba,We bear our burdens.,2
2016-07-28,oba,That’s one of the reasons why almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office.,8
2016-07-28,oba,America is already great.,1
2016-07-28,oba,America is already strong.,1
2016-07-28,oba,"And I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.",4
2016-07-28,oba,"In fact, it doesn’t depend on any one person.",3
2016-07-28,oba,"And that, in the end, may be the biggest difference in this election -- the meaning of our democracy.",5
2016-07-28,oba,Ronald Reagan called America “a shining city on a hill.”  Donald Trump calls it “a divided crime scene” that only he can fix.,4
2016-07-28,oba,It doesn’t matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they’ve been in decades -- because he’s not actually offering any real solutions to those issues.,5
2016-07-28,oba,"He’s just offering slogans, and he’s offering fear.",2
2016-07-28,oba,"He’s betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election.",5
2016-07-28,oba,And that's another bet that Donald Trump will lose.,4
2016-07-28,oba,And the reason he'll lose it is because he’s selling the American people short.,3
2016-07-28,oba,We're not a fragile people.,2
2016-07-28,oba,We're not a frightful people.,2
2016-07-28,oba,Our power doesn’t come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way.,6
2016-07-28,oba,We don’t look to be ruled.,2
2016-07-28,oba,"Our power comes from those immortal declarations first put to paper right here in Philadelphia all those years ago:  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that We the People, can form a more perfect union.",8
2016-07-28,oba,That's who we are.,2
2016-07-28,oba,That’s our birthright -- the capacity to shape our own destiny.,5
2016-07-28,oba,That’s what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny and our GIs to liberate a continent.,7
2016-07-28,oba,"It’s what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot, and marchers to cross a bridge in Selma, and workers to organize and fight for collective bargaining and better wages.",8
2016-07-28,oba,America has never been about what one person says he’ll do for us.,5
2016-07-28,oba,"It’s about what can be achieved by us, together through the hard and slow, and sometimes frustrating, but ultimately enduring work of self-government.",7
2016-07-28,oba,And that’s what Hillary Clinton understands.,3

2016-07-28,oba,Hillary knows we can work through racial divides in this country when we realize the worry black parents feel when their son leaves the house isn’t so different than what a brave cop’s family feels when he puts on the blue and goes to work; that we can honor police and treat every community fairly.,11
2016-07-28,oba,We can do that.,1
2016-07-28,oba,And she knows -- she knows that acknowledging problems that have festered for decades isn’t making race relations worse -- it’s creating the possibility for people of goodwill to join and make things better.,7
2016-07-28,oba,"Hillary knows we can insist on a lawful and orderly immigration system while still seeing striving students and their toiling parents as loving families, not criminals or rapists; families that came here for the same reason our forebears came -- to work and to study, and to make a better life, in a place where we can talk and worship and love as we please.",9

2016-07-28,oba,She has been caricatured by the right and by some on the left.,6
2016-07-28,oba,She has been accused of everything you can imagine -- and some things that you cannot.,4
2016-07-28,oba,But she knows that’s what happens when you’re under a microscope for 40 years.,8
2016-07-28,oba,She knows that sometimes during those 40 years she’s made mistakes -- just like I have; just like we all do.,5

2016-07-28,oba,"That’s what happens when you’re the kind of citizen Teddy Roosevelt once described -- not the timid souls who criticize from the sidelines, but someone “who is actually in the arena...who strives valiantly; who errs...but who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement.”

Hillary Clinton is that woman in the arena.",8
2016-07-28,oba,She’s been there for us -- even if we haven’t always noticed.,2

2016-07-28,oba,Thank you for this incredible journey.,3
2016-07-28,oba,Let’s keep it going.,3
2016-07-28,oba,God bless you.,1
2016-07-28,oba,God bless the United States of America.,3
2016-08-17,oba,"Well, to begin with, I just want to say thank you to the outstanding officials behind me who have been on the ground, working 24/7 since this flood happened.",8
2016-08-17,oba,It begins with outstanding leadership from the top -- with Governor John Bel Edwards.,5
2016-08-17,oba,And we very much appreciate all the outstanding work he’s done.,3
2016-08-17,oba,"His better half, the First Lady of Louisiana, I know has been by his side every step of the way, and we are grateful for her.",4
2016-08-17,oba,I know they’ve got their own cleaning-up to do because the Governor’s Mansion was flooded as well.,5
2016-08-17,oba,"In addition, I want to acknowledge Senator Bill Cassidy; Senator David Vitter; Representative Garret Graves; Representative Cedric Richmond; the Mayor of Baton Rouge, Kip Holden; and somebody who I can't brag enough about, one of the best hires I made as President -- the Administrator of FEMA, Craig Fugate, who has done such an outstanding job not just in dealing with this particular incident, but has really rebuilt FEMA so that there’s a change of culture.",3
2016-08-17,oba,"And everybody knows that when a disaster happens, FEMA is going to be there on the ground, cooperating with state and local officials rapidly and with attention to detail, and keeping the families who’ve been affected uppermost in their minds.",9
2016-08-17,oba,So we very much appreciate everything Craig has done.,3
2016-08-17,oba,"It's hard, by the way, for Craig to be here because he’s a Florida Gator -- and he’s been seeing a lot of LSU T-shirts as we've been passing by.",5
2016-08-17,oba,I just had a chance to see some of the damage from the historic floods here in Louisiana.,10
2016-08-17,oba,"I come here, first and foremost, to say that the prayers of the entire nation are with everybody who lost loved ones.",7
2016-08-17,oba,We are heartbroken by the loss of life.,4
2016-08-17,oba,There are also people who are still desperately trying to track down friends and family.,5
2016-08-17,oba,We’re going to keep on helping them every way that we can.,6
2016-08-17,oba,"As I think anybody who can see just the streets, much less the inside of the homes here, people’s lives have been upended by this flood.",5
2016-08-17,oba,Local businesses have suffered some terrible damage.,2
2016-08-17,oba,"Families have, in some cases, lost homes.",3
2016-08-17,oba,"They’ve certainly lost possessions, priceless keepsakes.",3
2016-08-17,oba,"I was just speaking to a young woman whose husband died shortly after the birth of her second child, and she was talking about how her daughter was trying to gather all the keepsakes that she had in her bedroom, but reminded her of her father.",9
2016-08-17,oba,And that gives you some sense that this is not just about property damage.,5
2016-08-17,oba,This is about people’s roots.,4
2016-08-17,oba,"You also have a situation where there are a lot of kids who are supposed to start a new school year, and they’re going to need some special help and support for a while.",9
2016-08-17,oba,"Sometimes when these kinds of things happen, it can seem a little bit too much to bear.",4
2016-08-17,oba,But what I want the people of Louisiana to know is that you’re not alone on this.,5
2016-08-17,oba,"Even after the TV cameras leave, the whole country is going to continue to support you and help you until we get folks back in their homes and lives are rebuilt.",8
2016-08-17,oba,And the reason I can say that with confidence is because that's what Americans do in times like this.,8
2016-08-17,oba,I saw it when I visited displaced Louisianans when I came down here as a senator after Katrina.,6
2016-08-17,oba,I saw it when I visited New Orleans for the 10th anniversary last year.,4
2016-08-17,oba,"I know how resilient the people of Louisiana are, and I know that you will rebuild again.",4
2016-08-17,oba,And what I've seen today proves it.,2
2016-08-17,oba,"I want to thank all the first responders, the National Guard, all the good neighbors who were in a boat, going around and making sure people were safe, showing extraordinary heroism  -- in some cases, risking their own lives.",8
2016-08-17,oba,"Governor Edwards, the state of Louisiana, the city, the parish governments, they’ve all stepped up under incredibly difficult circumstances.",6
2016-08-17,oba,I just want to thank the people on this block.,4
2016-08-17,oba,"As I was walking down, one woman at the end, elderly, she was on her own.",4
2016-08-17,oba,She had just lost her daughter.,2
2016-08-17,oba,"But you had a young man next door who was helping out his father, but had also offered to help out that neighbor, so that she could salvage as much as she could and start the process of rebuilding.",6
2016-08-17,oba,"With respect to the federal response, over a week ago I directed the federal government to mobilize and do everything we could to help.",5
2016-08-17,oba,FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate arrived here a week ago to help lead that effort.,4
2016-08-17,oba,Secretary of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson visited last week to make sure state and local officials are getting what they need.,5
2016-08-17,oba,"To give you a sense of the magnitude of the situation here, more than 100,000 people have applied for federal assistance so far.",7
2016-08-17,oba,"As of today, federal support has reached $127 million.",3
2016-08-17,oba,"That’s for help like temporary rental assistance, essential home repairs, and flood insurance payments.",8
2016-08-17,oba,FEMA is also working with Louisiana around the clock to help people who were displaced by floods find temporary housing.,6
2016-08-17,oba,"And any Louisiana family that needs help, you can find your nearest disaster recovery center by visiting FEMA.gov, or calling 1-800-621-FEMA.",5
2016-08-17,oba,"I’m going to repeat that:  FEMA.gov, or 1-800-621-FEMA.",5
2016-08-17,oba,"Now, federal assistance alone is not going to be enough to make people’s lives whole again.",6
2016-08-17,oba,So I’m asking every American to do what you can to help get families and local businesses back on their feet.,7
2016-08-17,oba,"If you want help -- if you want to help, Governor Edwards put together some ways to start at VolunteerLouisiana.gov.",4
2016-08-17,oba,That’s VolunteerLouisiana.gov.,1
2016-08-17,oba,"And the reason this is important is because even though federal money is moving out, volunteer help actually helps the state because it can offset some of its costs.",6
2016-08-17,oba,"Obviously, private donations are going to be extremely important, as well.",3
2016-08-17,oba,"We want to thank the Red Cross for everything they’re doing, but there are a lot of private, philanthropic organizations, churches, parishes around the state and around the country who want to help, as well.",11
2016-08-17,oba,And that how we’re going to make sure that everybody is able to get back on their feet.,9
2016-08-17,oba,"So let me just remind folks:  Sometimes once the floodwaters pass, people’s attention spans pass.",5
2016-08-17,oba,This is not a one-off.,2
2016-08-17,oba,This is not a photo op issue.,3
2016-08-17,oba,"This is, how do you make sure that a month from now, three months from now, six months from now, people still are getting the help that they need.",6
2016-08-17,oba,I need all Americans to stay focused on this.,4
2016-08-17,oba,"If you’re watching this today, make sure that you find out how you can help.",4
2016-08-17,oba,"You can go to VolunteerLouisiana.gov, or you can go to FEMA.gov.",3
2016-08-17,oba,"We’ll tell you, we’ll direct you -- you can go to WhiteHouse.gov, and we’ll direct you how you can help.",4
2016-08-17,oba,"But we’re going to need to stay on this, because these are some good people down here.",4
2016-08-17,oba,"We’re glad that the families I had a chance to meet are safe, but they’ve got a lot of work to do, and they shouldn’t have to do it alone.",7
2016-08-17,oba,All right?,1
2016-08-17,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2016-08-17,oba,God bless.,1
2016-08-17,oba,"Question:  With the damage you’ve seen, what more help may they need from Congress in terms of emergency spending?",6
2016-08-17,oba,"President Obama:  You know, we discussed that on the way down here.",4
2016-08-17,oba,What you have is the Stafford Act provides a certain match.,3
2016-08-17,oba,"A lot of the homes have flood insurance, but a lot of homes don’t.",4
2016-08-17,oba,"And what Craig Fugate is doing, what I instructed him to do from the start, is let’s get money out as fast as we can.",5
2016-08-17,oba,"Because we know that there’s going to be a certain amount of assistance that’s going to be forthcoming, so there’s no point in waiting.",7
2016-08-17,oba,We kind of make initial estimates and we start pushing stuff out.,3
2016-08-17,oba,That helps us and helps the Governor and all these officials here do their jobs.,4
2016-08-17,oba,"And then what we have to do is, as we fine-tune exactly what’s needed -- when we know, for example, how much permanent housing is going to have to be built, when we have a better sense of how much infrastructure has been damaged, what more we need to do in terms of mitigation strategies -- that’s when Congress I think may be called upon to do some more.",9
2016-08-17,oba,"Now, the good news is, is that you’ve got four members of Congress right here, and a number of them happen to be in the majority, so I suspect that they may be able to talk to the Speaker and talk to Mitch McConnell.",8
2016-08-17,oba,"But in part because of the fine stewardship at FEMA and, frankly, because we’ve been a little lucky so far -- and I’m going to knock on some wood -- in terms of the amount of money that’s gone out this year, FEMA has enough money for now to cover the costs that can be absorbed.",8
2016-08-17,oba,The issue is going to be less what we need to do in terms of paying for the short term; it’s going to be the medium-term and the long-term rebuilding.,11
2016-08-17,oba,Congress should be back in session right after Labor Day.,3
2016-08-17,oba,By that time we’ll probably have a better assessment.,3
2016-08-17,oba,"And in the meantime, lawyers at FEMA will be examining what statutory flexibility we’ve got.",3
2016-08-17,oba,And I know the Governor has been right on top of making sure that Louisiana gets everything that it can get in order to help rebuild.,13
2016-08-17,oba,"Question:  Mr. President, do you worry about that process becoming politicized and the trip here becoming politicized?",4
2016-08-17,oba,"President Obama:  No, I don’t.",3
2016-08-17,oba,"First of all, one of the benefits of being five months short of leaving here is I don’t worry too much about politics.",9
2016-08-17,oba,"The second thing I have seen, historically, is that when disasters strike, that’s probably one of the few times where Washington tends not to get political.",7
2016-08-17,oba,"I guarantee you nobody on this block, none of those first responders, nobody gives a hoot whether you’re Democrat or Republican.",5
2016-08-17,oba,"What they care about is making sure they’re getting the drywall out and the carpet out, and there’s not any mold building, and they get some contractors in here and they start rebuilding as quick as possible.",7
2016-08-17,oba,That’s what they care about.,3
2016-08-17,oba,That’s what I care about.,3
2016-08-17,oba,So we want to make sure that we do it right.,4
2016-08-17,oba,We want to make sure that we do it systematically.,4
2016-08-17,oba,But the one thing I just want to repeat is how proud I am of FEMA.,4
2016-08-17,oba,"Because if you think about the number of significant natural disasters that have occurred since my presidency began, you’d be hard-pressed to find a local official anywhere in the country, including those in the other party, who wouldn’t say that Craig Fugate and his team have been anything less than exemplary and professional.",12
2016-08-17,oba,"And one of the things I did when I walked through each of these homes was ask, have you contacted FEMA?",10
2016-08-17,oba,Have you filed?,1
2016-08-17,oba,And uniformly they said that they had been in touch with FEMA; they had acted professionally; some of them had already been out here for inspections.,7
2016-08-17,oba,"And I think that does indicate why it’s important for us to take the federal government seriously, federal workers seriously.",5
2016-08-17,oba,There’s a tendency sometimes for us to bash them and to think that they’re these faceless bureaucrats.,5
2016-08-17,oba,"But when you get into trouble, you want somebody who knows what they’re doing who’s on the ground working with outstanding officials.",7
2016-08-17,oba,And that’s true whatever party.,2
2016-08-17,oba,And I could not be prouder of the work that FEMA has done.,5
2016-08-17,oba,"That doesn’t mean that there aren’t going to still be folks who need more help, and that we’re not going to have some constraints statutorily, and Congress isn’t going to have to step up.",6
2016-08-17,oba,"But it does mean that the basic backbone, the basic infrastructure and architecture that we have in terms of disaster response I think has been high quality.",9
2016-08-17,oba,And I’m very proud of them for that.,3
2016-08-17,oba,And I want to publicly acknowledge that at the moment.,4
2016-08-17,oba,"Thank you, guys.",1
2016-09-05,oba," Good evening, everybody.",2
2016-09-05,oba,Let me begin by thanking President Xi and the people of Hangzhou and China for the hospitality in hosting this G20 summit on the shores of beautiful West Lake.,15
2016-09-05,oba,Thank you so much.,2
2016-09-05,oba,Xie xie.,1
2016-09-05,oba,This visit offered the eighth opportunity for President Xi and me to meet.,4
2016-09-05,oba,"We agreed to advance our cooperation across a range of issues, including climate change, global health and development, peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, and nuclear security.",12
2016-09-05,oba,"We also addressed our differences on issues like religious freedom, maritime security, and a level economic playing field, but we did so in a clear, candid, direct, and I think constructive way.",8
2016-09-05,oba,"That has helped us to manage problems, and it’s consistently helped us to improve relations between the United States and China.",6
2016-09-05,oba,This has also been my tenth and final G20 meeting.,3
2016-09-05,oba,It goes by fast.,2
2016-09-05,oba,"And so before I take your questions, let me put into context what we’ve done over the course of our G20 meetings.",7
2016-09-05,oba,"And I think back to April 2009, when hundreds of thousands of Americans were losing their jobs and their homes and their savings each month, and unemployment was on its way to 10 percent.",8
2016-09-05,oba,"Around the world, for the first time in a generation, the global economy was contracting, trade was shrinking, and the international financial system was nearly frozen.",6
2016-09-05,oba,"By several key measures, the global economy was on a worse trajectory than it was at the outset of the Great Depression.",6
2016-09-05,oba,But the size and the scope of the crisis was not what made that London G20 historic.,5
2016-09-05,oba,What made it historic was the speed and magnitude of our collective response.,5
2016-09-05,oba,"One nation couldn’t solve the problem alone, so together, developed and developing nations alike, took a comprehensive and unprecedented set of actions to prevent another depression and set the stage for recovery.",7
2016-09-05,oba,Most important was to create jobs and growth by stimulating demand across our economies.,7
2016-09-05,oba,And America led the way.,2
2016-09-05,oba,"By then, in just my first 10 or so weeks as President, we had already passed the Recovery Act, set in motion plans to rescue our auto industry, stabilize our banks, jumpstart loans to small businesses, and launch programs to help homeowners refinance and stay in their homes.",7
2016-09-05,oba,And our G20 partners would follow with similar actions.,3
2016-09-05,oba,"To stabilize the global economy, we rejected the protectionism that could deepen the crisis.",4
2016-09-05,oba,"We cooperated to keep markets open and trade finance flowing, and bolstered the international finance system’s lending capacity to respond to countries that were hurting the most.",8
2016-09-05,oba,"And to prevent future crises, we took steps to reform our financial regulatory system -- including the historic Wall Street Reform that we passed more than six years ago.",7
2016-09-05,oba,These were the actions we took in 2009.,4
2016-09-05,oba,"They were actions that prevented another depression, and created conditions for the global economy to grow by more than 25 percent over the past seven years.",9
2016-09-05,oba,"What we also did, though, was to elevate the G20 to become the world’s premier forum for international economic cooperation.",6
2016-09-05,oba,"And that decision allowed us, as the global recovery progressed, to take further actions to strengthen the global economy.",5
2016-09-05,oba,And that’s what we came to Hangzhou to do.,3
2016-09-05,oba,We’ve had long debates over the years about the best ways to promote sustained growth.,5
2016-09-05,oba,"But America’s voice in the G20 has always been one of bold action, and that stance has been backed up by our economic performance.",4
2016-09-05,oba,"Since job growth turned positive in early 2010, America’s businesses have created more than 15 million new jobs.",4
2016-09-05,oba,We’ve cut the unemployment rate in half.,2
2016-09-05,oba,"And so far this year, wages have risen by almost 3 percent, which is much faster than the pace of inflation.",8
2016-09-05,oba,But one of the things that we learned through the G20 process is that more than ever our economies are interconnected and we’ve got more work to do together to keep the global economy growing.,8
2016-09-05,oba,We have to do more to grow wages faster; to shrink inequality faster; to give everybody a shot at opportunity and security in a changing economy.,6
2016-09-05,oba,And that should be the way forward for the G20 -- to make sure that the benefits of trends like globalization and technological progress are shared broadly by more workers and families who still feel like the global economy is not working for them.,10
2016-09-05,oba,And that’s what we did here at this G20 Summit.,4
2016-09-05,oba,"We committed to using all of our policy tools to promote robust, inclusive growth that creates opportunity for young people and the middle class that they’re working to join.",11
2016-09-05,oba,We focused on making sure that businesses can compete fairly and all working families can take advantage of the new prospects the digital economy creates.,10
2016-09-05,oba,And we reaffirmed our commitment to support emerging economies through an array of development initiatives.,7
2016-09-05,oba,We also discussed ways to unlock the mutual benefits that trade provides while keeping it fair for our workers and the playing field level for our businesses.,11
2016-09-05,oba,"And that includes high-standard trade agreements that actually benefit the middle class, like the TPP.",4
2016-09-05,oba,"That includes working together to abstain from unfair currency practices, and address corruption and global tax evasion.",6
2016-09-05,oba,And it includes our agreement to establish a new forum to address some of the market-distorting policies in the global steel sector that have hurt workers and businesses.,11
2016-09-05,oba,We also added momentum to the fight to protect our planet for future generations.,4
2016-09-05,oba,"On Saturday, the U.S. and China formally entered the Paris Agreement.",2
2016-09-05,oba,"And today, the G20 welcomed efforts to enter the Paris Agreement into force by the end of this year.",7
2016-09-05,oba,"So if there’s anything that the past eight years have taught us, it’s that the complicated challenges of the 21st century cannot be met without coordinated and collective action.",5
2016-09-05,oba,Agreement is not always easy and results do not always come quickly.,2
2016-09-05,oba,Respecting different points of view; forging consensus instead of dictating terms -- that can sometimes be frustrating.,4
2016-09-05,oba,But it is how progress has been won and how it will be won in the future.,5
2016-09-05,oba,It’s how we’ve come as far as we have in the eight years since the crisis affected us all.,3
2016-09-05,oba,And it’s how the G20 can make progress for all people in the years to come.,4
2016-09-05,oba,"So, with that, let me take some questions.",3
2016-09-05,oba,And I will start with Roberta Rampton of Reuters.,4
2016-11-09,oba,"Good afternoon, everybody.",2
2016-11-09,oba,"Yesterday, before votes were tallied, I shot a video that some of you may have seen in which I said to the American people, regardless of which side you were on in the election, regardless of whether your candidate won or lost, the sun would come up in the morning.",10
2016-11-09,oba,And that is one bit of prognosticating that actually came true.,3
2016-11-09,oba,The sun is up.,2
2016-11-09,oba,And I know everybody had a long night.,3
2016-11-09,oba,I did as well.,2
2016-11-09,oba,"I had a chance to talk to President-elect Trump last night about 3:30 in the morning, I think it was, to congratulate him on winning the election.",8
2016-11-09,oba,And I had a chance to invite him to come to the White House tomorrow to talk about making sure that there is a successful transition between our presidencies.,12
2016-11-09,oba,"Now, it is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences.",5
2016-11-09,oba,"But remember, eight years ago President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences.",4
2016-11-09,oba,But President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so that we could hit the ground running.,8
2016-11-09,oba,And one thing you realize quickly in this job is that the presidency and the vice presidency is bigger than any of us.,6
2016-11-09,oba,"So I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago, and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the President-elect -- because we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country.",11
2016-11-09,oba,The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy.,6
2016-11-09,oba,"And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.",4
2016-11-09,oba,I also had a chance last night to speak with Secretary Clinton and I just had a chance to hear her remarks.,5
2016-11-09,oba,I could not be prouder of her.,3
2016-11-09,oba,She has lived an extraordinary life of public service.,4
2016-11-09,oba,She was a great First Lady.,2
2016-11-09,oba,She was an outstanding senator for the state of New York.,6
2016-11-09,oba,And she could not have been a better secretary of state.,3
2016-11-09,oba,I'm proud of her.,3
2016-11-09,oba,A lot of Americans look up to her.,3
2016-11-09,oba,Her candidacy and nomination was historic and sends a message to our daughters all across the country that they can achieve at the highest levels of politics.,6
2016-11-09,oba,And I'm absolutely confident that she and President Clinton will continue to do great work for people here in the United States and all around the world.,7
2016-11-09,oba,"Now, everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team.",7
2016-11-09,oba,"This is an ""intramural scrimmage.""",2
2016-11-09,oba,We're not Democrats first.,1
2016-11-09,oba,We're not Republicans first.,1
2016-11-09,oba,We are Americans first.,1
2016-11-09,oba,We're patriots first.,1
2016-11-09,oba,We all what -- want what's best for this country.,4
2016-11-09,oba,That's what I heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night.,5
2016-11-09,oba,That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly.,4
2016-11-09,oba,And I was heartened by that.,2
2016-11-09,oba,"That's what the country needs -- a sense of unity, a sense of inclusion, a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law, and a respect for each other.",10
2016-11-09,oba,I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition.,4
2016-11-09,oba,And I certainly hope that's how his presidency has a chance to begin.,5
2016-11-09,oba,"I also told my team today to keep their heads up, because the remarkable work that they have done, day in, day out, often without a lot of fanfare, often with a lot of -- a lot of attention -- work in agencies, work in obscure areas of policy that make government run better, and make it more responsive, and make it more efficient, and make it more service-friendly so that it's actually helping more people.",10
2016-11-09,oba,"That remarkable work has left the next President with a stronger, better country than the one that existed eight years ago.",8
2016-11-09,oba,"So win or lose in this election, that was always our mission.",5
2016-11-09,oba,That was our mission from day one.,4
2016-11-09,oba,"And everyone on my team should be extraordinarily proud of everything that they have done; and so should all the Americans that I've had a chance to meet all across this country who do the hard work of building on that progress every single day: teachers in schools, doctors in E.R.",11
2016-11-09,oba,"clinic, small businesses putting their all into starting something up, making sure they're treating their employees well, all the important work that's done by moms and dads and families and congregations in every state, the work of perfecting this union.",7
2016-11-09,oba,So this was a long and hard fought campaign.,3
2016-11-09,oba,"A lot of our fellow Americans are exalted today; a lot of Americans are less so, but that's the nature of campaigns.",5
2016-11-09,oba,That's the nature of democracy.,3
2016-11-09,oba,It is hard and sometimes contentious and noisy and it's not always inspiring.,3
2016-11-09,oba,"But to the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know, you have to stay encouraged.",8
2016-11-09,oba,Don't get cynical.,1
2016-11-09,oba,Don't ever think you can't make a difference.,3
2016-11-09,oba,"As Secretary Clinton said this morning, fighting for what is right is worth it.",4
2016-11-09,oba,Sometimes you lose an argument; sometimes you lose an election.,3
2016-11-09,oba,"You know, the path that this country has taken has never been a straight line.",4
2016-11-09,oba,"We zig and zag and sometimes, you know, we move in ways that some people think is forward and others think is moving back, and that's okay.",5
2016-11-09,oba,I've lost elections before.,1
2016-11-09,oba,"Joe hasn't, but, you know -- So I've been -- I've been sort of sharing --

That's the way politics works sometimes.",2
2016-11-09,oba,We -- We try really hard to persuade people that we're right and then people vote.,3
2016-11-09,oba,"And then if we lose, we learn from our mistakes.",3
2016-11-09,oba,We do some reflection.,2
2016-11-09,oba,We lick our wounds.,2
2016-11-09,oba,We brush ourselves off.,1
2016-11-09,oba,We get back in the arena.,4
2016-11-09,oba,We go at it.,2
2016-11-09,oba,We try even harder the next time.,2
2016-11-09,oba,"The point, though, is is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens, because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy.",9
2016-11-09,oba,That's how this country has moved forward for 240 years.,4
2016-11-09,oba,It's how we've pushed boundaries and promoted freedom around the world.,6
2016-11-09,oba,That's how we've expanded the rights of our founding to reach all of our citizens.,6
2016-11-09,oba,It's how we have come this far.,2
2016-11-09,oba,"And that's why I'm confident that this incredible journey that we're on, as Americans, will go on.",7
2016-11-09,oba,And I'm looking forward to doing everything that I can to make sure that the next President is successful in that.,8
2016-11-09,oba,"I've said before, I think of this job as being a relay runner.",4
2016-11-09,oba,You take the baton.,2
2016-11-09,oba,You run your best race.,2
2016-11-09,oba,"And hopefully by the time you hand it off, you're a little further ahead; you've made a little progress.",5
2016-11-09,oba,"And I can say that we've done that, and I want to make sure that handoff is well executed because ultimately we're all on the same team.",5
2016-11-09,oba,All right?,1
2016-11-09,oba,"Thank you very much, everybody.",2
2017-01-11,oba,"My fellow Americans:

Michelle and I have been so touched by all the well-wishes that we’ve received over the past few weeks.",6
2017-01-11,oba,But tonight -- tonight it’s my turn to say thanks.,2
2017-01-11,oba,"Whether we have seen eye-to-eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people -- in living rooms and in schools; at farms, on factory floors; at diners and on distant military outposts -- those conversations are what have kept me honest, and kept me inspired, and kept me going.",6
2017-01-11,oba,"And every day, I have learned from you.",2
2017-01-11,oba,"You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.",3
2017-01-11,oba,So I first came to Chicago when I was in my early 20s.,4
2017-01-11,oba,"And I was still trying to figure out who I was, still searching for a purpose to my life.",7
2017-01-11,oba,And it was the neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills.,9
2017-01-11,oba,"It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.",8
2017-01-11,oba,"Now, this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, and they get engaged, and they come together to demand it.",5
2017-01-11,oba,"After eight years as your President, I still believe that.",5
2017-01-11,oba,And it’s not just my belief.,2
2017-01-11,oba,It’s the beating heart of our American idea -- our bold experiment in self-government.,5
2017-01-11,oba,"It’s the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.",8
2017-01-11,oba,"It’s the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing; that we, the people, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect union.",7
2017-01-11,oba,"What a radical idea, the great gift that our Founders gave to us: the freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat, and toil, and imagination -- and the imperative to strive together as well, to achieve a common good, a greater good.",5
2017-01-11,oba,"For 240 years, our nation’s call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation.",3
2017-01-11,oba,"It’s what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom.",5
2017-01-11,oba,It’s what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the Rio Grande.,5
2017-01-11,oba,It's what pushed women to reach for the ballot.,5
2017-01-11,oba,It's what powered workers to organize.,3
2017-01-11,oba,It’s why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima; Iraq and Afghanistan -- and why men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well.,6
2017-01-11,oba,So -- So that’s what we mean when we say America is exceptional.,1
2017-01-11,oba,"Not that our nation's been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change, and make life better for those who follow.",6
2017-01-11,oba,"Yes, our progress has been uneven.",2
2017-01-11,oba,The work of democracy has always been hard; it's always been contentious.,4
2017-01-11,oba,Sometimes it's been bloody.,1
2017-01-11,oba,"For every two steps forward, it often feels that we take one step back.",3
2017-01-11,oba,"But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some.",6
2017-01-11,oba,"If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history, if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran’s nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9/11, if I had told you that we would win marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens -- if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high.",17
2017-01-11,oba,But that’s what we did.,2
2017-01-11,oba,That’s what you did.,2
2017-01-11,oba,You were the change.,2
2017-01-11,oba,"You answered people’s hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.",6
2017-01-11,oba,"In 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy --

The peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected President to the next.",6
2017-01-11,oba,"I committed to President-elect Trump that my Administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.",4
2017-01-11,oba,Because it’s up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face.,7
2017-01-11,oba,We have what we need to do so.,3
2017-01-11,oba,We have everything we need to meet those challenges.,5
2017-01-11,oba,"After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on Earth.",5
2017-01-11,oba,"Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours.",7
2017-01-11,oba,"But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works; only if our politics better reflects the decency of the our people; only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.",6
2017-01-11,oba,That’s what I want to focus on tonight: the state of our democracy.,5
2017-01-11,oba,"Understand, democracy does not require uniformity.",1
2017-01-11,oba,"Our Founders argued, they quarreled, eventually they compromised.",3
2017-01-11,oba,They expected us to do the same.,3
2017-01-11,oba,"But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity -- the idea that for all our outward differences, we're all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.",8
2017-01-11,oba,There have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity.,4
2017-01-11,oba,"And the beginning of this century has been one of those times: a shrinking world, growing inequality, demographic change, and the specter of terrorism.",7
2017-01-11,oba,"These forces haven’t just tested our security and our prosperity, but are testing our democracy as well.",3
2017-01-11,oba,"And how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids, and create good jobs, and protect our homeland.",4
2017-01-11,oba,"In other words, it will determine our future.",3
2017-01-11,oba,"To begin with, our democracy won’t work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity.",5
2017-01-11,oba,"And the good news is that today the economy is growing again; wages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are all rising again; poverty is falling again.",7

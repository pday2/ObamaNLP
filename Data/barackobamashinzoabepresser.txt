Well, I want to thank Prime Minister Abe and the people of Japan for welcoming us.  Prime Minister Abe and his team have done an outstanding job preparing for the G7 Summit.  And we discussed, as Shinzo indicated, the need for us to continue to boost global growth and to move ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The alliance between the United States and Japan is a critical foundation for the security of both of our countries.  That alliance has also helped to fortify peace and security throughout the region. As Prime Minister Abe indicated, we did discuss the tragedy that took place in Okinawa, and I extended my sincerest condolences and deepest regrets.  And the United States will continue to cooperate fully with the investigation to ensure that justice is done under the Japanese legal system. We also discussed a range of regional issues, and given the threat from North Korea, we agreed to continue reinforcing deterrents and strengthening our defense capabilities. On maritime issues, we are united in upholding freedom of navigation and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We also discussed a range of global issues, including the need for additional resources to help migrants and refugees, and to support Iraq.  And we discussed the role our countries should play in achieving the early entry into force of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Finally, I’m looking forward to the opportunity to visit with some of our American and Japanese military personnel to thank them for their service. And our visit to Hiroshima will honor all those who were lost in World War II and reaffirm our shared vision of a world without nuclear weapons, as well as highlight the extraordinary alliance that we have been able to forge over these many decades.

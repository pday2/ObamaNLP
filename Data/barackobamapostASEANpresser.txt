Good afternoon, everybody.  Once again, I want to thank the government and the people of Laos for their wonderful hospitality and for their leadership as host of the ASEAN and East Asia Summits.  And I especially want to express my gratitude for the warmth and the kindness that they’ve shown to me as the first U.S. President to visit this nation.  It has been a memorable and, at times, a very moving visit. We’re here because, as a region with more than 600 million people, several fast-growing economies, some vibrant democracies, but also countries transitioning to democracies, and given their strategic location along vital trade routes, the 10 nations of ASEAN are critical to peace and prosperity not only in the Asia Pacific but to the world.  Indeed, the United States and ASEAN are among each other’s top trading partners.  We’re the largest investors in this region, and ASEAN is one of our largest markets for U.S. exports, supporting hundreds of thousands of American jobs.  So our trade and investment fuels jobs and prosperity across our countries. And that’s why, as part of my rebalance of American foreign policy to the Asia Pacific, I’ve deepened our engagement with the nations of Southeast Asia and with ASEAN as an institution.  As the first U.S. President to meet with the leaders of all 10 ASEAN countries, I’ve sustained our cooperation throughout my presidency.  Earlier this year, I was proud to host the first U.S.-ASEAN Summit in the United States, at Sunnylands, California.  Our meeting here in Laos was our eighth meeting.  And this visit marks my ninth to the ASEAN region -- more than any U.S. President. Together, the United States and ASEAN have forged a strategic partnership guided by key principles, including that ASEAN will remain central to peace, prosperity and progress in the Asia Pacific.  The United States is now firmly part of the East Asia Summit, and we have worked to make that organization the region’s leading forum for dealing with political and security challenges, including maritime security.  And we’re guided by the shared vision of the region that we put forward at Sunnylands -- open, dynamic and competitive economies; mutual security and the peaceful resolution of disputes; and respect for human rights -- in short, a region where all nations play by the same rules.  That’s a vision that we advanced here. We’re stepping up our efforts to increase trade and investment.  As part of the initiative I announced earlier this year -- U.S.-ASEAN Connect -- we’re doing more to connect our businesses and investors so that it is easier to start new ventures together.  More to connect our entrepreneurs so we’re encouraging innovation in what are increasingly digital economies.  More to connect clean energy projects as we pursue a low-carbon future.  All of which will also reinforce this region’s continued economic integration through the ASEAN Community.  And given that four ASEAN nations are also part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, I reiterated that I am determined to do everything I can to encourage the U.S. Congress to approve TPP before I leave office. With regard to security, our nations reaffirmed our commitment to a regional order where international rules and norms are upheld and where disagreements are resolved peacefully. There was recognition of the importance of the international arbitration ruling in July, which is legal and binding, and which clarified maritime claims by the Philippines and China in the South China Sea.  We discussed the importance of claimants adhering to steps to which they've already agreed, including respecting international law, not militarizing disputed areas and not occupying uninhabited islands, reefs and shoals.  And I reiterated that the United States will stand with allies and partners in upholding fundamental interests, among them the freedom of navigation and overflight, lawful commerce that is not impeded, and peaceful resolution of disputes. The United States and ASEAN also continue to deepen our cooperation on transnational challenges.  We discussed the importance of continuing to share information to prevent terrorism and the flow of foreign fighters.  Given the threat of climate change to all our nations -- especially countries in this region -- we agreed on the importance of bringing the Paris agreement into force as soon as possible.  We agreed to cooperation in the fight against human trafficking, including sharing more information on smugglers, closer law enforcement cooperation and more support for victims. And at the East Asia Summit, our 18 nations expressed our grave concern about North Korea’s provocative missile launches, highlighted the threat posed by its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and called on North Korea to uphold its international obligations. And, finally, I’m especially pleased that we continue to deepen the connections between the people of ASEAN and America -- particularly our young people, like the inspiring young men and women that I met with at our town hall yesterday.  Our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative is now more than 100,000 strong.  The women’s leadership academy that I announced yesterday will support women leaders in business, government and civil society throughout ASEAN.  And we’re going to help increase language skills among students and teachers through our English for All program. In closing, I’m mindful that this is the last day of my last trip to this region as President.  And when I think back to the time that I spent here as a boy, I can’t help but be struck by the extraordinary progress that’s been made across so much of the region in the decades since -- even as there’s still a lot of work to be done.  And so it means a great deal to me, not only as President, but also personally, that over the past eight years we’ve increased cooperation between ASEAN countries and the United States.  It is unprecedented the breadth and depth of our relationships.  And I think it’s one of the most successful parts of our rebalance policy. We’ve made it clear that the United States will continue to stand with the people of this region in advancing their security, prosperity and dignity, including universal human rights.  And I am very optimistic that the ties of friendship between our people -- as reflected by that roomful of young people that we saw yesterday -- will bring us even closer in the years to come.

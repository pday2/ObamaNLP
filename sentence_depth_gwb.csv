2008-06-03,gwb,These challenges are not all of government's making.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.,7

2008-06-03,gwb,"This moment – this election – is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.",5

2008-06-03,gwb,I just think he doesn't know.,2
2008-06-03,gwb,Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year?,6
2008-06-03,gwb,How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?,7

2008-06-03,gwb,It's not because John McCain doesn't care.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,It's because John McCain doesn't get it.,3

2008-06-03,gwb,It's time for us to change America.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,"You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.,7
2008-06-03,gwb,"We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President – when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.",12
2008-06-03,gwb,"We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job – an economy that honors the dignity of work.",17

2008-06-03,gwb,"In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.",9
2008-06-03,gwb,"When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.",8
2008-06-03,gwb,She's the one who taught me about hard work.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life.,7
2008-06-03,gwb,She poured everything she had into me.,4
2008-06-03,gwb,"And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.",5

2008-06-03,gwb,These are my heroes.,2
2008-06-03,gwb,Theirs are the stories that shaped me.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.,9
2008-06-03,gwb,What is that promise?,2
2008-06-03,gwb,"It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.",9
2008-06-03,gwb,"It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.",8
2008-06-03,gwb,"Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves – protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"Our government should work for us, not against us.",2
2008-06-03,gwb,"It should help us, not hurt us.",2
2008-06-03,gwb,"It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"That's the promise of America – the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.",8
2008-06-03,gwb,That's the promise we need to keep.,4
2008-06-03,gwb,That's the change we need right now.,4
2008-06-03,gwb,So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.,4
2008-06-03,gwb,"Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,"Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.",8
2008-06-03,gwb,"I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,I will cut taxes – cut taxes – for 95% of all working families.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,"Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.",4
2008-06-03,gwb,"And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.",10
2008-06-03,gwb,"Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,"In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,"And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,"Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.",6
2008-06-03,gwb,Not even close.,1

2008-06-03,gwb,"I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.,4
2008-06-03,gwb,"And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy – wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"America, now is not the time for small plans.",4
2008-06-03,gwb,"Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.,4
2008-06-03,gwb,And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,I'll invest in early childhood education.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,"I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support.",4
2008-06-03,gwb,"And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.",4
2008-06-03,gwb,"And we will keep our promise to every young American – if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.",8
2008-06-03,gwb,"If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.",3
2008-06-03,gwb,"If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.",9
2008-06-03,gwb,"Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.",6
2008-06-03,gwb,"And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.",6
2008-06-03,gwb,"Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime – by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.",9
2008-06-03,gwb,"But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less – because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,"It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our ""intellectual and moral strength.""",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,"Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.",10
2008-06-03,gwb,But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.,7
2008-06-03,gwb,Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility – that's the essence of America's promise.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,"And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"When John McCain said we could just ""muddle through"" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell – but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.,6
2008-06-03,gwb,"And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.",6
2008-06-03,gwb,That's not the judgment we need.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,That won't keep America safe.,1
2008-06-03,gwb,"We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,"If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice – but it is not the change we need.",6
2008-06-03,gwb,We are the party of Roosevelt.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,We are the party of Kennedy.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe.,2
2008-06-03,gwb,"The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans – have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,"As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.",12
2008-06-03,gwb,"I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,"But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.",7
2008-06-03,gwb,I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease.,7
2008-06-03,gwb,"And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.",14
2008-06-03,gwb,These are the policies I will pursue.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,"And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.,6
2008-06-03,gwb,Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.,8
2008-06-03,gwb,"The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.",4
2008-06-03,gwb,So let us agree that patriotism has no party.,4
2008-06-03,gwb,"I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain.",4
2008-06-03,gwb,"The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,They have not served a Red America or a Blue America – they have served the United States of America.,4
2008-06-03,gwb,"So I've got news for you, John McCain.",4
2008-06-03,gwb,We all put our country first.,2
2008-06-03,gwb,"America, our work will not be easy.",2
2008-06-03,gwb,"The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.",6
2008-06-03,gwb,For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.,6
2008-06-03,gwb,What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose – our sense of higher purpose.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,And that's what we have to restore.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,"We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.",9
2008-06-03,gwb,"The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.",8
2008-06-03,gwb,"I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.",8
2008-06-03,gwb,"Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.",8
2008-06-03,gwb,This too is part of America's promise – the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.,12
2008-06-03,gwb,I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.,6
2008-06-03,gwb,"They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.",6
2008-06-03,gwb,And that's to be expected.,2
2008-06-03,gwb,"Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.",3
2008-06-03,gwb,"If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.",4
2008-06-03,gwb,You make a big election about small things.,4
2008-06-03,gwb,And you know what – it's worked before.,2
2008-06-03,gwb,Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,"When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty.",2
2008-06-03,gwb,"If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.",4
2008-06-03,gwb,I get it.,1
2008-06-03,gwb,I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.,5
2008-06-03,gwb,"I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.",5
2008-06-03,gwb,But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me.,3
2008-06-03,gwb,It's been about you.,2

2006-01-31,gwb,We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes.,4
2006-01-31,gwb,We must ensure that lower income Americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement.,7
2006-01-31,gwb,We must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement.,7

2006-01-31,gwb,"As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers.",6
2006-01-31,gwb,And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts.,4
2006-01-31,gwb,Here is how the idea works.,3

2006-01-31,gwb,We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once but rather paid out over time as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits.,9
2006-01-31,gwb,"And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.",11
2006-01-31,gwb,"Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to Federal employees, because you already have something similar called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based investment funds.",12
2006-01-31,gwb,It's time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young Americans.,5

2008-01-28,gwb,"The people's trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks, special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,"Unfortunately, neither goal was met.",2
2008-01-28,gwb,"So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I'll send it back to you with my veto.",8
2008-01-28,gwb,And tomorrow I will issue an Executive order that directs Federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,"If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote.",3
2008-01-28,gwb,Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,"On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"My administration brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,And Congress can help even more.,2
2008-01-28,gwb,"Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow State housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,"The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not Government control.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,So I have proposed ending the bias in the Tax Code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,"This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create association health plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"With all these steps, we will ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor's office, not in the Halls of Congress.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"On education, we must trust students to learn, if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams, and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"Six years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today, no one can deny its results.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record.",3
2008-01-28,gwb,Reading scores are on the rise.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,African American and Hispanic students posted alltime highs.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,"Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibilities for States and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"Members of Congress, the No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"It is succeeding, and we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"Thanks to the DC Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation's Capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other nonpublic school.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's inner cities.",8
2008-01-28,gwb,So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,"And to open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,We have seen how Pell grants help low-income college students realize their full potential.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"Together, we've expanded the size and reach of these grants.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,Now let us apply the same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools.,8
2008-01-28,gwb,"On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,"Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,So we're working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,"We're working for a successful Doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"At the same time, we're pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,"Many products from these nations now enter America duty free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,These agreements will level the playing field.,2
2008-01-28,gwb,They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,"They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world, those whose products say ""Made in the U.S.A."" These agreements also promote America's strategic interests.",9
2008-01-28,gwb,"The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers.",9
2008-01-28,gwb,"If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,Trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the Federal Government has a responsibility to help.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,"To build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"Together, we should take the next steps.",2
2008-01-28,gwb,Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,"Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and China make a greater use of clean energy sources.",8
2008-01-28,gwb,"And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases.",11
2008-01-28,gwb,This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy efficient technology.,9
2008-01-28,gwb,"To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"Last year, Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,So I ask Congress to double Federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,"On matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life.,9
2008-01-28,gwb,So we're expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,"And as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices, such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life.",12
2008-01-28,gwb,"On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,"I've submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel.",8
2008-01-28,gwb,Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"In communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"Over the past 7 years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,Americans have volunteered in record numbers.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,Charitable donations are higher than ever.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,"Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the Federal Government.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"And to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for Federal funds, I ask you to permanently extend charitable choice.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,"And tonight I'm pleased to announce that in April, we will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans.",9
2008-01-28,gwb,There are two other pressing challenges that I've raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,"Every Member in this Chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"We all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,I've laid out proposals to reform these programs.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,Now I ask Members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren.,10
2008-01-28,gwb,The other pressing challenge is immigration.,2
2008-01-28,gwb,"America needs to secure our borders, and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"We're increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"We've effectively ended the policy of catch-and-release at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy.,8
2008-01-28,gwb,This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,"Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved.",2
2008-01-28,gwb,And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,This is the business of our Nation here at home.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,Yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.,9
2008-01-28,gwb,"Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"In the last 7 years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,We've seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,We've seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,We've seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new President and a new parliament.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,We've seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,These images of liberty have inspired us.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,"In the past 7 years, we've also seen the images that have sobered us.",3
2008-01-28,gwb,We've watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's hand.,10
2008-01-28,gwb,"We've seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"On a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists, evil men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"Since 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists.",3
2008-01-28,gwb,"We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,"And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories.",11
2008-01-28,gwb,"And that is why, for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,"Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for Al Qaida is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope.",11
2008-01-28,gwb,"These successes must continue, so we're adding 3,200 marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police.",8
2008-01-28,gwb,"Defeating the Taliban and Al Qaida is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting America's vital mission in Afghanistan.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,"In Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,So we reviewed our strategy and changed course.,2
2008-01-28,gwb,We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"We gave our troops a new mission: work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country.",9
2008-01-28,gwb,The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,"They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,"And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life.",8
2008-01-28,gwb,"Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole Nation.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,The Iraqis launched a surge of their own.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of Al Qaida's brutality, started a popular uprising called the Anbar Awakening.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"Over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country.",3
2008-01-28,gwb,"And today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"The Government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well, adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just 1 year ago.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,"When we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"A year later, high-profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"When we met last year, militia extremists—some armed and trained by Iran— were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,"When we met last year, Al Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"Today, it is Al Qaida that is searching for safe passage.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,"And over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key Al Qaida leaders and operatives.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"Last month, Usama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on Al Qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"Al Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise.",3
2008-01-28,gwb,"Today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of return on success, and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders.,7
2008-01-28,gwb,This evening I want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"Soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we've asked of you and more.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,Our Nation is grateful for your courage.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,We are proud of your accomplishments.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"And tonight in this hallowed Chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our Nation.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops.,5
2008-01-28,gwb,Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,"They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead.",3
2008-01-28,gwb,Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy.,11
2008-01-28,gwb,"American troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with Iraqi forces and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit.",3
2008-01-28,gwb,"Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders.,6
2008-01-28,gwb,"General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in, quote, ""the disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, Al Qaida-Iraq regaining lost ground, and a marked increase in violence.""",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"Members of Congress, having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen.",4
2008-01-28,gwb,"In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they're making toward political reconciliation.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"At the local level, Sunnis, Shi'a, and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,Progress in the Provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,We're seeing some encouraging signs.,2
2008-01-28,gwb,The national Government is sharing oil revenues with the Provinces.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,The parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-Ba'athification reform.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,They're now debating a Provincial powers law.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,"The Iraqis still have a distance to travel, but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place, and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our Nation, but it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,A free Iraq will deny Al Qaida a safe haven.,2
2008-01-28,gwb,A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible.,4
2008-01-28,gwb,"A free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world.",8
2008-01-28,gwb,"By contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland.",10
2008-01-28,gwb,The enemy has made its intentions clear.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,"At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, Al Qaida's top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington.",5
2008-01-28,gwb,"My fellow Americans, we will not rest either.",2
2008-01-28,gwb,We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated.,3
2008-01-28,gwb,"We must do the difficult work today so that years from now, people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America.",8
2008-01-28,gwb,"We're also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have new cause for hope.",6
2008-01-28,gwb,Palestinians have elected a President who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel.,13
2008-01-28,gwb,"Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security.",7
2008-01-28,gwb,"This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year.",10
2008-01-28,gwb,The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side by side in peace.,6

2003-01-28,gwb,"Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.",7

2003-01-28,gwb,America's duty is familiar.,3
2003-01-28,gwb,"Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world.",5
2003-01-28,gwb,"In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit.",4
2003-01-28,gwb,"In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America.",7

2003-01-28,gwb,We now know that that regime was deceiving the world and developing those weapons all along.,4
2003-01-28,gwb,"And today, the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions.",3
2003-01-28,gwb,America and the world will not be blackmailed.,3
2003-01-28,gwb,"America is working with the countries of the region, South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, to find a peaceful solution and to show the North Korean Government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship.",8

2003-01-28,gwb,Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq.,5
2003-01-28,gwb,"A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.",6
2003-01-28,gwb,"Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost.",8
2003-01-28,gwb,"To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction.",6
2003-01-28,gwb,"For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement.",3
2003-01-28,gwb,"He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while inspectors were in his country.",4
2003-01-28,gwb,"Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons, not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities.",6
2003-01-28,gwb,"Almost 3 months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm.",4
2003-01-28,gwb,He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations and for the opinion of the world.,7
2003-01-28,gwb,The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct— were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California.,5
2003-01-28,gwb,The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming.,5
2003-01-28,gwb,"It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed.",5
2003-01-28,gwb,Nothing like this has happened.,3

2003-01-28,gwb,He's not accounted for these materials.,3

2003-01-28,gwb,These are designed to produce germ warfare agents and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors.,5
2003-01-28,gwb,Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities.,2

2003-01-28,gwb,"The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb.",7

2003-01-28,gwb,Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.,8
2003-01-28,gwb,Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities.,2
2003-01-28,gwb,He clearly has much to hide.,3
2003-01-28,gwb,The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.,3
2003-01-28,gwb,"To the contrary, he is deceiving.",3
2003-01-28,gwb,"From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves.",6

2003-01-28,gwb,"Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction.",8
2003-01-28,gwb,But why?,1
2003-01-28,gwb,"The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack.",6
2003-01-28,gwb,"With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region.",7
2003-01-28,gwb,And this Congress and the American people must recognize another threat.,3
2003-01-28,gwb,"Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaida.",7
2003-01-28,gwb,"Secretly and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own.",4
2003-01-28,gwb,"Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained.",4

2003-01-28,gwb,"If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late.",4
2003-01-28,gwb,"Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option.",6

2007-01-23,gwb,Unemployment is low; inflation is low; wages are rising.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,"This economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government but with more enterprise.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"Next week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,Tonight I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,"First, we must balance the Federal budget.",2
2007-01-23,gwb,We can do so without raising taxes.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,"What we need is spending discipline in Washington, DC.",3
2007-01-23,gwb,We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 and met that goal 3 years ahead of schedule.,5
2007-01-23,gwb,Now let us take the next step.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,"In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the Federal deficit within the next 5 years.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,I ask you to make the same commitment.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,"Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the Federal Government, and we can balance the Federal budget.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"Next, there is the matter of earmarks.",3
2007-01-23,gwb,"These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour, when not even C-SPAN is watching.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion.",3
2007-01-23,gwb,"Even worse, over 90 percent of the earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,They are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk.,10
2007-01-23,gwb,"You didn't vote them into law, I didn't sign them into law, yet they're treated as if they have the force of law.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,The time has come to end this practice.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,"So let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,"And finally, to keep this economy strong, we must take on the challenge of entitlements.",3
2007-01-23,gwb,"Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,Yet we're failing in that duty.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,"And this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,"Everyone in this Chamber knows this to be true, yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,So let us work together and do it now.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,"With enough good sense and good will, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid and save Social Security.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life.,6
2007-01-23,gwb,"Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding schools accountable for results.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"And because we acted, students are performing better in reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap.",3
2007-01-23,gwb,"Now the task is to build on the success without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform.",8
2007-01-23,gwb,We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better.,9
2007-01-23,gwb,We must increase funds for students who struggle and make sure these children get the special help they need.,10
2007-01-23,gwb,And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,"The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's children, and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,"When it comes to health care, Government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children, and we will meet those responsibilities.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,"For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy, and so tonight I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,"First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"Families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax—or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income.",9
2007-01-23,gwb,"Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,"With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings, $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic, private health insurance plan within their reach.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,Changing the Tax Code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.,7
2007-01-23,gwb,My second proposal is to help the States that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive Federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick.,6
2007-01-23,gwb,I have asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing Federal funds and use them to create Affordable Choices grants.,7
2007-01-23,gwb,These grants would give our Nation's Governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need.,6
2007-01-23,gwb,There are many other ways that Congress can help.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,We need to expand health savings accounts.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,We need to help small businesses through association health plans.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,We need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,We will encourage price transparency.,2
2007-01-23,gwb,"And to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we need to pass medical liability reform.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"In all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are not made by government and insurance companies but by patients and their doctors.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,"Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of America, with laws that are fair and borders that are secure.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"To secure our border, we're doubling the size of the Border Patrol and funding new infrastructure and technology.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border, and that requires a temporary-worker program.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis.,6
2007-01-23,gwb,"As a result, they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"We'll enforce our immigration laws at the worksite and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there's no excuse left for violating the law.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,"Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass and I can sign comprehensive immigration reform into law.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,"For too long, our Nation has been dependent on foreign oil.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments and raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,It's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,The way forward is through technology.,2
2007-01-23,gwb,"We must continue changing the way America generates electric power by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power.",10
2007-01-23,gwb,We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel.,7
2007-01-23,gwb,"We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol, using everything from wood chips to grasses to agricultural wastes.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"We made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,And now even more dramatic advances are within reach.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,Tonight I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal.,5
2007-01-23,gwb,Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years.,9
2007-01-23,gwb,"When we do that, we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the Middle East.",10
2007-01-23,gwb,"To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017, and that is nearly five times the current target.",8
2007-01-23,gwb,"At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks, and conserve up to 81⁄2 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"And so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil.,9
2007-01-23,gwb,"And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,The lives of our citizens across our Nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our Federal courts.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,We have a shared obligation to ensure that the Federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,"As President, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the Federal bench, and the United States Senate has a duty as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,"For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause.,7
2007-01-23,gwb,We've had time to take stock of our situation.,6
2007-01-23,gwb,We've added many critical protections to guard the homeland.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,"We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us, unless we stop them.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions.,3
2007-01-23,gwb,"Yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror, we must take the fight to the enemy.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,"The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,"For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same.",3
2007-01-23,gwb,Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,"We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,We stopped an Al Qaida plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast.,7
2007-01-23,gwb,We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States.,5
2007-01-23,gwb,We uncovered an Al Qaida cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America.,7
2007-01-23,gwb,"And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,"For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy.,6
2007-01-23,gwb,The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world.,5
2007-01-23,gwb,"And so long as that's the case, America is still a nation at war.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"In the mind of the terrorists, this war began well before September the 11th and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,And these past 5 years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy.,6
2007-01-23,gwb,Al Qaida and its followers are Sunni extremists possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology.,7
2007-01-23,gwb,"Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite.",3
2007-01-23,gwb,"They preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,They want to overthrow moderate governments and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country.,9
2007-01-23,gwb,"By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology.,5
2007-01-23,gwb,"Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: ""We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse.""",7
2007-01-23,gwb,"Usama bin Laden declared: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us.""",8
2007-01-23,gwb,"These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,"In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shi'a extremists who are just as hostile to America and are also determined to dominate the Middle East.",10
2007-01-23,gwb,"Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like Hizballah, a group second only to Al Qaida in the American lives it has taken.",15
2007-01-23,gwb,The Shi'a and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,"Whatever slogans they chant when they slaughter the innocent, they have the same wicked purposes.",4
2007-01-23,gwb,"They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale.",8
2007-01-23,gwb,"In the sixth year since our Nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangers have ended.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,They have not.,1
2007-01-23,gwb,"And so it remains the policy of this Government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people.",10
2007-01-23,gwb,This war is more than a clash of arms; it is a decisive ideological struggle.,6
2007-01-23,gwb,And the security of our Nation is in the balance.,4
2007-01-23,gwb,"To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us.",7
2007-01-23,gwb,"What every terrorist fears most is human freedom: societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,"Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies, and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy.,6
2007-01-23,gwb,The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity.,8
2007-01-23,gwb,"And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"In the last 2 years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East, and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction.",6
2007-01-23,gwb,"In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution.",5
2007-01-23,gwb,They drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections.,4

2007-01-11,gwb,"Our past efforts to secure Baghdad failed for two principal reasons: There were not enough Iraqi and American troops to secure neighborhoods that had been cleared of terrorists and insurgents, and there were too many restrictions on the troops we did have.",7
2007-01-11,gwb,Our military commanders reviewed the new Iraqi plan to ensure that it addressed these mistakes.,5
2007-01-11,gwb,They report that it does.,2
2007-01-11,gwb,They also report that this plan can work.,3
2007-01-11,gwb,"Now, let me explain the main elements of this effort.",5
2007-01-11,gwb,The Iraqi Government will appoint a military commander and two deputy commanders for their capital.,3
2007-01-11,gwb,The Iraqi Government will deploy Iraqi Army and National Police brigades across Baghdad's nine districts.,5
2007-01-11,gwb,"When these forces are fully deployed, there will be 18 Iraqi Army and National Police brigades committed to this effort, along with local police.",5
2007-01-11,gwb,"These Iraqi forces will operate from local police stations, conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints and going door to door to gain the trust of Baghdad residents.",8
2007-01-11,gwb,"This is a strong commitment, but for it to succeed, our commanders say the Iraqis will need our help.",4
2007-01-11,gwb,So America will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of Baghdad.,9
2007-01-11,gwb,This will require increasing American force levels.,2
2007-01-11,gwb,"So I've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq.",3
2007-01-11,gwb,"The vast majority of them, five brigades, will be deployed to Baghdad.",3
2007-01-11,gwb,These troops will work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded in their formations.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,"Our troops will have a well-defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods, to help them protect the local population, and to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security that Baghdad needs.",11
2007-01-11,gwb,Many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure Baghdad did not.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,"Well, here are the differences.",2
2007-01-11,gwb,"In earlier operations, Iraqi and American forces cleared many neighborhoods of terrorists and insurgents, but when our forces moved on to other targets, the killers returned.",5
2007-01-11,gwb,This time we'll have the force levels we need to hold the areas that have been cleared.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,"In earlier operations, political and sectarian interference prevented Iraqi and American forces from going into neighborhoods that are home to those fueling the sectarian violence.",11
2007-01-11,gwb,"This time Iraqi and American forces will have a green light to enter those neighborhoods, and Prime Minister Maliki has pledged that political or sectarian interference will not be tolerated.",5
2007-01-11,gwb,I have made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,"If the Iraqi Government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people, and it will lose the support of the Iraqi people.",5
2007-01-11,gwb,Now is the time to act.,3
2007-01-11,gwb,The Prime Minister understands this.,2
2007-01-11,gwb,"Here is what he told his people just last week: ""The Baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of their sectarian or political affiliation.""",8
2007-01-11,gwb,"This new strategy will not yield an immediate end to suicide bombings, assassinations, or IED attacks.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,Our enemies in Iraq will make every effort to ensure that our television screens are filled with images of death and suffering.,8
2007-01-11,gwb,"Yet over time, we can expect to see Iraqi troops chasing down murderers, fewer brazen acts of terror, and growing trust and cooperation from Baghdad's residents.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,"When this happens, daily life will improve, Iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders, and the Government will have the breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas.",7
2007-01-11,gwb,"Most of Iraq's Sunni and Shi'a want to live together in peace, and reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make reconciliation possible.",5
2007-01-11,gwb,A successful strategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations.,3
2007-01-11,gwb,Ordinary Iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,So America will hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,"To establish its authority, the Iraqi Government plans to take responsibility for security in all of Iraq's Provinces by November.",10
2007-01-11,gwb,"To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,"To show that it is committed to delivering a better life, the Iraqi Government will spend $10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will create new jobs.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,"To empower local leaders, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later this year.",3
2007-01-11,gwb,"And to allow more Iraqis to reenter their nation's political life, the Government will reform de-Ba'athification laws and establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's Constitution.",9
2007-01-11,gwb,America will change our approach to help the Iraqi Government as it works to meet these benchmarks.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,"In keeping with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, we will increase the embedding of American advisers in Iraqi Army units and partner a coalition brigade with every Iraqi Army division.",7
2007-01-11,gwb,"We will help the Iraqis build a larger and better equipped army, and we will accelerate the training of Iraqi forces, which remains the essential U.S. security mission in Iraq.",8
2007-01-11,gwb,We will give our commanders and civilians greater flexibility to spend funds for economic assistance.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,We will double the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,"These teams bring together military and civilian experts to help local Iraqi communities pursue reconciliation, strengthen the moderates, and speed the transition to Iraqi self-reliance.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,And Secretary Rice will soon appoint a reconstruction coordinator in Baghdad to ensure better results for economic assistance being spent in Iraq.,7
2007-01-11,gwb,"As we make these changes, we will continue to pursue Al Qaida and foreign fighters.",4
2007-01-11,gwb,Al Qaida is still active in Iraq.,3
2007-01-11,gwb,Its home base is Anbar Province.,2
2007-01-11,gwb,Al Qaida has helped make Anbar the most violent area of Iraq outside the capital.,5
2007-01-11,gwb,A captured Al Qaida document describes the terrorists' plan to infiltrate and seize control of the Province.,7
2007-01-11,gwb,"This would bring Al Qaida closer to its goals of taking down Iraq's democracy, building a radical Islamic empire, and launching new attacks on the United States, at home and abroad.",11
2007-01-11,gwb,"Our military forces in Anbar are killing and capturing Al Qaida leaders, and they are protecting the local population.",4
2007-01-11,gwb,"Recently, local tribal leaders have begun to show their willingness to take on Al Qaida.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,"And as a result, our commanders believe we have an opportunity to deal a serious blow to the terrorists.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,"So I have given orders to increase American forces in Anbar Province by 4,000 troops.",5
2007-01-11,gwb,These troops will work with Iraqi and tribal forces to keep up the pressure on the terrorists.,5
2007-01-11,gwb,"America's men and women in uniform took away Al Qaida's safe haven in Afghanistan, and we will not allow them to reestablish it in Iraq.",4
2007-01-11,gwb,Succeeding in Iraq also requires defending its territorial integrity and stabilizing the region in the face of extremist challenges.,7
2007-01-11,gwb,This begins with addressing Iran and Syria.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,These two regimes are allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their territory to move in and out of Iraq.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,Iran is providing material support for attacks on American troops.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,We will disrupt the attacks on our forces.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,"We'll interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria, and we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq.",8
2007-01-11,gwb,We're also taking other steps to bolster the security of Iraq and protect American interests in the Middle East.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,I recently ordered the deployment of an additional carrier strike group to the region.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,We will expand intelligence sharing and deploy Patriot air defense systems to reassure our friends and allies.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,We will work with the Governments of Turkey and Iraq to help them resolve problems along their border.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,And we will work with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating the region.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,We will use America's full diplomatic resources to rally support for Iraq from nations throughout the Middle East.,7
2007-01-11,gwb,"Countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf States need to understand that an American defeat in Iraq would create a new sanctuary for extremists and a strategic threat to their survival.",7
2007-01-11,gwb,"These nations have a stake in a successful Iraq that is at peace with its neighbors, and they must step up their support for Iraq's unity Government.",9
2007-01-11,gwb,We endorse the Iraqi Government's call to finalize an international compact that will bring new economic assistance in exchange for greater economic reform.,9
2007-01-11,gwb,"And on Friday, Secretary Rice will leave for the region to build support for Iraq and continue the urgent diplomacy required to help bring peace to the Middle East.",9
2007-01-11,gwb,The challenge playing out across the broader Middle East is more than a military conflict.,5
2007-01-11,gwb,It is the decisive ideological struggle of our time.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,On one side are those who believe in freedom and moderation; on the other side are extremists who kill the innocent and have declared their intention to destroy our way of life.,8
2007-01-11,gwb,"In the long run, the most realistic way to protect the American people is to provide a hopeful alternative to the hateful ideology of the enemy by advancing liberty across a troubled region.",7
2007-01-11,gwb,It is in the interests of the United States to stand with the brave men and women who are risking their lives to claim their freedom and to help them as they work to raise up just and hopeful societies across the Middle East.,12
2007-01-11,gwb,"From Afghanistan to Lebanon to the Palestinian Territories, millions of ordinary people are sick of the violence and want a future of peace and opportunity for their children.",5
2007-01-11,gwb,And they are looking at Iraq.,2
2007-01-11,gwb,"They want to know: Will America withdraw and yield the future of that country to the extremists, or will we stand with the Iraqis who have made the choice for freedom?",8
2007-01-11,gwb,The changes I have outlined tonight are aimed at ensuring the survival of a young democracy that is fighting for its life in a part of the world of enormous importance to American security.,15
2007-01-11,gwb,"Let me be clear: The terrorists and insurgents in Iraq are without conscience, and they will make the year ahead bloody and violent.",4
2007-01-11,gwb,"Even if our new strategy works exactly as planned, deadly acts of violence will continue, and we must expect more Iraqi and American casualties.",4
2007-01-11,gwb,The question is whether our new strategy will bring us closer to success.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,I believe that it will.,2
2007-01-11,gwb,Victory will not look like the ones our fathers and grandfathers achieved.,5
2007-01-11,gwb,There will be no surrender ceremony on the deck of a battleship.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,"But victory in Iraq will bring something new in the Arab world: a functioning democracy that polices its territory, upholds the rule of law, respects fundamental human liberties, and answers to its people.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,"A democratic Iraq will not be perfect, but it will be a country that fights terrorists instead of harboring them, and it will help bring a future of peace and security for our children and our grandchildren.",10
2007-01-11,gwb,This new approach comes after consultations with Congress about the different courses we could take in Iraq.,7
2007-01-11,gwb,"Many are concerned that the Iraqis are becoming too dependent on the United States, and therefore, our policy should focus on protecting Iraq's borders and hunting down Al Qaida.",9
2007-01-11,gwb,Their solution is to scale back America's efforts in Baghdad or announce the phased withdrawal of our combat forces.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,"We carefully considered these proposals, and we concluded that to step back now would force a collapse of the Iraqi Government, tear the country apart, and result in mass killings on an unimaginable scale.",7
2007-01-11,gwb,Such a scenario would result in our troops being forced to stay in Iraq even longer and confront an enemy that is even more lethal.,9
2007-01-11,gwb,"If we increase our support at this crucial moment and help the Iraqis break the current cycle of violence, we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,"In the days ahead, my national security team will fully brief Congress on our new strategy.",3
2007-01-11,gwb,"If Members have improvements that can be made, we will make them.",4
2007-01-11,gwb,"If circumstances change, we will adjust.",2
2007-01-11,gwb,"Honorable people have different views, and they will voice their criticisms.",3
2007-01-11,gwb,It is fair to hold our views up to scrutiny.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,And all involved have a responsibility to explain how the path they propose would be more likely to succeed.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,"Acting on the good advice of Senator Joe Lieberman and other key Members of Congress, we will form a new, bipartisan working group that will help us come together across party lines to win the war on terror.",8
2007-01-11,gwb,This group will meet regularly with me and my administration; it will help strengthen our relationship with Congress.,5
2007-01-11,gwb,"We can begin by working together to increase the size of the active Army and Marine Corps, so that America has the Armed Forces we need for the 21st century.",8
2007-01-11,gwb,"We also need to examine ways to mobilize talented American civilians to deploy overseas, where they can help build democratic institutions in communities and nations recovering from war and tyranny.",8
2007-01-11,gwb,"In these dangerous times, the United States is blessed to have extraordinary and selfless men and women willing to step forward and defend us.",5
2007-01-11,gwb,These young Americans understand that our cause in Iraq is noble and necessary and that the advance of freedom is the calling of our time.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,"They serve far from their families, who make the quiet sacrifices of lonely holidays and empty chairs at the dinner table.",8
2007-01-11,gwb,They have watched their comrades give their lives to ensure our liberty.,4
2007-01-11,gwb,"We mourn the loss of every fallen American, and we owe it to them to build a future worthy of their sacrifice.",7
2007-01-11,gwb,"Fellow citizens, the year ahead will demand more patience, sacrifice, and resolve.",3
2007-01-11,gwb,It can be tempting to think that America can put aside the burdens of freedom.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,"Yet times of testing reveal the character of a nation, and throughout our history, Americans have always defied the pessimists and seen our faith in freedom redeemed.",6
2007-01-11,gwb,Now America is engaged in a new struggle that will set the course for a new century.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,We can and we will prevail.,2
2007-01-11,gwb,We go forward with trust that the Author of Liberty will guide us through these trying hours.,6
2007-01-11,gwb,Thank you and good night.,3
2002-06-06,gwb,Good evening.,1
2002-06-06,gwb,"During the next few minutes, I want to update you on the progress we are making in our war against terror and to propose sweeping changes that will strengthen our homeland against the ongoing threat of terrorist attacks.",12
2002-06-06,gwb,Nearly 9 months have passed since the day that forever changed our country.,5
2002-06-06,gwb,Debris from what was once the World Trade Center has been cleared away in a hundred thousand truckloads.,4
2002-06-06,gwb,The west side of the Pentagon looks almost as it did on September the 10th.,4
2002-06-06,gwb,"And as children finish school and families prepare for summer vacations, for many life seems almost normal.",4
2002-06-06,gwb,"Yet, we are a different nation today, sadder and stronger, less innocent and more courageous, more appreciative of life, and for many who serve our country, more willing to risk life in a great cause.",6
2002-06-06,gwb,"For those who have lost family and friends, the pain will never go away, and neither will the responsibilities that day thrust upon all of us.",7
2002-06-06,gwb,America is leading the civilized world in a titanic struggle against terror.,4
2002-06-06,gwb,"Freedom and fear are at war, and freedom is winning.",2
2002-06-06,gwb,"Tonight over 60,000 American troops are deployed around the world in the war against terror: more than 7,000 in Afghanistan; others in the Philippines, Yemen, and the Republic of Georgia, to train local forces.",8
2002-06-06,gwb,"Next week Afghanistan will begin selecting a representative government, even as American troops, along with our allies, still continuously raid remote Al Qaida hiding places.",5
2002-06-06,gwb,"Among those we have captured is a man named Abu Zubaydah, Al Qaida's chief of operations.",6
2002-06-06,gwb,"From him and from hundreds of others, we are learning more about how the terrorists plan and operate, information crucial in anticipating and preventing future attacks.",7
2002-06-06,gwb,Our coalition is strong.,2
2002-06-06,gwb,"More than 90 nations have arrested or detained over 2,400 terrorists and their supporters.",4
2002-06-06,gwb,More than 180 countries have offered or are providing assistance in the war on terrorism.,5
2002-06-06,gwb,And our military is strong and prepared to oppose any emerging threat to the American people.,6
2002-06-06,gwb,Every day in this war will not bring the drama of liberating a country.,5
2002-06-06,gwb,"Yet, every day brings new information, a tip or arrest, another step or two or three in a relentless march to bring security to our Nation and justice to our enemies.",7
2002-06-06,gwb,Every day I review a document called the threat assessment.,4
2002-06-06,gwb,It summarizes what our intelligence services and key law enforcement agencies have picked up about terrorist activity.,5
2002-06-06,gwb,"Sometimes the information is very general, vague talk, bragging about future attacks.",4
2002-06-06,gwb,"Sometimes the information is more specific, as in a recent case when an Al Qaida detainee said attacks were planned against financial institutions.",5
2002-06-06,gwb,"When credible intelligence warrants, appropriate law enforcement and local officials are alerted.",4
2002-06-06,gwb,"These warnings are, unfortunately, a new reality in American life, and we have recently seen an increase in the volume of general threats.",7
2002-06-06,gwb,Americans should continue to do what you're doing.,3
2002-06-06,gwb,"Go about your lives, but pay attention to your surroundings.",4
2002-06-06,gwb,Add your eyes and ears to the protection of our homeland.,5
2002-06-06,gwb,"In protecting our country, we depend on the skill of our people, the troops we send to battle, intelligence operatives who risk their lives for bits of information, law enforcement officers who sift for clues and search for suspects.",7
2002-06-06,gwb,"We are now learning that before September the 11th, the suspicions and insights of some of our frontline agents did not get enough attention.",7
2002-06-06,gwb,My administration supports the important work of the intelligence committees in Congress to review the activities of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.,6
2002-06-06,gwb,"We need to know when warnings were missed or signs unheeded, not to point the finger or blame but to make sure we correct any problems and prevent them from happening again.",9
2002-06-06,gwb,"Based on everything I've seen, I do not believe anyone could have prevented the horror of September the 11th.",6
2002-06-06,gwb,"Yet, we now know that thousands of trained killers are plotting to attack us, and this terrible knowledge requires us to act differently.",5
2002-06-06,gwb,"If you're a frontline worker for the FBI, the CIA, some other law enforcement or intelligence agency and you see something that raises suspicions, I want you to report it immediately.",6
2002-06-06,gwb,I expect your supervisors to treat it with the seriousness it deserves.,5
2002-06-06,gwb,Information must be fully shared so we can follow every lead to find the one that may prevent tragedy.,6
2002-06-06,gwb,I applaud the leaders and employees at the FBI and CIA for beginning essential reforms.,4
2002-06-06,gwb,They must continue to think and act differently to defeat the enemy.,5
2002-06-06,gwb,"The first and best way to secure America's homeland is to attack the enemy where he hides and plans, and we're doing just that.",5
2002-06-06,gwb,"We're also taking significant steps to strengthen our homeland protections, securing cockpits, tightening our borders, stockpiling vaccines, increasing security at water treatment and nuclear powerplants.",10
2002-06-06,gwb,"After September the 11th, we needed to move quickly, and so I appointed Tom Ridge as my Homeland Security Adviser.",5
2002-06-06,gwb,"As Governor Ridge has worked with all levels of government to prepare a national strategy and as we have learned more about the plans and capabilities of the terrorist network, we have concluded that our Government must be reorganized to deal more effectively with the new threats of the 21st century.",7
2002-06-06,gwb,"So tonight I ask the Congress to join me in creating a single, permanent department with an overriding and urgent mission, securing the homeland of America and protecting the American people.",8
2002-06-06,gwb,"Right now as many as a hundred different Government agencies have some responsibilities for homeland security, and no one has final accountability.",4
2002-06-06,gwb,"For example, the Coast Guard has several missions, from search and rescue to maritime treaty enforcement.",5
2002-06-06,gwb,"It reports to the Transportation Department, whose primary responsibilities are roads, rails, bridges, and the airways.",8
2002-06-06,gwb,"The Customs Service, among other duties, collects tariffs and prevents smuggling, and it is part of the Treasury Department, whose primary responsibility is fiscal policy, not security.",8
2002-06-06,gwb,"Tonight I propose a permanent Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security to unite essential agencies that must work more closely together: Among them, the Coast Guard, the Border Patrol, the Customs Service, Immigration officials, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",5
2002-06-06,gwb,Employees of this new agency will come to work every morning knowing their most important job is to protect their fellow citizens.,4
2002-06-06,gwb,"The Department of Homeland Security will be charged with four primary tasks: This new agency will control our borders and prevent terrorists and explosives from entering our country; it will work with State and local authorities to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies; it will bring together our best scientists to develop technologies that detect biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons, and to discover the drugs and treatments to best protect our citizens; and this new Department will review intelligence and law enforcement information from all agencies of Government and produce a single daily picture of threats against our homeland.",3
2002-06-06,gwb,Analysts will be responsible for imagining the worst and planning to counter it.,6
2002-06-06,gwb,The reason to create this Department is not to create the size of Government but to increase its focus and effectiveness.,4
2002-06-06,gwb,The staff of this new Department will be largely drawn from the agencies we are combining.,4
2002-06-06,gwb,"By ending duplication and overlap, we will spend less on overhead and more on protecting America.",4
2002-06-06,gwb,This reorganization will give the good people of our Government their best opportunity to succeed by organizing our resources in a way that is thorough and unified.,9
2002-06-06,gwb,What I am proposing tonight is the most extensive reorganization of the Federal Government since the 1940s.,4
2002-06-06,gwb,"During his Presidency, Harry Truman recognized that our Nation's fragmented defenses had to be reorganized to win the cold war.",5
2002-06-06,gwb,"He proposed uniting our military forces under a single Department of Defense and creating the National Security Council to bring together defense, intelligence, and diplomacy.",6
2002-06-06,gwb,"Truman's reforms are still helping us to fight terror abroad, and now we need similar dramatic reforms to secure our people at home.",4
2002-06-06,gwb,Only the United States Congress can create a new department of Government.,3
2002-06-06,gwb,So tonight I ask for your help in encouraging your Representatives to support my plan.,5
2002-06-06,gwb,"We face an urgent need, and we must move quickly, this year, before the end of the congressional session.",6
2002-06-06,gwb,"All in our Government have learned a great deal since September the 11th, and we must act on every lesson.",4
2002-06-06,gwb,"We are stronger and better prepared tonight than we were on that terrible morning, and with your help and the support of the Congress, we will be stronger still.",7
2002-06-06,gwb,History has called our Nation into action.,2
2002-06-06,gwb,"History has placed a great challenge before us: Will America, with our unique position and power, blink in the face of terror, or will we lead to a freer, more civilized world?",7
2002-06-06,gwb,"There's only one answer: This great country will lead the world to safety, security, peace, and freedom.",5
2002-06-06,gwb,Thank you for listening.,2
2002-06-06,gwb,"Good night, and may God bless America.",2
2001-09-11,gwb,Good evening.,1
2001-09-11,gwb,"Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts.",6
2001-09-11,gwb,"The victims were in airplanes or in their offices: secretaries, business men and women, military and Federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors.",9

2002-09-12,gwb,"The Security Council resolutions will be enforced, the just demands of peace and security will be met, or action will be unavoidable.",5
2002-09-12,gwb,And a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power.,4

2002-09-12,gwb,"With every step the Iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons, our own options to confront that regime will narrow.",9

2002-09-12,gwb,These nations can show by their example that honest government and respect for women and the great Islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the Middle East and beyond.,5
2002-09-12,gwb,And we will show that the promise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our time.,5

2002-09-17,gwb,I want to thank you all for coming today.,4
2002-09-17,gwb,I particularly want to thank our Secretary of Education for traveling with me -- Rod Paige.,5
2002-09-17,gwb,I picked Rod out of a lot of really good candidates because I wanted somebody to be in Washington who had actually been on the front lines of educating every child.,8
2002-09-17,gwb,We didn't need any more theory in Washington.,2
2002-09-17,gwb,We needed people that actually done.,3
2002-09-17,gwb,"And when we talk about raising the bar and challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, so that every child can learn, when we talk about having an accountability system to make sure no child is left behind, our Secretary of Education has actually done it.",8
2002-09-17,gwb,"He ran one of the largest school districts in my state, our state, and he did so with class and dignity.",7
2002-09-17,gwb,"And the children of Houston, Texas are better off for it.",3

2002-09-17,gwb,Pedro is a good leader.,2
2002-09-17,gwb,It's very interesting -- we were talking before we came out here and Pedro was a part of what they call Operation Pedro Pan -- Operation Peter Pan.,8
2002-09-17,gwb,"So, by the way, was a member of my Cabinet, Mel Martinez.",4
2002-09-17,gwb,"When both Pedro and Mel were young men, their parents wanted their children to grow up in freedom.",3
2002-09-17,gwb,So they put them on an airplane to a foreign land.,3

2005-02-02,gwb,They're abhorrent abuses.,2
2005-02-02,gwb,They do not reflect—the actions of these few people do not reflect the hearts of the American people.,4
2005-02-02,gwb,The American people are just as appalled at what they have seen on TV as the Iraqi citizens have.,6
2005-02-02,gwb,The Iraqi citizens must understand that.,2
2005-02-02,gwb,"And therefore, there will be a full investigation, and justice will be served.",2
2005-02-02,gwb,And we will do to ourselves what we expect of others.,3
2005-02-02,gwb,"And when we say, ""You've got human rights abuses, take care of the problem,"" we will do the same thing.",5
2005-02-02,gwb,We're taking care of the problem.,3

2005-02-02,gwb,Cooperation Within Iraq Q.,3
2005-02-02,gwb,Transferring control of Fallujah in Iraq to former army officers under Saddam Hussein led many people in Iraq and even in the Arab world to believe that the U.S. is lowering its expectation.,6

2005-02-02,gwb,And that's what you're seeing in Fallujah.,3
2005-02-02,gwb,"As a matter of fact, the general in charge of the operation in Fallujah had been imprisoned by Sad-dam Hussein.",7
2005-02-02,gwb,So he felt the vindictiveness of the Hussein regime.,4
2005-02-02,gwb,"And I've got confidence that Iraq will be a peaceful, self-governing nation.",5
2005-02-02,gwb,"And I also have confidence that, with help, the Iraqi security forces will be strong against foreign terrorists and others who are willing to kill and criminals who are willing to try to wreak havoc in this society.",15

2005-02-02,gwb,The President.,1
2005-02-02,gwb,"Oh, no.",1
2005-02-02,gwb,"There are citizens, for example, in the—amongst the teacher ranks in Sunni—parts of Sunni Iraq that were denied the right to teach because they may have been affiliated with the Ba'athist Party in the past but who are very important to the future of Iraq because they're teachers.",10
2005-02-02,gwb,"And of course, they are now being let back in the classroom, not to spread political propaganda but to teach, to teach children.",4
2005-02-02,gwb,"And obviously, there is a process of balancing those who may have been affiliated with the Ba'ath Party and those who are terrorists and killers.",11
2005-02-02,gwb,"And obviously, terrorists and killers and extremists will not be a part of the Government, but people who are by and large peaceful people, who care deeply about the future of Iraq, will be.",10

2005-02-02,gwb,"The people of Iraq must understand, sovereignty will be transferred on June 30th.",4
2005-02-02,gwb,And there's a process now in place to make sure that there's an entity to which we transfer sovereignty.,7
2005-02-02,gwb,And then there will be elections.,1
2005-02-02,gwb,And I think the timetable we're on is a realistic timetable.,4
2005-02-02,gwb,"It's one that will be met, and I believe that the elections will help the Iraqi citizens realize that freedom is coming.",5
2005-02-02,gwb,Israeli Disengagement Plan Q.,2
2005-02-02,gwb,"If I may ask you my final question on the issue of the peace efforts that you are conducting, you supported Prime Minister Sharon's plan to withdraw from Gaza, and you sent senior officials to Israel, and Israeli officials came to Washington and negotiated that plan.",8
2005-02-02,gwb,Do you think it was a mistake to support a plan before the Prime Minister secured the support of his own party?,7
2005-02-02,gwb,The President.,1
2005-02-02,gwb,"I think when you see a step toward peace, it's important for a peaceful nation like America to embrace it.",5
2005-02-02,gwb,And I felt that a withdrawal from the Gaza by the Israeli Prime Minister as well as the withdrawal from four settlements from the West Bank by the Israeli Prime Minister was a step toward peace.,8
2005-02-02,gwb,"And at the time he did so, I called for the United States and others to seize this moment— the Quartet and the European Union and Russia and the United Nations and, hopefully, the World Bank, to seize this moment and to help the development of a Palestinian state that will be at peace with its neighbors, a Palestinian state that will provide hope for long-suffering Palestinian people.",19
2005-02-02,gwb,I think this is an historic moment for the world.,5
2005-02-02,gwb,I think this is a good opportunity to step forth.,4
2005-02-02,gwb,I am confident that a peaceful Palestinian state can emerge.,4
2005-02-02,gwb,I'm the first President ever to call for the establishment of a Palestinian state.,7
2005-02-02,gwb,I still feel strongly that there should be one.,2
2005-02-02,gwb,"I also recognize that we have got a duty, all of us, to fight off the terrorists who are trying to stop the spread of a peaceful Palestinian state or the creation of a Palestinian state.",12
2005-02-02,gwb,"And now is the time to make progress, and I believe we can.",3
2005-02-02,gwb,There was a good statement yesterday out of the Quartet that confirmed our desire for a Palestinian state to emerge.,8
2005-02-02,gwb,And it's—what the Prime Minister of Israel did was—took a political risk; obviously he did.,6
2005-02-02,gwb,"I mean, his own party condemned the statement—condemned the policy.",4
2005-02-02,gwb,"However, I still believe it was the right thing for him to do, and we support peace in the Middle East.",5

2001-02-16,gwb,Education is a key to that future; we will increase exchanges and internships that help develop human capital and promote respect for each other's rich cultural heritage.,7

2008-05-21,gwb,"For a year and a half, I have consistently asked that the Congress pass a good farm bill that I can sign.",4
2008-05-21,gwb,"Regrettably, the Congress has failed to do so.",2
2008-05-21,gwb,"At a time of high food prices and record farm income, this bill lacks program reform and fiscal discipline.",6
2008-05-21,gwb,"It continues subsidies for the wealthy and increases farm bill spending by more than $20 billion, while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase.",7
2008-05-21,gwb,"It is inconsistent with our objectives in international trade negotiations, which include securing greater market access for American farmers and ranchers.",11
2008-05-21,gwb,It would needlessly expand the size and scope of government.,3
2008-05-21,gwb,Americans sent us to Washington to achieve results and be good stewards of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars.,7
2008-05-21,gwb,This bill violates that fundamental commitment.,2
2008-05-21,gwb,"In January 2007, my Administration put forward a fiscally responsible farm bill proposal that would improve the safety net for farmers and move current programs toward more market-oriented policies.",7
2008-05-21,gwb,The bill before me today fails to achieve these important goals.,3
2008-05-21,gwb,"At a time when net farm income is projected to increase by more than $28 billion in 1 year, the American taxpayer should not be forced to subsidize that group of farmers who have adjusted gross incomes of up to $1.5 million.",7
2008-05-21,gwb,"When commodity prices are at record highs, it is irresponsible to increase government subsidy rates for 15 crops, subsidize additional crops, and provide payments that further distort markets.",6
2008-05-21,gwb,"Instead of better targeting farm programs, this bill eliminates the existing payment limit on marketing loan subsidies.",4
2008-05-21,gwb,Now is also not the time to create a new uncapped revenue guarantee that could cost billions of dollars more than advertised.,7
2008-05-21,gwb,This is on top of a farm bill that is anticipated to cost more than $600 billion over 10 years.,9
2008-05-21,gwb,"In addition, this bill would force many businesses to prepay their taxes in order to finance the additional spending.",6
2008-05-21,gwb,This legislation is also filled with earmarks and other ill-considered provisions.,5
2008-05-21,gwb,"Most notably, H.R.",2
2008-05-21,gwb,"2419 provides: $175 million to address water issues for desert lakes; $250 million for a 400,000-acre land purchase from a private owner; funding and authority for the noncompetitive sale of National Forest land to a ski resort; and $382 million earmarked for a specific watershed.",8
2008-05-21,gwb,"These earmarks, and the expansion of Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements, have no place in the farm bill.",7
2008-05-21,gwb,Rural and urban Americans alike are frustrated with excessive government spending and the funneling of taxpayer funds for pet projects.,8
2008-05-21,gwb,This bill will only add to that frustration.,3
2008-05-21,gwb,"The bill also contains a wide range of other objectionable provisions, including one that restricts our ability to redirect food aid dollars for emergency use at a time of great need globally.",13
2008-05-21,gwb,The bill does not include the requested authority to buy food in the developing world to save lives.,5
2008-05-21,gwb,"Additionally, provisions in the bill raise serious constitutional concerns.",4
2008-05-21,gwb,"For all the reasons outlined above, I must veto H.R.",4
2008-05-21,gwb,"2419, and I urge the Congress to extend current law for a year or more.",6
2008-05-21,gwb,"I veto this bill fully aware that it is rare for a stand-alone farm bill not to receive the President's signature, but my action today is not without precedent.",6
2008-05-21,gwb,"In 1956, President Eisenhower stood firmly on principle, citing high crop subsidies and too much government control of farm programs among the reasons for his veto.",7

2006-07-19,gwb,"Yet, as science brings us ever closer to unlocking the secrets of human biology, it also offers temptations to manipulate human life and violate human dignity.",8
2006-07-19,gwb,Our conscience and history as a Nation demand that we resist this temptation.,5
2006-07-19,gwb,"With the right scientific techniques and the right policies, we can achieve scientific progress while living up to our ethical responsibilities.",4
2006-07-19,gwb,"In 2001, I set forth a new policy on stem cell research that struck a balance between the needs of science and the demands of conscience.",8
2006-07-19,gwb,"When I took office, there was no Federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research.",5
2006-07-19,gwb,"Under the policy I announced 5 years ago, my Administration became the first to make Federal funds available for this research, but only on embryonic stem cell lines derived from embryos that had already been destroyed.",7
2006-07-19,gwb,My Administration has made available more than $90 million for research of these lines.,6
2006-07-19,gwb,This policy has allowed important research to go forward and has allowed America to continue to lead the world in embryonic stem cell research without encouraging the further destruction of living human embryos.,10
2006-07-19,gwb,H.R.,0
2006-07-19,gwb,810 would overturn my Administration's balanced policy on embryonic stem cell research.,5
2006-07-19,gwb,"If this bill were to become law, American taxpayers for the first time in our history would be compelled to fund the deliberate destruction of human embryos.",6
2006-07-19,gwb,Crossing this line would be a grave mistake and would needlessly encourage a conflict between science and ethics that can only do damage to both and harm our Nation as a whole.,7
2006-07-19,gwb,Advances in research show that stem cell science can progress in an ethical way.,4
2006-07-19,gwb,"Since I announced my policy in 2001, my Administration has expanded funding of research into stem cells that can be drawn from children, adults, and the blood in umbilical cords with no harm to the donor, and these stem cells are currently being used in medical treatments.",11
2006-07-19,gwb,Science also offers the hope that we may one day enjoy the potential benefits of embryonic stem cells without destroying human life.,6
2006-07-19,gwb,Researchers are investigating new techniques that might allow doctors and scientists to produce stem cells just as versatile as those derived from human embryos without harming life.,10
2006-07-19,gwb,"We must continue to explore these hopeful alternatives, so we can advance the cause of scientific research while staying true to the ideals of a decent and humane society.",7
2006-07-19,gwb,I hold to the principle that we can harness the promise of technology without becoming slaves to technology and ensure that science serves the cause of humanity.,10
2006-07-19,gwb,"If we are to find the right ways to advance ethical medical research, we must also be willing when necessary to reject the wrong ways.",6

2003-02-12,gwb,"He discussed the latest developments in the war on terror, and continued his consultations with members of Congress.",6
2003-02-12,gwb,"From there, the President had his intelligence briefing, and then he had an FBI briefing, and then he convened a meeting of the National Security Council.",6

2003-02-12,gwb,"The President is going to focus on the importance of passing the domestic agenda, passing the budget, and particularly the economic program the President announced involving elimination of the double taxation on dividends.",10
2003-02-12,gwb,Let me make an announcement about what just took place in Vienna.,6
2003-02-12,gwb,The IAEA board of governors resolution is a clear indication that the international community will not accept a North Korea nuclear weapons program.,5

2003-02-12,gwb,Today's vote demonstrates that this is not a bilateral issue between the United States and North Korea; this is a dispute between North Korea and the world.,7
2003-02-12,gwb,The United States seeks a multilateral solution to this program through diplomacy.,4
2003-02-12,gwb,We plan to work closely with members of the Security Council and other friends and allies toward our shared objective with the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons program in a verifiable and irreversible manner.,11
2002-12-20,gwb,James S. Brady Press Briefing Room  12:50 P.M. EST  MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon.,3
2002-12-20,gwb,"Let me give you a report on the President's day, and then I have a statement by the President I'd like to read.",6
2002-12-20,gwb,The President began this morning with a phone call to the President-elect Roh Moo-Hyun of South Korea.,7
2002-12-20,gwb,The President called President-elect Roh to extend his warm congratulations on Mr. Roh's victory in South Korea's December 19th presidential election.,7
2002-12-20,gwb,The President and the President-elect agreed to work closely together to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula and to further strengthen the U.S.-South Korean alliance.,6
2002-12-20,gwb,President-elect Roh accepted President Bush's invitation to visit Washington at his earliest convenience.,5
2002-12-20,gwb,"In the meantime, the President and the President-elect discussed the possibility of sending senior representatives to each other's capitals to address issues of mutual concern.",8
2002-12-20,gwb,The President and the President-elect exchanged warm holiday greetings to each other and to the families of both nations and people.,6
2002-12-20,gwb,"The President, after that, had his usual round of intelligence briefings this morning, followed by FBI briefing.",4
2002-12-20,gwb,Then he convened a meeting of the National Security Council.,4
2002-12-20,gwb,"The President, as we speak, is having his regular lunch with the Vice President.",4
2002-12-20,gwb,"And then this afternoon the President looks forward to meeting with the Quartet, a group of leaders to discuss the path of making progress in the Middle East.",9
2002-12-20,gwb,"The President remains firmly committed to his position that a two-state solution of an Israel that can live in security, along with a state of Palestine side by side is the only viable solution to find lasting peace in the Middle East.",14
2002-12-20,gwb,"And finally, I'd like to read a statement by the President: I respect the very difficult decision Trent has made on behalf of the American people.",7
2002-12-20,gwb,"As Majority and Minority Leader of the Senate, Trent Lott improved education for the American people; he led the way in securing tax relief; he strengthened our national security; and he stood for a bold and effective foreign policy.",8

2004-06-28,gwb,"SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good morning, everybody.",1
2004-06-28,gwb,"I will start by discussing -- obviously, you received the news by now.",4
2004-06-28,gwb,"So as the President has said, and as the administration has said going back over the course of the last several weeks, and particularly after the new Iraqi government was formed, that our goal was to move as quickly as possible to enable the new Iraqi government to assume as much responsibility for the day-to-day affairs of the Iraqi people as possible.",10
2004-06-28,gwb,"We also said that we expected the enemy in Iraq to continue to try to inflict harm and violence on innocent Iraqi civilians, as well as the multinational forces on the ground.",7
2004-06-28,gwb,"As you have witnessed, and as the world has witnessed, the new Iraqi government has moved at warp-speed in taking control of its own government.",6
2004-06-28,gwb,"The ministries were being handed over on a very robust pace, based upon their capabilities.",4
2004-06-28,gwb,"Thursday of last week, they assumed control of the last ministry, so all the ministries, as of last Thursday, were under the operational control and day-to-day affairs of the new Iraqi government.",6
2004-06-28,gwb,"Prime Minister Allawi, himself, has demonstrated his capabilities as the new Iraqi leader in charge of this government, his determination to fight the terrorist enemy within his country, and his eagerness to assume control of his control in order to improve the lives of the Iraqi people, as well as to continue to fight the terrorist threat within his country.",10
2004-06-28,gwb,The administration has been in communication with Baghdad for several days -- I would say over a week -- about the concept or the idea of handing sovereignty over ahead of schedule.,8
2004-06-28,gwb,"This was based upon two factors, one, were they ready, and, B, taking into consideration the security environment in the country.",6
2004-06-28,gwb,Prime Minister Allawi strongly advised us that today would be the right day to do it.,4
2004-06-28,gwb,"He made a final decision last night, based on my understanding, and which was communicated, obviously, to Ambassador Bremer, which was then communicated to the administration.",7
2004-06-28,gwb,The President was informed during the day that these conversations were going on.,5
2004-06-28,gwb,"Obviously, he knew about the possibility of this happening for several days, but he received confirmation that Prime Minister Allawi was making the recommendation to do so ahead of schedule.",8
2004-06-28,gwb,"And the main reason that Prime Minister Allawi gave is that he believes it would strengthen his hand in dealing with the terrorist threat in his country and that it would demonstrate to the Iraqi people that the -- and to the world, that this new government is capable, willing, and ready to run their country, to improve the daily lives of the Iraqi people, and to improve the security environment in their country.",10
2004-06-28,gwb,"So the President was pleased with the news, because it does demonstrate that this new Iraqi government was ahead of schedule and fully capable of taking charge, that it shows a seriousness of the new Iraqi government has in focusing on the terrorist threat.",8
2004-06-28,gwb,"As many of you know, this -- the multinational forces, in particular our forces, are in Iraq to help them fight this enemy.",4
2004-06-28,gwb,"That relationship was borne out and the agreements made between the Iraqi government and the new -- and the multinational force, also memorialized in the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed.",6
2004-06-28,gwb,"As we talked about the deliberations today, the international community, once again, is demonstrating its support and commitment to the new Iraqi government by providing training of security forces through the NATO Alliance.",6
2004-06-28,gwb,"So these are positive developments, and today's news is great news for the Iraqi people.",5
2004-06-28,gwb,And President Bush is pleased with the work and sacrifice made by all those members of the coalition who have helped bring this day about.,12
2004-06-28,gwb,"He is particularly thankful, and thankful on behalf of a grateful nation, of the work of Ambassador Bremer, who has, through his tireless work, has helped make the daily lives of the Iraqi people better.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,The James S. Brady Briefing Room 4:10 P.M. EDT DR. RICE: Good afternoon.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,I'm going to give you a chronology of the events that occurred during the spring and summer of 2001.,9
2002-05-16,gwb,But I want to start with a little definitional work.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,"When we talk about threats, they come in many varieties.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,Very often we have uncorroborated information; sometimes we have corroborated but very general information.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"But I can tell you that it is almost never the case that we have information that is specific as to time, place, or method of attack.",12
2002-05-16,gwb,"In the period starting in December 2000, the intelligence community started reporting increase in traffic concerning terrorist activities.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"In the April-May time frame, there was specific threat reporting about al Qaeda attacks against U.S. targets or interest that might be in the works.",10
2002-05-16,gwb,"Now, there was a clear concern that something was up, that something was coming, but it was principally focused overseas.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"The areas of those concern were the Middle East, the Arabian Peninsula, and Europe.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"In the June time frame, arrests for the Millennium plot, there was testimony by the participants in the Millennium plot that Abu Zabeda had said that there might be interest in attacking the United States.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,And this comes out of testimony that was there as a result of the Millennium plot.,9
2002-05-16,gwb,"And then in June -- on June 26th, there was a threat spike, and as a result, again focusing overseas, the State Department issued a worldwide caution.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"Again, that was June 26th, and you probably remember that caution.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"Now, the FAA was also concerned of threats to U.S. citizens such as airline hijackings, and therefore, issued an information circular -- and an information circular goes out the private carriers from law enforcement -- saying that we have a concern.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,That was a June 22nd information circular.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,"At the end of June, there was a status of threat and action meeting that the -- what we call the Counterterrorism Security Group -- it is a group that is interagency that meets on the direction of an NSC Special Assistant, Dick Clarke at that time.",11
2002-05-16,gwb,"There was a meeting of that, and Dick Clarke reported to me that steps were being taken by the CSG.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"On July 2nd, as a result of some of that work, the FBI released a message saying that there are threats to be worried about overseas, but we cannot -- while we cannot foresee attacks domestically, we cannot rule them out.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,"This is an inlet, and again, an inlet goes out to law enforcement from the FBI.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"On July 2nd, the FAA issued another IC, saying that Ressam -- again associated with the Millennium plot -- said that there was an intention of using explosives in an airport terminal.",9
2002-05-16,gwb,This was a very specific IC.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"On July 5th, the threat reporting had become sufficiently robust, though not, again, very specific, but sufficiently robust, there was a lot of chatter in the system, that in his morning meeting the President asked me to go back and to see what was being done about all of the chatter that was there.",10
2002-05-16,gwb,"Andy Card and I met that afternoon with Dick Clarke, and Dick Clarke informed us that he had already had a meeting of the CSG core group and that he was holding another meeting that afternoon that would be focused on threats, and that would bring the domestic agencies into the CSG.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"On July 6th, the CSG core players met again because there was concern about -- very high concern about potential attacks in Paris, Turkey, Rome, and they acted to go so far as to suspend non-essential travel of U.S. counterterrorism staff.",10
2002-05-16,gwb,"So this is a period in which, again, attacks -- potential attacks overseas were heightened enough that there was almost daily meeting now, sometimes twice a day, of either the CSG or its subgroups.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"Contingency planning was done on how to deal with multiple, simultaneous attacks around the world.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"The period in mid-July was a point of another major threat spike, and it all related to the G-8 summit that was coming up.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"And in fact, there was specific threat information about the President.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"There was a lot of work done with liaison services abroad; in fact, the CIA went on what I think you would call a full-court press to try and deal with these potential attacks, and indeed, managed through these intelligence activities and liaison activities to disrupt attacks in Paris, Turkey and Rome.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,"On July 18th, the FAA issued another IC, saying that there were ongoing terrorist threats overseas, and that although there were no specific threats directed at civil aviation, they told the airlines, ""we urge you to use the highest level of caution.""",9
2002-05-16,gwb,"On July 18th also, the FBI issued another inlet on the Millennium plot conviction, reiterating its July 2nd message saying we're concerned about threats as a result of the Millennium plot conviction.",11
2002-05-16,gwb,"At the end of July, the FAA issued another IC, which said, there's no specific target, no credible info of attack to U.S. civil aviation interests, but terror groups are known to be planning and training for hijackings, and we ask you, therefore, to urge -- to use caution.",11
2002-05-16,gwb,"Throughout July and August, several times a week, there were meetings of the CSG, reviewing information at hand.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"There was no specific new information that came in in that period of time after the end of July and sort of in August, leading up to September.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,But the agencies were still at a heightened state of alert.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,Particularly overseas.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"I think the military actually had dropped its state of alert, but everybody was still on a heightened state of alert.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"On August 1st, the FBI issued another inlet on the upcoming third East Africa bombing anniversary, and again reiterated the message that had been in the July 2nd inlet.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"Now, on August 6th, the President received a presidential daily briefing which was not a warning briefing, but an analytic report.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"This analytic report, which did not have warning information in it of the kind that said, they are talking about an attack against so forth or so on, it was an analytic report that talked about UBL's methods of operation, talked about what he had done historically, in 1997, in 1998.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,"It mentioned hijacking, but hijacking in the traditional sense, and in a sense, said that the most important and most likely thing was that they would take over an airliner, holding passengers and demand the release of one of their operatives.",11
2002-05-16,gwb,"And the blind sheikh was mentioned by name as -- even though he's not an operative of al Qaeda, but as somebody who might be bargained in this way.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"I want to reiterate, it was not a warning.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"There was no specific time, place or method mentioned.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"What you have seen in the run-up that I've talked about is that the FAA was reacting to the same kind of generalized information about a potential hijacking as a method that al Qaeda might employ, but no specific information saying that they were planning such an attack at a particular time.",12
2002-05-16,gwb,"There is one other FAA IC in this period, issued on August 16th, where the FAA issued an IC on disguised weapons.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"They were concerned about some reports that the terrorists had made breakthroughs in cell phones, key chains and pens as weapons.",9
2002-05-16,gwb,"There are a number of other ICs that were also issued; we don't think they were germane to this, but I'm sure you can get the full record of all of the ICs that were released from Transportation.",11
2002-05-16,gwb,"I want to reiterate that during this time, the overwhelming bulk of the evidence was that this was an attack that was likely to take place overseas.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,"The State Department, the Defense Department were on very high states of alert.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,The embassies were -- have very clear protocols on how to button up; so does the military.,5
2002-05-16,gwb,That was done.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"But at home, while there was much less reporting or chatter at home, people were thinking about the U.S. and the FBI was involved in a number of investigations of potential al Qaeda personnel operating in the United States.",11
2002-05-16,gwb,"And that's my opening, and I'll take questions.",2
2002-05-16,gwb,Ron.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,Q Why didn't the American public know about these facts before they got on planes in the summer and fall of last year?,6
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: It is always, as you've learned since September 11th, a question of how good the information is and whether or not putting the information out is a responsible thing to do.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,I've emphasized that this was the most generalized kind of information.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,"There was no time, there was no place, there was no method of attack.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"It simply said, these are people who train and seem to talk possibly about hijackings -- that you would have risked shutting down the American civil aviation system with such generalized information.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,"I think you would have had to think five, six, seven times about that very, very hard.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"Steps were taken, and I'm sure security steps were taken.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"But you have to realize that when you're dealing with something this general, there's a limit to the amount that you can do.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q What security steps -- DR. RICE: Again, the FAA asked security personnel, ground personnel to have a heightened state of alert because there were tensions in the Middle East -- Q -- in any security -- DR. RICE: There were tensions in the Middle East that were leading to terrorists who had sympathies with those Middle East events.",0
2002-05-16,gwb,"There were various trials going on, and it was the association with all that was going on that said, look, these are people who talk from time to time about -- and train for hijacking; you should take a look at your security procedures and try to respond.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,But this was very generalized information.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Specifically, after this August 6th analytic report briefing that the President had, what did he do?",0
2002-05-16,gwb,What did other people in the administration do?,4
2002-05-16,gwb,What did he make of it?,2
2002-05-16,gwb,What action was taken?,2
2002-05-16,gwb,And why didn't he ever tell the American people about it?,2
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: Well, the action was being taken, because, if you notice, what is briefed to him in kind of a summary way -- and I should say, he had said to his briefer, I'd like you from time to time to give me summaries of what you know about potential attacks.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"And this was an analytic piece that tried to bring together several threads -- in 1997, they talked about this; in 1998, they talked about that; it's been known that maybe they want to try and release the blind Sheikh -- I mean, that was the character of it.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,"And so the actions were being taken in response to the generalized information that was being reported here, too.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,And the President was aware that there were ongoing efforts that were being taken.,5
2002-05-16,gwb,Q -- any specific information just prior to August 6th that raised concerns about hijacking of U.S. planes?,8
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: Again, this was generalized information that put together the fact that there were terrorist groups who were unhappy about things that were going on in the Middle East, as well as al Qaeda operatives, which we'd been watching for a long time -- that there was more chatter than usual, and that we knew that they were people who might try a hijacking.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"But, you know, again, that terrorism and hijacking might be associated is not rocket science.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Why shouldn't this be seen as an intelligence failure, that you were unable to predict something happening here?",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: Steve, I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon; that they would try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,All of this reporting about hijacking was about traditional hijacking.,5
2002-05-16,gwb,"You take a plane -- people were worried they might blow one up, but they were mostly worried that they might try to take a plane and use it for release of the blind Sheikh or some of their own people.",13
2002-05-16,gwb,"But I think that there's always a fine balance, but even in retrospect, even in hindsight, there was nothing in what was briefed to the President that would suggest that you would go out and say to the American people, look, I just read that terrorists might hijack and aircraft.",9
2002-05-16,gwb,"They talk about hijacking an aircraft once in a while, but have no specifics about when, where, under what circumstances.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,David.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Condi, this analytic report that the President received sounds like it wasn't his ordinary morning brief.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,Was it something that he had requested because of the various elements that had come up?,6
2002-05-16,gwb,Was it something you had requested?,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"And just to follow up on Terry's point here, was the hijacking mentioned here based on any new intelligence that had been developed between these meetings that you mentioned in the July 5th-6th time frame, or was it simply -- did it come out of the Philippines experience?",12
2002-05-16,gwb,DR. RICE: It was actually summarizing the kind of intelligence that they'd been acting on.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,I think it's a little strong to actually call it intelligence -- the interpretation that was there that these were people who might try hijacking.,6
2002-05-16,gwb,"It was -- very often as a part of his normal brief, David, he will get things that have been prepared for him because he's asked for a specific kind of document.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,"And as I said, he frequently says, you know, I'd like to see everything you know about X; or I'd like you to summarize -- because, as you can imagine, you get intelligence in little snippets, it's helpful from time to time to put it together.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,Q And did this also include then the unified FBI findings?,0
2002-05-16,gwb,"Of course, the Phoenix memo had been through the FBI in July -- did it include concerns about Moussaoui?",4
2002-05-16,gwb,And how much did this bring in the other agencies?,2
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: This did not include the issues that you just talked about, it did not.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,Q Was that a failure to your mind?,4
2002-05-16,gwb,Should it have?,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: Look, let me just speak to the Moussaoui and the so-called Phoenix memorandum.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"As you might imagine, a lot of things are prepared within agencies; they're distributed internally, they're worked internally.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,It's unusual that anything like that would get to the President.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,"He doesn't recall seeing anything, I don't recall seeing anything of this kind.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,Q On Phoenix or on Moussaoui -- DR. RICE: On either.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,Prior to September 11th.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,But I've asked George Tenet and I've asked Bob Mueller and I've asked my own people to spend some time really going in depth and seeing whether or not it was possible that it got to the President.,10
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Condi, officials who are familiar with the President's briefing have suggested that the information about hijackings was so vague and so general that you could read it from the podium without any danger to sources and methods.",9
2002-05-16,gwb,Could you read us those couple of lines about hijackings?,5
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: I'm not going to read you the couple of lines, but I will tell you, Jim, that it was very vague.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,The one piece that had any texture at all was that it might be for the purpose of freeing an operative like the blind Sheikh.,9
2002-05-16,gwb,"But again, most of what people were acting on was these were terrorist groups who were dissatisfied.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"We had reasons to believe that there was more chatter, more talk of attacks.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,Hijackings seemed one possibility.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,"They train and seemed to be interested in that, but nothing more specific than that.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,Q I've been led to believe that hijacking was actually a minor part of that briefing.,6
2002-05-16,gwb,You're suggesting it was an analytical look at all of the kinds of things that al Qaeda was considering and working on?,11
2002-05-16,gwb,DR. RICE: I would say that most of it was actually historical.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"It was not a catalogue of, they might use this, they might use this, they might use this, they might use that.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,That was not the character.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,"But it was mostly historical, going back to things that happened in '97, things that happened in '98, kind of methods of operation in the embassy bombings, might they return to some of those methods.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,It was that kind of thing.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q So, two questions.",0
2002-05-16,gwb,"No discussion at all then in this analytical briefing about either the information during the investigation in the Philippines about possibly flying a plane into the CIA building, or the investigation overseas about possibly flying a plane into the Eiffel Tower?",9
2002-05-16,gwb,No analytical information discussing those options at all?,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"And, B, you know that you would not be here today if it weren't eight months after the attack we hear for the first time that, even in a general sense, the word ""hijacking"" and ""al Qaeda"" was before the President prior to September 11th.",12
2002-05-16,gwb,"Why is it that in all the questioning of administration officials -- the President, the Vice President, yourself and others, did you have any hint, did you have any clue, that nobody simply said, you know, we didn't; there was this general talk once of hijacking, but we looked into it, it had nothing to do with this, there was no connection?",13
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: John, this all came out as a result of our preparations to help the committees on the Hill that are getting ready to review the events.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"It wasn't -- frankly, it didn't pop to the front of people's minds, because it's one report among very, very many that you get.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,And so it's out of that review that it became clear that this was there.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,"I will say that, again, hijacking before 9/11 and hijacking after 9/11 do mean two very, very different things.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"And so focusing on it before 9/11 -- perhaps it's clear that after 9/11 you would have looked at this differently, but certainly not before 9/11.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q And no discussion in this briefing, or any others, about the possibility of al Qaeda hijacking, and the fact that there have been active investigations into the possibility of a CIA building plot, or an Eiffel Tower plot.",0
2002-05-16,gwb,Never came up?,1
2002-05-16,gwb,DR. RICE: It did not come up.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Was that an intelligence failure, that nobody said, you know, there has been talk about doing this elsewhere?",6
2002-05-16,gwb,DR. RICE: We knew that there were -- that there were discussions of hijacking.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,We knew that there were -- that they had thought about hijackings in a number of places.,6
2002-05-16,gwb,"But, again, the information that was there in the PDB, which is the reference point here, was not about those activities.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,Q When did the White House hear about the Phoenix memorandum?,4
2002-05-16,gwb,You said it was before -- not before September 11th.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,When did you finally hear about the Phoenix memorandum?,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: No, what I said -- let me be very clear, because we're going to be certain of our facts here.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"And as you might imagine, it takes a little time to make sure of the facts.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"Neither the President, nor I have recollection of ever hearing about the Phoenix memo in the time prior to September 11th.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"We've asked FBI, CIA, our own people, to go back and see whether or not it's possible that it somehow came to him.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,I personally became aware of it just recently.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q And the second question, Dr. Rice.",0
2002-05-16,gwb,"Many members of Congress, of both parties, are expressing some anger or saying they weren't informed about these briefings, or intelligence readings, or whatever was being held in the White House in August and September.",9
2002-05-16,gwb,Was that a valid point in July and August?,4
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: Well, the general threat information of the kind that I've been talking about -- heightened sense of alert, concerns that al Qaeda might be plotting something, particularly, overseas -- it is my understanding that on a regular basis, the intelligence committees were told about the concerns of the intelligence agencies about these kinds of activities.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"Again, this is principally -- these were all principally pretty general, with the exception I think of the overseas threat that had to do with the G-8, which was more specific than anything else that we had.",14
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Dr. Rice, can you tell us whether you had conversations with Mr. Clarke expressly about what the potential impact on American commercial aviation would be in the event of a hijacking and the taking of hostages?",10
2002-05-16,gwb,You said earlier that the impact could have been extraordinary.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,Could you elaborate?,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"And what did you and Mr. Clarke discuss as to -- DR. RICE: I'm sorry, that it could have been extraordinary?",4
2002-05-16,gwb,Q That you'd considered issuing a warning.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: No, I didn't say that.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"I said, you always have to consider whether or not from some incredibly general information you want to try and issue a warning, because this was very, very general information.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,I don't think we ever thought a warning made sense in this context.,5
2002-05-16,gwb,"It was not like post 9/11, when even then people have said, well, you issued a really general warning, what are people supposed to do?",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"In the pre 9/11 period, we really never even considered issuing a warning.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"I was saying that if it had been considered, you would have had to consider very carefully what kind of impact you would have.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,But it was actually never considered.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,What was done was to get the FAA in the room so that they could do the things that they thought appropriate under these circumstances.,7
2002-05-16,gwb,Q Did you meet directly with -- DR. RICE: I did not.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Going back to the August 6th briefing that he had, that's the very first time that the President hears both the term hijacking and UBL together.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,Did he respond at all?,2
2002-05-16,gwb,"And secondly, were those two linked in any way in briefings that he got after that, until September 11th?",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: Well, there are a couple of other times that hijacking and terrorism are mentioned in this -- Q How many?",1
2002-05-16,gwb,DR. RICE: I think a couple.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"I mean, it's not -- it doesn't feature prominently in the reporting, because again, it was not based on information that they were planning a particular hijacking at a particular point in time.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,"Certainly nothing like we were looking at that there might be attacks against the G-8 leadership, there might be attacks against the President.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,It might be in Rome.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,A lot of chatter around Rome.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,Nothing like that.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,This was an analytic piece about methods that they had available to them.,7
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q As a follow-up to that, between August 6th and September 11th, this was somehow kept on the President's plate, in front of the President a bit.",0
2002-05-16,gwb,"Was it kept on your plate, as well?",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: Certainly what was -- first of all, kept on the plate of the agencies was that a number of these ICs were still in force.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,So there was a continued alert level.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,"As I've said, the one place where I think we've determined that there was a lowering of alert level was the military came down kind of one-half level.",8
2002-05-16,gwb,"As you know, it's very hard for them to stay on extremely high alert.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,We continued to monitor and follow this.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"There are threat conferences, threat warning conferences, meetings of the CSG, civets, as we call them, by teleconference several times a week.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,And that continued in this period.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,But there was no new information that suggested something more was afoot.,5
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Dr. Rice, there are a lot of widows and widowers and family members of the victims of September 11th who are listening to this, and thinking today that the government let them down, that there were intelligence failures.",9
2002-05-16,gwb,"As the person who is supposed to connect the dots with the NSC for the President, what would you like to say to them today?",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: This government did everything that it could in a period in which the information was very generalized, in which there was nothing specific to which to react.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"And had this President known of something more specific, or known that a plane was going to be used as a missile, he would have acted on it.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"But the fact is, this, in retrospect even, looks hard to put together.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"At the time, we were looking at something very different.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"To the degree that hijacking was an issue, it was traditional hijacking.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"The threats -- al Qaeda -- you know, you did have the FBI actively pursuing leads and trying to run this down.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,You did get the disruption of attacks in Rome and Paris and in Turkey.,6
2002-05-16,gwb,"But this President, who takes extremely seriously the security of the United States, was doing everything that he could in this period, as were the rest of the public servants in this government.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Dr. Rice, I'd like to know a little bit more about the August 6th meeting.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,It was at the ranch.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,Were you there?,1
2002-05-16,gwb,And was the analytic report the only subject discussed in the briefing?,5
2002-05-16,gwb,"Was it an oral presentation, was it a document?",3
2002-05-16,gwb,How lengthy was the document?,2
2002-05-16,gwb,Was there only one mention of hijacking in that document?,6
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: It is a document, Judy.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,There were other things briefed that day.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,I don't actually know what they were.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,The President's daily briefing is usually several briefings on various subjects.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,"I was here in Washington, not in Crawford, but I did talk with the -- I always talk to the President immediately after his briefings.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,The President and I talked all the time during this period of time about al Qaeda.,5
2002-05-16,gwb,"He was particularly concerned not just about threats to -- that they might be threatening us, but how we went after them.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,And so there was a lot of work going on in this entire period also to try and put together a strategy to bring them down.,7
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q How long was the document, and was there, in fact, only one sentence that mentioned hijacking?",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: The word, ""hijacking"" is mentioned once in the specific way that I've talked about and one other time kind of in summary.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,It's a page and a half document.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,Q You said that all of this came out as you prepared documents for upcoming committee hearings.,6
2002-05-16,gwb,"Was this a document that you had intended would get out in the public forum of committee hearings, or had you asked them to keep it classified?",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: We had not made any determination as to what documents were going forward, the nature of that.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,We're working with the committee right now to try to make sure that they have access to the information.,8
2002-05-16,gwb,"I mean, after all, it is important that the full story get out there.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,The American people deserve that; the administration wants that.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,And we are working with the committee on these documents.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,Q Had this document actually gone to Capitol Hill?,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: I don't know the answer to that, John.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"I don't think so -- no, this document had not.",2
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Dr. Rice, when the information was passed on from the FAA to the airline carriers, did any of that information include specifically a reference to al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden?",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"Because terrorists are terrorists, but this group obviously was viewed even by the government as a more serious threat.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"Did those warnings -- were they specific enough to say, not just worry about hijacks, or worry about terrorist hijacking, but did they say bin Laden?",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: We were worried about al Qaeda, and al Qaeda was clearly at the top of the heap.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,But there were other terrorist organizations that we were also worried about in this period of time.,7
2002-05-16,gwb,"The EIJ, for instance, because it was -- the blind Sheikh's organization was that organization.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"So I think that what you saw was that the concern about terrorism, or about terrorists, was actually broader than just al Qaeda.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,Al Qaeda was one of organization that might use this particular method.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,"So it said ""terrorist.""",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Dr. Rice, forgive me, this page and a half document on August 6th, I know you say it was non-specific, and I know you say it's a compendium and an analytical report -- how can you say it wasn't a warning?",6
2002-05-16,gwb,Are you not telling the President that there's danger ahead?,2
2002-05-16,gwb,DR. RICE: No.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"A warning -- there was nothing that said this is going to happen, or this might happen.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"It said, this is a method that these people might be considering.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,That was the nature of this.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,And it was very non-specific.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,"In the sense that -- you know, if -- going again, comparing it to what we were seeing, for instance, on the G-8, this was an analytic piece that looked at methods that they might use.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,Everybody knew that terrorists and hijacking have been associated -- for time immemorial.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,And how many hijackings have there been by terrorists?,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"In that sense, there was nothing really new here.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"And in fact, since it was mentioned a couple of other times that there might be hijackings -- again, non-specific -- I think it would be very hard to characterize this as a warning.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Dr. Rice, are you aware of the reports at the time that -- was in Washington on September 11th, and on September 10th, $100,000 was wired to Pakistan to this group here in this area?",9
2002-05-16,gwb,While he was here meeting with you or anybody in the administration?,6
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: I have not seen that report, and he was certainly not meeting with me.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q Dr. Rice, on the issue of connecting the dots, you talked about a number of things here -- the possibility of a CIA building, the Eiffel Tower, Moussaoui, Phoenix, all those other dots that are out there.",10
2002-05-16,gwb,Where do you think those dots should have come together?,3
2002-05-16,gwb,Should the briefer who prepared the document for the President have known about all those things?,6
2002-05-16,gwb,Is there a place where this should have come together?,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: Well, I think that one of the important questions is how we go forward, organizationally, to deal with some scenes.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"And I thought Director Mueller's testimony yesterday to this effect, that called for reorganization that would cause great fusion of intelligence from different sources, and particularly from domestic and foreign sources, is probably right.",9
2002-05-16,gwb,"But let me just say, we've already begun to make some of those changes.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,There is an Office of Homeland Security.,4
2002-05-16,gwb,And I think that's an important change.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"Secondly, every day now, in the morning, the President sits with the Vice President, with Andy Card, with me, with George Tenet, with Bob Mueller, and with Tom Ridge -- and often with John Ashcroft -- and there's a kind of fusion going on at the top.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,And the challenge is going to be to build down into the system that same kind of bringing together of information.,7
2002-05-16,gwb,And I think that's what Bob Mueller and George Tenet and others are looking at.,5
2002-05-16,gwb,And it's one reason that we have every reason to want to look at -- fully at what happened.,6
2002-05-16,gwb,Q On the G-8 plot -- could you just say something more about the G-8 plot?,0
2002-05-16,gwb,Wasn't that an airplane filled with explosives?,4
2002-05-16,gwb,Wasn't that plane -- DR. RICE: There were many different potential methods described concerning the G-8.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,Many.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,"The most troubling was not a specific method with a specific place, but specific targets, like the President.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"Q -- want to ask about, was there any link to bin Laden in those threats?",4
2002-05-16,gwb,And how serious did you take them?,2
2002-05-16,gwb,How specific were they?,2
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: We took the threats very seriously, because they were somewhat more specific.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"Again, when I say more specific, it didn't say, on July this date, at this place, at this time, so- and-so will happen.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"But there was greater texture, there was certainly more information.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"It's one reason that George Tenet went out of his way to, I would say, tell the agency to go to the ramparts out in the field, to really stir up our liaison services.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"And I think it was successful, because there were several disruptions.",3
2002-05-16,gwb,"Campbell, you have got the last question.",2
2002-05-16,gwb,Q I just want to go back to the issue of hijacking.,6
2002-05-16,gwb,"You said the FAA in July did issue a kind of warning or an alert of sorts to the airlines, saying that terror groups were planning or training for hijacking, did you not -- at the end of July?",9
2002-05-16,gwb,You were taking us through the time line.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,"I just want to be clear that, isn't it unusual that you would make the decision to bring the FAA into this?",6
2002-05-16,gwb,"That there was enough concern that hijackings would be a problem that you would say, you need to let the airlines know and -- DR. RICE: The FAA was one of only -- only one of the domestic agencies brought in.",6
2002-05-16,gwb,Customs was brought in; INS was brought in.,2
2002-05-16,gwb,So this was an effort to bring in domestic agencies that might have potential vulnerabilities.,6
2002-05-16,gwb,"But, again, let me read it, because it's extremely important, because, again, they were acting on general information, and therefore, the IC is very general.",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"And it says, ""The target is not clear"" -- this is July 31 -- ""The target is not clear.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,The FAA has no credible info to attack U.S. civil aviation interests.,5
2002-05-16,gwb,"Nevertheless, some of the current active groups are known to plan and train for hijackings.",4
2002-05-16,gwb,"FAA encourages all U.S. carriers to exercise prudence and demonstrate a high degree of alertness.""",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"So, again, the operative words here, that ""some of the current active groups are known to plan and train for,"" not, they're planning a particular hijacking.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,Q But you went through a list of these.,0
2002-05-16,gwb,"I mean, is it possible -- how do you get the airlines to pay attention to them, if you're putting them out periodically, and if it is something general like this, what do you really expect them to do?",5
2002-05-16,gwb,"DR. RICE: Well, the problem, as I was explaining when somebody asked me, why didn't we go public with some of these alerts -- or some of this information -- is that when you're dealing with very general information, all you can do is tell people it's very general.",1
2002-05-16,gwb,"And I -- you would have to refer to the Transportation Department and the FAA to get a better sense for what protocols are followed, or how this is all done.",7
2002-05-16,gwb,"But the FAA issued these ICs that, again, were based on very general information and were intended just to alert people that these were organizations that were angry, there was a lot of threat reporting about them, and hijacking was considered to be one of their methods.",9
2002-05-16,gwb,And that was the extent of it.,3
2002-05-16,gwb,Q What was the date of that IC you just read?,4
2002-05-16,gwb,DR. RICE: 31 July.,1
2002-05-16,gwb,Thank you.,1

2004-09-02,gwb,My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy.,6
2004-09-02,gwb,We now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods but new competition for our workers.,7

2004-09-02,gwb,"To create jobs, we will expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe.",4

2004-09-02,gwb,"Another drag on our economy is the current Tax Code, which is a complicated mess, filled with special interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than 6 billion hours of paperwork and headache every year.",7

2004-09-02,gwb,We will offer a tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them.,8
2004-09-02,gwb,"These accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to save tax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you change jobs.",6
2004-09-02,gwb,We will provide low-income Americans with better access to health care.,5
2004-09-02,gwb,"In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community or rural health center.",4

2004-09-02,gwb,"To make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now.",4
2004-09-02,gwb,"And in all we do to improve health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC.",7
2004-09-02,gwb,"In this time of change, Government must take the side of working families.",4
2004-09-02,gwb,"In a new term, we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time.",5
2004-09-02,gwb,Our laws should never stand in the way of a more family-friendly workplace.,6

2004-09-02,gwb,"Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America is at an alltime high.",4
2004-09-02,gwb,"Tonight we set a new goal: 7 million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say, ""Welcome to my home.""",8
2004-09-02,gwb,"In an ownership society, more people will own their health care plans and have the confidence of owning a piece of their retirement.",8
2004-09-02,gwb,We'll always keep the promise of Social Security for our older workers.,4
2004-09-02,gwb,"With the huge baby boom generation approaching retirement, many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will be there when they need it.",6
2004-09-02,gwb,"We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to save some of their taxes in a personal account, a nest egg you can call your own and Government can never take away.",7
2004-09-02,gwb,"In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a Government program but a path, a path to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life.",11

2004-09-02,gwb,"Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of Al Qaida; Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups; Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terrorist fundraising; Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons; Iraq was a gathering threat; and Al Qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks.",8
2004-09-02,gwb,"Today, the Government of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror; Pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders; Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests; Libya is dismantling its weapons programs; the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom; and more than three-quarters of Al Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed.",8
2004-09-02,gwb,We have led; many have joined; and America and the world are safer.,4
2004-09-02,gwb,"This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions.",3
2004-09-02,gwb,And the toughest came on Iraq.,2
2004-09-02,gwb,We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support for terror.,5
2004-09-02,gwb,"We knew his long history of pursuing, even using weapons of mass destruction.",5

2004-09-02,gwb,"In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat.",3
2004-09-02,gwb,"Members of both political parties, including Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his runningmate, saw the threat and voted to authorize the use of force.",9
2004-09-02,gwb,"We went to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm or face serious consequences.",9
2004-09-02,gwb,Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply.,4
2004-09-02,gwb,"After more than a decade of diplomacy, we gave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world.",5
2004-09-02,gwb,"He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office, a decision no President would ask for but must be prepared to make: Do I forget the lessons of September the 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country?",6
2004-09-02,gwb,"Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.",4
2004-09-02,gwb,"Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy is coming to the broader Middle East.",5
2004-09-02,gwb,"In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people, yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the October Presidential election, a resounding endorsement for democracy.",5

2004-09-02,gwb,"Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of harboring them, and that helps us keep the peace.",4
2004-09-02,gwb,So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies and move toward elections and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible.,8
2004-09-02,gwb,And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned.,4

2004-09-02,gwb,I proposed and the Congress overwhelmingly passed $87 billion in funding needed by our troops doing battle in Afghanistan and Iraq.,8
2004-09-02,gwb,My opponent and his runningmate voted against this money for bullets and fuel and vehicles and body armor.,6
2004-09-02,gwb,"When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it.""",4

2004-09-02,gwb,"Again, my opponent takes a different approach.",2
2004-09-02,gwb,"In the midst of war, he has called American allies, quote, ""a coalition of the coerced and the bribed.""",5
2004-09-02,gwb,"That would be nations like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others, allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician.",12

2002-05-20,gwb,Cuba's independence one century ago today was the inspiration of great thinkers such as Felix Varela.,6

2002-05-20,gwb,We know this.,1

2002-05-20,gwb,The United States has no designs on Cuban sovereignty.,4
2002-05-20,gwb,It's not a part of our strategy or a part of our vision.,5
2002-05-20,gwb,"In fact, the United States has been a strong and consistent supporter of freedom for the Cuban people.",6

2002-05-20,gwb,"In most elections, there has been one candidate, Castro's candidate.",4
2002-05-20,gwb,All elections in Castro's Cuba have been a fraud.,5
2002-05-20,gwb,"The voices of the Cuban people have been suppressed, and their votes have been meaningless.",4
2002-05-20,gwb,That's the truth.,2
2002-05-20,gwb,Es la verdad.,1
2002-05-20,gwb,"In the 2003 National Assembly elections in Cuba, Cuba has the opportunity to offer Cuban voters the substance of democracy, not its hollow, empty forms.",5
2002-05-20,gwb,"Opposition parties should have the freedom to organize, assemble, and speak, with equal access to all airwaves.",9
2002-05-20,gwb,All political prisoners must be released and allowed to participate in the election process.,5
2002-05-20,gwb,Human rights organizations should be free to visit Cuba to ensure that the conditions for free elections are being created.,8
2002-05-20,gwb,And the 2003 elections should be monitored by objective outside observers.,3
2002-05-20,gwb,These are the minimum steps necessary to make sure that next year's elections are the true expression of the will of the Cuban people.,11
2002-05-20,gwb,"I also challenge Cuba's Government to ease its stranglehold, to change its stranglehold on private economic activity.",5
2002-05-20,gwb,"Political and economic freedoms go hand in hand, and if Cuba opens its political system, fundamental questions about its backward economic system will come into sharper focus.",5
2002-05-20,gwb,"If the Cuban Government truly wants to advance the cause of workers, of Cuban workers, surely it will permit trade unions to exist outside of Government control.",8
2002-05-20,gwb,"If Cuba wants to create more good-paying jobs, private employers have to be able to negotiate with and pay workers of their own choosing, without the Government telling who they can hire and who they must fire.",9
2002-05-20,gwb,"If Cuba wants to attract badly needed investment from abroad, property rights must be respected.",5
2002-05-20,gwb,"If the Government wants to improve the daily lives of its people, goods and services produced in Cuba should be made available to all Cuban citizens.",8
2002-05-20,gwb,"Workers employed by foreign companies should be paid directly by their employers, instead of having the Government seize their hard-currency wages and pass on a pittance in the form of pesos.",8
2002-05-20,gwb,"And the signs at hotels reading ""Solamente Turistas"" should finally be taken down.",6
2002-05-20,gwb,"Without major steps by Cuba to open up its political system and its economic system, trade with Cuba will not help the Cuban people.",6
2002-05-20,gwb,"It's important for Americans to understand: Without political reform, without economic reform, trade with Cuba will merely enrich Fidel Castro and his cronies.",4
2002-05-20,gwb,"Well-intentioned ideas about trade will merely prop up this dictator, enrich his cronies, and enhance the totalitarian regime.",4
2002-05-20,gwb,It will not help the Cuban people.,2
2002-05-20,gwb,"With real political and economic reform, trade can benefit the Cuban people and allow them to share in the progress of our times.",7
2002-05-20,gwb,"If Cuba's Government takes all the necessary steps to ensure that the 2003 elections are certifiably free and fair—certifiably free and fair—and if Cuba also begins to adopt meaningful market-based reforms, then and only then I will work with the United States Congress to ease the ban on trade and travel between our two countries.",7
2002-05-20,gwb,Meaningful reform on Cuba's part will be answered with a meaningful American response.,5
2002-05-20,gwb,The goal of the United States policy toward Cuba is not a permanent embargo on Cuba's economy.,5
2002-05-20,gwb,The goal is freedom for Cuba's people.,5
2002-05-20,gwb,Today's initiative invites the Cuban Government to trust and respect Cuban citizens.,4
2002-05-20,gwb,"And I urge other democracies, in this hemisphere and beyond, to use their influence on Cuba's Government to allow free and fair National Assembly elections and to push for real and meaningful and verifiable reform.",8
2002-05-20,gwb,"Full normalization of relations with Cuba—diplomatic recognition, open trade, and a robust aid program—will only be possible when Cuba has a new government that is fully democratic, when the rule of law is respected, and when the human rights of all Cubans are fully protected.",6
2002-05-20,gwb,"Yet, under the Initiative for a New Cuba, the United States recognizes that freedom sometimes grows step by step, and we'll encourage those steps.",5
2002-05-20,gwb,The current of history runs strongly toward freedom.,3
2002-05-20,gwb,"Our plan is to accelerate freedom's progress in Cuba in every way possible, just as the United States and our democratic friends and allies did successfully in places like Poland or in South Africa.",8
2002-05-20,gwb,"Even as we seek to end tyranny, we will work to make life better for people living under and resisting Castro's rule.",8
2002-05-20,gwb,Today I'm announcing a series of actions that will directly benefit the Cuban people and give them greater control of their economic and political destiny.,10
2002-05-20,gwb,My administration will ease restrictions on humanitarian assistance by legitimate U.S. religious and other nongovernmental organizations that directly serve the needs of the Cuban people and will help build Cuban civil society.,8
2002-05-20,gwb,And the United States will provide such groups with direct assistance that can be used for humanitarian and entrepreneurial activities.,7
2002-05-20,gwb,Our Government will offer scholarships in the United States for Cuban students and professionals who try to build independent civil institutions in Cuba and scholarships for family members of political prisoners.,8
2002-05-20,gwb,We are willing to negotiate direct mail service between the United States and Cuba.,6
2002-05-20,gwb,"My administration will also continue to look for ways to modernize Radio and TV Marti, because even the strongest walls of oppression cannot stand when the floodgates of information and knowledge are opened.",7
2002-05-20,gwb,"And in the months ahead, my administration will continue to work with leaders all around our country, leaders who love freedom for Cuba, to implement new ways to empower individuals to enhance the chance for freedom.",7
2002-05-20,gwb,The United States will continue to enforce economic sanctions on Cuba and the ban on travel to Cuba until Cuba's Government proves that it is committed to real reform.,7
2002-05-20,gwb,"We will continue to prohibit U.S. financing for Cuban purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, because this would just be a foreign aid program in disguise, which would benefit the current regime.",7
2002-05-20,gwb,"Today's initiative offers Cuba's Government a different path leading to a different future, a future of greater democracy and prosperity and respect.",9
2002-05-20,gwb,"With real reform in Cuba, our countries can begin chipping away at four decades of distrust and division.",6
2002-05-20,gwb,And the choice rests with Mr. Castro.,3
2002-05-20,gwb,"Today, there is only one nation in our hemisphere that is not a democracy—only one.",4
2002-05-20,gwb,There is only one national leader whose position of power owes more to bullets than ballots.,6
2002-05-20,gwb,Fidel Castro has a chance to escape this lonely and stagnant isolation.,5
2002-05-20,gwb,"If he accepts our offer, he can bring help to his people and hope to our relations.",4
2002-05-20,gwb,"If Mr. Castro refuses our offer, he will be protecting his cronies at the expense of his people.",5
2002-05-20,gwb,"And eventually, despite all his tools of oppression, Fidel Castro will need to answer to his people.",4
2002-05-20,gwb,"Jose Marti said, ""Barriers of ideas are stronger than barricades of stone.""",6
2002-05-20,gwb,"For the benefit of Cuba's people, it is time for Mr. Castro to cast aside old and failed ideas and to start to think differently about the future.",8
2002-05-20,gwb,"Today could mark a new dawn in a long friendship between our people, but only if the Castro regime sees the light.",5
2002-05-20,gwb,Cuba's independence was achieved a century ago.,3
2002-05-20,gwb,It was hijacked nearly half a century ago.,3
2002-05-20,gwb,"Yet, the independent spirit of the Cuban people has never faltered, and it has never been stronger than it is today.",4
2002-05-20,gwb,The United States is proud to stand with all Cubans and all Cuban Americans who love freedom.,7
2002-05-20,gwb,And we will continue to stand with you until liberty returns to the land you love so well.,7
2002-05-20,gwb,Viva Cuba Libre.,1
2001-12-13,gwb,Good morning.,1
2001-12-13,gwb,I've just concluded a meeting of my National Security Council.,4
2001-12-13,gwb,"We reviewed what I discussed with my friend President Vladimir Putin over the course of many meetings, many months.",6
2001-12-13,gwb,And that is the need for America to move beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.,6
2001-12-13,gwb,"Today I have given formal notice to Russia, in accordance with the treaty, that the United States of America is withdrawing from this almost 30-year-old treaty.",6
2001-12-13,gwb,I have concluded the ABM Treaty hinders our Government's ability to develop ways to protect our people from future terrorist or rogue state missile attacks.,9
2001-12-13,gwb,"The 1972 ABM Treaty was signed by the United States and the Soviet Union at a much different time, in a vastly different world.",4
2001-12-13,gwb,"One of the signatories, the Soviet Union, no longer exists, and neither does the hostility that once led both our countries to keep thousands of nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert, pointed at each other.",8
2001-12-13,gwb,"The grim theory was that neither side would launch a nuclear attack because it knew the other would respond, thereby destroying both.",5
2001-12-13,gwb,"Today, as the events of September the 11th made all too clear, the greatest threats to both our countries come not from each other or other big powers in the world but from terrorists who strike without warning or rogue states who seek weapons of mass destruction.",11
2001-12-13,gwb,We know that the terrorists and some of those who support them seek the ability to deliver death and destruction to our doorstep via missile.,7
2001-12-13,gwb,And we must have the freedom and the flexibility to develop effective defenses against those attacks.,7
2001-12-13,gwb,"Defending the American people is my highest priority as Commander in Chief, and I cannot and will not allow the United States to remain in a treaty that prevents us from developing effective defenses.",10
2001-12-13,gwb,"At the same time, the United States and Russia have developed a new, much more hopeful and constructive relationship.",4
2001-12-13,gwb,We are moving to replace mutually assured destruction with mutual cooperation.,4
2001-12-13,gwb,"Beginning in Ljubljana and continuing in meetings in Genoa, Shanghai, Washington, and Crawford, President Putin and I developed common ground for a new strategic relationship.",11
2001-12-13,gwb,Russia is in the midst of a transition to free markets and democracy.,7
2001-12-13,gwb,We are committed to forging strong economic ties between Russia and the United States and new bonds between Russia and our partners in NATO.,13
2001-12-13,gwb,NATO has made clear its desire to identify and pursue opportunities for joint action at 20.,8
2001-12-13,gwb,"I look forward to visiting Moscow to continue our discussions as we seek a formal way to express a new strategic relationship that will last long beyond our individual administrations, providing a foundation for peace for the years to come.",13
2001-12-13,gwb,We're already working closely together as the world rallies in the war against terrorism.,5
2001-12-13,gwb,I appreciate so much President Putin's important advice and cooperation as we fight to dismantle the Al Qaida network in Afghanistan.,5
2001-12-13,gwb,I appreciate his commitment to reduce Russia's offensive nuclear weapons.,5
2001-12-13,gwb,"I reiterate our pledge to reduce our own nuclear arsenal between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed strategic nuclear weapons.",5
2001-12-13,gwb,"President Putin and I have also agreed that my decision to withdraw from the treaty will not, in any way, undermine our new relationship or Russian security.",6
2001-12-13,gwb,"As President Putin said in Crawford, we are on the path to a fundamentally different relationship.",4
2001-12-13,gwb,The cold war is long gone.,2
2001-12-13,gwb,Today we leave behind one of its last vestiges.,5
2001-12-13,gwb,But this is not a day for looking back.,4
2001-12-13,gwb,"This is a day for looking forward with hope and anticipation of greater prosperity and peace for Russians, for Americans, and for the entire world.",10
2001-12-13,gwb,Thank you.,1
2002-07-09,gwb,Thank you all.,2
2002-07-09,gwb,Thank you very much for that warm welcome.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,I'm pleased to be back in New York City.,7
2002-07-09,gwb,New York City is a unique symbol of America's creativity and character and resilience.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,"In the last 10 months, New Yorkers have shown a watching world the true spirit of your city, a spirit that honors the loss, remembers its heroes, and goes forward with determination and with confidence.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"The people of this city are writing one of the greatest chapters in our Nation's history, and all Americans are proud of New York.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,I've come to the financial capital of the world to speak of a serious challenge to our financial markets and to the confidence on which they rest.,9
2002-07-09,gwb,The misdeeds now being uncovered in some quarters of corporate America are threatening the financial well-being of many workers and many investors.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,"At this moment, America's greatest economic need is higher ethical standards, standards enforced by strict laws and upheld by responsible business leaders.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,The lure of heady profits of the late 1990s spawned abuses and excesses.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,"With strict enforcement and higher ethical standards, we must usher in a new era of integrity in corporate America.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,I want to thank Bill for his introduction.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,There's nothing like being recycled.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,"But thanks for having me, and I'm honored to meet your family and Uncle Jack.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,I appreciate very much Secretary O'Neill and Secretary Evans traveling with me today.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,"I want to thank the members of the New York delegation, Senators Schumer and Clinton as well as Congressman Fossella and Congressman Rangel.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,I appreciate so very much the mayor—my friend the mayor for being here to greet me as I came in on the chopper.,9
2002-07-09,gwb,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thanks for the great job you're doing for New York.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,I'm honored that Cardinal Egan is here.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,"And I appreciate so very much seeing John Whitehead, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,And thank you all for coming as well.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,"The American economy, our economy, is built on confidence—the conviction that our free enterprise system will continue to be the most powerful and most promising in the world.",10
2002-07-09,gwb,That confidence is well-placed.,2
2002-07-09,gwb,"After all, American technology is the most advanced in the world.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,Our universities attract the talent of the world.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,Our workers and ranchers and farmers can compete with anybody in the world.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,"Our society rewards hard work and honest ambition, bringing people to our shores from all around the world who share those values.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,The American economy is the most creative and enterprising and productive system ever devised.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,We can be confident because America is taking every necessary step to fight and win the war on terror.,7
2002-07-09,gwb,We are reorganizing the Federal Government to protect the homeland.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,We are hunting down the terrorists who seek to sow chaos.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,My commitment and the commitment of our Government is total.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,"We will not relent until the coldblooded killers are found, disrupted, and defeated.",3
2002-07-09,gwb,We can be confident because of the amazing achievements of American workers and entrepreneurs.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,"In spite of all that happened last year, from the economic slowdown to the terrorist attack, worker productivity has grown by 4.2 percent over the last four quarters.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,"In the first quarter of 2002, the economy grew at an annual rate exceeding 6 percent.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"Though there's much work left to do, American workers have defied the pessimists and laid the foundation for a sustained recovery.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"We can be confident because we're pursuing pro-growth reforms in Washington, DC.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,"Last year we passed the biggest tax cut in a generation, which encouraged job creation and boosted consumer spending at just the right time.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"For the sake of long-term growth, I'm asking Congress to make the tax reductions permanent.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"I'm asking Congress to join me to promote free trade, which will open new markets and create better jobs and spur innovation.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,"I ask Congress to work with me to pass a terrorism insurance bill, to give companies the security they need to expand and to build.",8
2002-07-09,gwb,"And I will insist on—and if need be, enforce— discipline in Federal spending, so we can meet our national priorities without undermining our economy.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,We have much to be confident about in America.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,"Yet our economy and our country need one more kind of confidence, confidence in the character and conduct of all of our business leaders.",8
2002-07-09,gwb,"The American economy today is rising, while faith in the fundamental integrity of American business leaders is being undermined.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,"Nearly every week brings better economic news and a discovery of fraud and scandal, problems long in the making but now coming to light.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"We've learned of some business leaders obstructing justice and misleading clients, falsifying records, business executives breaching the trust and abusing power.",9
2002-07-09,gwb,"We've learned of CEOs earning tens of millions of dollars in bonuses just before their companies go bankrupt, leaving employees and retirees and investors to suffer.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,The business pages of American newspapers should not read like a scandal sheet.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,The vast majority of business men and women are honest.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,They do right by their employees and their shareholders.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,"They do not cut ethical corners, and their work helps create an economy which is the envy of the world.",8
2002-07-09,gwb,Yet high-profile acts of deception have shaken people's trust.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,Too many corporations seem disconnected from the values of our country.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,These scandals have hurt the reputations of many good and honest companies.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,They have hurt the stock market.,2
2002-07-09,gwb,"And worst of all, they are hurting millions of people who depend on the integrity of businesses for their livelihood and their retirement, for their peace of mind and their financial well-being.",10
2002-07-09,gwb,"When abuses like this begin to surface in the corporate world, it is time to reaffirm the basic principles and rules that make capitalism work, truthful books and honest people and well-enforced laws against fraud and corruption.",9
2002-07-09,gwb,"All investment is an act of faith, and faith is earned by integrity.",3
2002-07-09,gwb,"In the long run, there's no capitalism without conscience; there is no wealth without character.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,"And so again today I'm calling for a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business community, an ethic that will increase investor confidence, will make employees proud of their companies, and again regain the trust of the American people.",9
2002-07-09,gwb,"Our Nation's most respected business leaders, including many gathered here today, take this ethic very seriously.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"The Business Roundtable, the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ have all proposed guidelines to improve corporate conduct and transparency.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,"These include requirements that independent directors compose the majority of the company's board, that all members of audit, nominating, and compensation committees be independent, and that all stock option plans be approved by the shareholders.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,"I call on all the stock markets to adopt these sensible reforms, these commonsense reforms, as soon as possible.",3
2002-07-09,gwb,"Self-regulation is important, but it's not enough.",2
2002-07-09,gwb,Government cannot remove risk from investment—I know that—or chance from the market.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,"But Government can do more to promote transparency and ensure that risks are honest, and Government can ensure that those who breach the trust of the American people are punished.",8
2002-07-09,gwb,"Bold, well-considered reforms should demand integrity without stifling innovation and economic growth.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"From the antitrust laws of the 19th century to the S&L reforms of recent times, America has tackled financial problems when they appeared.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,The actions I'm proposing follow in this tradition and should be welcomed by every honest company in America.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,"First, we will use the full weight of the law to expose and root out corruption.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,"My administration will do everything in our power to end the days of cooking the books, shading the truth, and breaking our laws.",10
2002-07-09,gwb,"Today, by Executive order, I create a new Corporate Fraud Task Force, headed by the Deputy Attorney General, which will target major accounting fraud and other criminal activity in corporate finance.",8
2002-07-09,gwb,"The task force will function as a financial crimes SWAT team, overseeing the investigation of corporate abusers and bringing them to account.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,I'm also proposing tough new criminal penalties for corporate fraud.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,This legislation would double the maximum prison terms for those convicted of financial fraud from 5 to 10 years.,7
2002-07-09,gwb,"Defrauding investors is a serious offense, and the punishment must be as serious as the crime.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,I ask Congress to strengthen the ability of SEC investigators to temporarily freeze improper payments to corporate executives and to strengthen laws that prevent the destruction of corporate documents in order to hide crimes.,10
2002-07-09,gwb,"Second, we're moving corporate accounting out of the shadows, so the investing public will have a true and fair and timely picture of assets and liabilities and income of publicly traded companies.",8
2002-07-09,gwb,"Greater transparency will expose bad companies and, just as importantly, protect the reputations of the good ones.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"To expose corporate corruption, I asked Congress 4 months ago for funding to place 100 new enforcement personnel in the SEC.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,And I call on Congress to act quickly on this request.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,Today I announce my administration is asking Congress for an additional $100 million in the coming year to give the SEC the officers and the technology it needs to enforce the law.,8
2002-07-09,gwb,"If more scandals are hiding in corporate America, we must find and expose them now, so we can begin rebuilding the confidence of our people and the momentum of our markets.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"I've also proposed a 10-point accountability plan for American business, designed to provide better information to shareholders, set clear responsibility for corporate officers, and develop a stronger, more independent auditing system.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,This plan is ensuring that the SEC takes aggressive and affirmative action.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,Corporate officers who benefit from false accounting statements should forfeit all money gained by their fraud.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,An executive whose compensation is tied to his company's performance makes more money when his company does well.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,"That's fine, and that's fair when the accounting is aboveboard.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,"Yet when a company uses deception, deception accounting to hide reality, executives should lose all their compensation—all their compensation gained by the deceit.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,Corporate leaders who violate the public trust should never be given that trust again.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,The SEC should be able to punish corporate leaders who are convicted of abusing their powers by banning them from ever serving again as officers or directors of a publicly held corporation.,14
2002-07-09,gwb,"If an executive is guilty of outright fraud, resignation is not enough.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,Only a ban on serving at the top of another company will protect other shareholders and employees.,8
2002-07-09,gwb,My accountability plan also requires CEOs to personally vouch for their firms' annual financial statements.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,"Currently, a CEO signs a nominal certificate and does so merely on behalf of the company.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"In the future, the signature of the CEO should also be his or her personal certification of the veracity and fairness of the financial disclosures.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,"When you sign a statement, you're pledging your word, and you should stand behind it.",3
2002-07-09,gwb,"And because the shareholders of America need confidence in financial disclosures right away, the SEC has ordered the leaders of nearly 1,000 large public companies to certify that the financial information they submitted in the last year was fair and it was accurate.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,I've also called on the SEC to adopt new rules to ensure that auditors will be independent and not compromised by conflicts of interest.,8
2002-07-09,gwb,The House of Representatives has passed needed legislation to encourage transparency and accountability in American businesses.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,"The Senate also needs to act quickly and responsibly, so I can sign a good bill into law.",3
2002-07-09,gwb,"Third, my administration will guard the interests of small investor and pension holders.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"More than 80 million Americans own stock, and many of them are new to the market.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"Buying stock gives them an opportunity to build wealth over the long term, and this is the very kind of responsible investment we must promote in America.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"To encourage stock ownership, we must make sure that analysts give honest advice and pension plans treat workers fairly.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"Stock analysts should be trusted advisers, not salesmen with a hidden agenda.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,We must prevent analysts from touting weak companies because they happen to be clients of their own firm for underwriting or merger advice.,7
2002-07-09,gwb,"This is a flat-out conflict of interest, and we'll aggressively enforce new SEC rules against this practice, rules which take effect today.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,And the stock markets should make sure that the advice analysts give and the terms they use have real meaning to investors.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,"""Buy"" should not be the only word in an analyst's vocabulary, and they should never say ""hold"" when they really mean ""sell.""",5
2002-07-09,gwb,Small investors should also not have to have the deck stacked against them when it comes to managing their own retirement funds.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,"My pension reform proposal would treat corporate executives the same as workers during so-called blackout periods, when employees are prohibited from trading in their own accounts.",11
2002-07-09,gwb,What's fair for the workers is fair for the bosses.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,My reform proposal gives workers quarterly information about their investments.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,It expands workers' access to sound investment advice and allows them to diversify out of company stock.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,The House has passed these measures.,2
2002-07-09,gwb,I urge the Senate to do the same.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,Tougher laws and stricter requirements will help; it'll help.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,"Yet ultimately, the ethics of American business depend on the conscience of America's business leaders.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"We need men and women of character, who know the difference between ambition and destructive greed, between justified risk and irresponsibility, between enterprise and fraud.",12
2002-07-09,gwb,Our schools of business must be principled teachers of right and wrong and not surrender to moral confusion and relativism.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,"Our leaders of business must set high and clear expectations of conduct, demonstrated by their own conduct.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,Responsible business leaders do not jump ship during hard times.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,Responsible leaders do not collect huge bonus packages when the value of their company dramatically declines.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,"Responsible leaders do not take home tens of millions of dollars in compensation as their companies prepare to file for bankruptcy, devastating the holdings of their investors.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"Everyone in a company should live up to high standards, but the burden of leadership rightly belongs to the chief executive officer.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,CEOs set the ethical direction for their companies.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,"They set a moral tone by the decisions they make, the respect they show their employees, and their willingness to be held accountable for their actions.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,They set a moral tone by showing their disapproval of other executives who bring discredit to the business world.,9
2002-07-09,gwb,And one of the principal ways that CEOs set an ethical tone is through their compensation.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,The pay package sends a clear signal whether a business leader is committed to teamwork or personal enrichment.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,It tells you whether his principal goal is the creation of wealth for shareholders or the accumulation of wealth for himself.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,The SEC currently requires the annual disclosure of the CEO's compensation.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,"But that information is often buried in long proxy statement—proxy statements—and seldom seen, seldom seen by shareholders.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"I challenge every CEO in America to describe in the company's annual report, prominently and in plain English, details of his or her compensation package, including salary and bonus and benefits.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,"And the CEO, in that report, should also explain why his or her compensation package is in the best interest of the company he serves.",7
2002-07-09,gwb,Those who sit on corporate boards have responsibilities.,5
2002-07-09,gwb,"I urge board members to check the quality of their company's financial statements, to ask tough questions about accounting methods, to demand that audit firms are not beholden to the CEO, and to make sure the compensation for senior executives squares with reality and common sense.",12
2002-07-09,gwb,And I challenge compensation committees to put an end to all company loans to corporate officers.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,Shareholders also need to make their voices heard.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,They should demand an attentive and active board of directors.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,They should demand truly independent directors.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,"They should demand that compensation committees reward long-term success, not failure.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,"Shareholders should demand accountability not just in bad times but especially in boom times, when accountability frequently breaks down.",5
2002-07-09,gwb,"Shareholders are a company's most important constituency, and they should act like it.",3
2002-07-09,gwb,The 1990s was a decade of tremendous economic growth.,4
2002-07-09,gwb,"As we're now learning, it was also a decade when the promise of rapid profits allowed the seeds of scandal to spring up.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"A lot of money was made, but too often standards were tossed aside.",3
2002-07-09,gwb,Yet the American system of enterprise has not failed us.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,Some dishonest individuals have failed our system.,2
2002-07-09,gwb,"Now comes the urgent work of enforcement and reform, driven by a new ethic of responsibility.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"We will show that markets can be both dynamic and honest, that lasting wealth and prosperity are built on a foundation of integrity.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"By reasserting the best values of our country, we will reclaim the promise of our economy.",6
2002-07-09,gwb,"Leaders in this room help give the free enterprise system an ethical compass, and the Nation respects you for that.",4
2002-07-09,gwb,We need that influence now more than ever.,3
2002-07-09,gwb,I want to thank you for helping to restore the people's trust in American business.,8
2002-07-09,gwb,I want to thank you for your love of the country.,6
2002-07-09,gwb,And I want to thank you for giving me the chance to come and address you today.,7
2002-07-09,gwb,May God bless you all.,2
2005-06-10,gwb,President Bush.,1
2005-06-10,gwb,It's my honor to welcome the President of our very close ally to the Oval Office.,6
2005-06-10,gwb,I'll have a statement; the President will have a statement.,3
2005-06-10,gwb,Then I'll answer two questions from the American press.,4
2005-06-10,gwb,"I first want to express my country's deepest condolences for the accident that took place, where a U.S. military vehicle killed a Korean woman.",9
2005-06-10,gwb,And we send our deepest sympathies to the woman's families.,4
2005-06-10,gwb,"And, Mr. President, I just want you to know our heart—our hearts are sad as a result of this incident.",7
2005-06-10,gwb,The President and I had a very long discussion about very important issues.,5
2005-06-10,gwb,And we'll continue this discussion over lunch.,3
2005-06-10,gwb,And the reason why we've had a serious discussion on important issues is because we're strategic partners and allies and friends.,6
2005-06-10,gwb,"I appreciate the President's good advice, and we share the same goals, peace on the Korean Peninsula and peace throughout the world.",6
2005-06-10,gwb,We share the same goals: We want our peoples to grow up in a peaceful society that's a prosperous society.,6
2005-06-10,gwb,"And so, Mr. President, welcome.",3
2005-06-10,gwb,"Thank you for coming, and thank you for your friendship.",4
2005-06-10,gwb,President Roh.,1
2005-06-10,gwb,"I thank you for your warm welcome, and I also thank you for the opportunity for us to engage in extensive discussions on various issues.",9
2005-06-10,gwb,"I also thank you, Mr. President, for your warm message of condolence regarding the unfortunate incident involving U.S. forces Korea.",7
2005-06-10,gwb,"This is my fourth meeting with you, Mr. President, and my second visit to the United States.",6
2005-06-10,gwb,"And every time we meet together, Mr. President, questions abound regarding the possible existence of differences between Korea and the United States surrounding the North Korea nuclear issue.",8
2005-06-10,gwb,"But every time I meet you, Mr. President, in person, I come to the realization that there indeed is no difference between our two sides with regard to the basic principles.",9
2005-06-10,gwb,"In fact, we're in full and perfect agreement on the basic principles.",5
2005-06-10,gwb,"And whatever problem arises in the course of our negotiations and talks, we will be able to work them out under close consultations.",6
2005-06-10,gwb,"There are, admittedly, many people who worry about potential discord or cacophony between the two powers of the alliance.",9
2005-06-10,gwb,"But after going through our discussion today, Mr. President, I realize once again that with regard to all the matters and all the issues of great importance, we were able to deal with them and we were able to bring closure to them smoothly.",9
2005-06-10,gwb,And I am very certain that our alliance remains solid and will continue to remain solid and staunch in the future as well.,8
2005-06-10,gwb,"To be sure, there are one or two minor issues, but I'm also quite certain that we will be able to work them out very smoothly through dialog in the period ahead.",10
2005-06-10,gwb,"How do you feel, Mr. President?",2
2005-06-10,gwb,Wouldn't you agree that the alliance is strong and everything is working—— President Bush.,3
2005-06-10,gwb,"I would say the alliance is very strong, Mr. President.",3
2005-06-10,gwb,And I want to thank you for your frank assessment of the situation on the Peninsula.,8
2005-06-10,gwb,And I'm looking forward to having lunch with you.,4

2005-06-21,gwb,"Mr. Prime Minister, welcome.",1
2005-06-21,gwb,I want to thank you for the constructive visit we just had.,5

2005-06-21,gwb,We discussed our economic relations.,2

2005-06-21,gwb,We talked about security issues and a mutual desire to coordinate in the war on terror.,8
2005-06-21,gwb,We talked about humanitarian issues.,3
2005-06-21,gwb,"As the Prime Minister noted, the United States is supporting the fight against HIV/ AIDS in Vietnam, and he gave me a report on the progress about our mutual desire to help those who suffer with HIV/AIDS.",12
2005-06-21,gwb,We signed a landmark agreement that will make it easier for people to worship freely in Vietnam.,6
2005-06-21,gwb,"And finally, I want to thank the Prime Minister for his Government's willingness to continue to work on the—on finding the remains of those who lost their lives in Vietnam.",9
2005-06-21,gwb,It's very comforting to many families here in America to understand that the Government is providing information to help close a sad chapter in their lives.,7
2005-06-21,gwb,"And finally, the Prime Minister graciously invited me to Vietnam.",2
2005-06-21,gwb,I will be going in 2006.,2
2005-06-21,gwb,I'm looking forward to my trip.,3
2005-06-21,gwb,I'm also looking forward to the APEC Summit that Vietnam will be hosting.,4
2005-06-21,gwb,"Mr. Prime Minister, welcome.",1
2005-06-21,gwb,Prime Minister Khai.,2
2005-06-21,gwb,"Thank you very much Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen.",3
2005-06-21,gwb,"At the invitation of President George W. Bush, it gives me the great pleasure and honor as the first Vietnamese Prime Minister to pay an official visit to the United States.",5
2005-06-21,gwb,"And this event, in itself, shows that Vietnam-U.S. relations have in fact entered a new stage of development.",4
2005-06-21,gwb,My visit to America this time coincides with the 10th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations.,7
2005-06-21,gwb,"During the talks that I had with Mr. President, Mr. President and I were pleased to note the significant developments in the two countries' relations, including the good progress made in addressing the various issues left over by the past as well as the various steps to be taken to expand our relations in the future.",16
2005-06-21,gwb,"Mr. President and I also shared the view that proceeding from the interest of the two countries and given the new developments in the region and the world, the two countries' relationship should be enhanced.",9
2005-06-21,gwb,"And we should aim to build a friendly relationship, constructive partnership, a comprehensive cooperation on a long-term and stable basis as well as on the basis of equality, mutual respect and benefits.",8
2005-06-21,gwb,We believe that America can find in Vietnam a potential cooperation partner.,3
2005-06-21,gwb,"We have a population of 80 million people, which means a huge market for American businesses.",8
2005-06-21,gwb,"And these people are also very hard working, creative, and dynamic.",3
2005-06-21,gwb,And they are now working very hard to achieve the goal of building Vietnam into a strong country with wealthy people and a democratic and advanced society.,11
2005-06-21,gwb,Vietnam is also actively integrating itself into the world economy and wishes to be a friend and reliable partner of all countries in the international community.,8
2005-06-21,gwb,"I also highly appreciate Mr. President's strong support for Vietnam's early WTO accession, and we agreed that Vietnam's accession will be in the benefits of both countries, and we agree to continue with our bilateral negotiations with the aim of concluding those very soon.",11
2005-06-21,gwb,Mr. President and I also agreed that there remain differences between our two countries due to the different conditions that we have—the different histories and cultures.,6
2005-06-21,gwb,But we also agreed that we should work together through constructive dialog based upon mutual respect to reduce those differences in order to improve our bilateral relations.,7
2005-06-21,gwb,"On international issues, Mr. President and I exchanged views on the recent developments in Asia and the Pacific, which we are both concerned about.",10
2005-06-21,gwb,And we also agreed on the needs to improve the effectiveness of APEC for which the 2006 APEC Summit in Vietnam will be an important milestone.,6
2005-06-21,gwb,"I am also delighted that President Bush has accepted my invitation to visit Vietnam and to attend the 2006 APEC Summit, and we also welcome your support for the organization of this summit.",7
2005-06-21,gwb,"I am fully confident that my visit to America this time will help uplift the relationship between our two countries to a new height, and may I finally wish America prosperity and happiness to her people.",7
2005-06-21,gwb,I thank you very much for your time.,3
2005-06-21,gwb,President Bush.,1
2005-06-21,gwb,Thank you very much.,2
2002-09-04,gwb,Thank you all for coming.,2
2002-09-04,gwb,"It's been my honor to welcome the leadership of the United States Congress here, to welcome them back from the August recess.",6
2002-09-04,gwb,"We talked about a variety of issues—talked about the defense appropriations bill and terrorism insurance and an energy bill, spent most of our time talking about a serious threat to the United States, a serious threat to the world, and that's Saddam Hussein.",10
2002-09-04,gwb,One of the things I made very clear to the Members here is that doing nothing about that serious threat is not an option for the United States.,8
2002-09-04,gwb,"I also made it very clear that we look forward to a open dialog with Congress and the American people about the threat and that not only will we consult with the United States Congress— ""we"" being the administration—but that my administration will fully participate in any hearings that the Congress wishes to have on this subject, on the subject about how to make America a more secure country, how to best protect the American families in our country.",16
2002-09-04,gwb,"At the appropriate time, this administration will go to the Congress to seek approval for—necessary to deal with the threat.",6
2002-09-04,gwb,"At the same time, I will work with our friends in the world.",5
2002-09-04,gwb,"I've invited Prime Minister Blair to come to Camp David on Saturday, and he'll—he's coming.",4
2002-09-04,gwb,I've looked forward to talking with him about our mutual concerns about how to make the world more secure and safe.,9
2002-09-04,gwb,"I will see Jean Chretien on Monday, as we—we'll talk about how to make our borders work better, but at the same time, I'll talk to him about this subject.",6
2002-09-04,gwb,"I'll be on the phone to leaders of the—China and Russia and France, and then I'll be giving the speech at the United Nations.",6
2002-09-04,gwb,Saddam Hussein is a serious threat.,2
2002-09-04,gwb,He is a significant problem.,2
2002-09-04,gwb,And it's something that this country must deal with.,4
2002-09-04,gwb,"And today the process starts about how to have an open dialog with the elected officials and, therefore, the American people about our future and how best to deal with it.",6
2005-08-28,gwb,"This morning I spoke with FEMA Under Secretary Mike Brown and emergency management teams, not only at the Federal level but at the State level about the— Hurricane Katrina.",6
2005-08-28,gwb,"I've also spoken to Governor Blanco of Louisiana, Governor Barbour of Mississippi, Governor Bush of Florida, and Governor Riley of Alabama.",6
2005-08-28,gwb,I want to thank all the folks at the Federal level and the State level and the local level who have taken this storm seriously.,8
2005-08-28,gwb,I appreciate the efforts of the Governors to prepare their citizenry for this upcoming storm.,5
2005-08-28,gwb,"Yesterday I signed a disaster declaration for the State of Louisiana, and this morning I signed a disaster declaration for the State of Mississippi.",6
2005-08-28,gwb,These declarations will allow Federal agencies to coordinate all disaster relief efforts with State and local officials.,6
2005-08-28,gwb,We will do everything in our power to help the people in the communities affected by this storm.,8
2005-08-28,gwb,Hurricane Katrina is now designated a category 5 hurricane.,3
2005-08-28,gwb,We cannot stress enough the danger this hurricane poses to gulf coast communities.,4
2005-08-28,gwb,I urge all citizens to put their own safety and the safety of their families first by moving to safe ground.,6
2005-08-28,gwb,Please listen carefully to instructions provided by State and local officials.,7
2005-08-28,gwb,"On another matter, today Iraqi political leaders completed the process for drafting a permanent constitution.",5
2005-08-28,gwb,"Their example is an inspiration to all who share the universal values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.",11
2005-08-28,gwb,"The negotiators and drafters of this document braved the intimidation of terrorists, and they mourn the cowardly assassination of friends and colleagues involved in the process of drafting the constitution.",11
2005-08-28,gwb,Their efforts follow the bravery of the Iraqis who voted by the millions to elect a Transitional Government in January.,7
2005-08-28,gwb,The example of those voters remains a humbling testament to the power of free people to shape and define their own destiny.,6
2005-08-28,gwb,"We honor their courage and sacrifice, and we are determined to see the Iraqis fully secure their democratic gains.",6
2005-08-28,gwb,The Iraqi people have once again demonstrated to the world that they are up to the historic challenges before them.,5
2005-08-28,gwb,"The document they have produced contains far-reaching protections for fundamental human freedoms, including religion, assembly, conscience, and expression.",8
2005-08-28,gwb,"It vests sovereignty in the people, to be expressed by secret ballot and regular elections.",5
2005-08-28,gwb,"It declares that all Iraqis are equal before the law without regard to gender, ethnicity, and religion.",7
2005-08-28,gwb,This is a document of which the Iraqis and the rest of the world can be proud.,7
2005-08-28,gwb,The political process now advances to another important stage for a new and free Iraq.,6
2005-08-28,gwb,"In coming months, Iraqis will discuss and debate the draft constitution.",3
2005-08-28,gwb,"On October the 15th, they will vote in a national referendum to decide whether to ratify the constitution and set the foundation for a permanent Iraqi Government.",6
2005-08-28,gwb,"If the referendum succeeds, Iraqis will elect a new Government, to serve under the new constitution, on December the 15th, and that Government will take office before the end of the year.",6
2005-08-28,gwb,This course is going to be difficult largely because the terrorists have chosen to wage war against a future of freedom.,7
2005-08-28,gwb,They are waging war against peace in Iraq.,5
2005-08-28,gwb,"As democracy in Iraq takes root, the enemies of freedom, the terrorists, will become more desperate, more despicable, and more vicious.",4
2005-08-28,gwb,"Just last week, the terrorists called for the death of anyone, including women and the elderly, who supports the democratic process in Iraq.",8
2005-08-28,gwb,They have deliberately targeted children receiving candy from soldiers.,4
2005-08-28,gwb,They have targeted election workers registering Iraqis to vote.,4
2005-08-28,gwb,They have targeted hospital workers who are caring for the wounded.,5
2005-08-28,gwb,We can expect such atrocities to increase in the coming months because the enemy knows that its greatest defeat lies in the expression of free people and freely enacted laws and at the ballot box.,7
2005-08-28,gwb,We will stand with the Iraqi people.,3
2005-08-28,gwb,It's in our interest to stand with the Iraqi people.,4
2005-08-28,gwb,It's in our interest to lay the foundation of peace.,4
2005-08-28,gwb,"We'll help them confront this barbarism, and we will triumph over the terrorists' dark ideology of hatred and fear.",6
2005-08-28,gwb,There have been disagreements amongst the Iraqis about this particular constitution.,4
2005-08-28,gwb,Of course there's disagreements.,2
2005-08-28,gwb,"We're watching a political process unfold, a process that has encouraged debate and compromise, a constitution that was written in a society in which people recognize that— that there had to be give-and-take.",10
2005-08-28,gwb,"I want our folks to remember, our own Constitution was not unanimously received.",4
2005-08-28,gwb,"Some delegates at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 refused to sign it, and the draft was vigorously debated in every State, and the outcome was not assured until all the votes were counted.",5
2005-08-28,gwb,"We recognize that there's a split amongst the Sunnis, for example, in Iraq.",5
2005-08-28,gwb,"And I suspect that when you get down to it, you'll find a Shi'a who disagrees with the constitution and Shi'as who support the constitution and perhaps some Kurds who are concerned about the constitution.",8
2005-08-28,gwb,"In other words, we're watching a political process unfold.",3
2005-08-28,gwb,"Some Sunnis have expressed reservations about various provisions of the constitution, and that's their right as free individuals living in a free society.",8
2005-08-28,gwb,There are strong beliefs among other Sunnis that this constitution is good for all Iraqis and that it adequately reflects compromises suitable to all groups.,8
2005-08-28,gwb,It's important that all Iraqis now actively engage in the constitutional process by debating the merits of this important document and making an informed decision on October the 15th.,8
2005-08-28,gwb,"On behalf of the American people, I congratulate the people of Iraq on completing the next step in their transition from dictatorship to democracy.",7
2005-08-28,gwb,"And I want to remind the American people, as a democracy unfolds in Iraq, not only will it help make America more secure but it will affect the broader Middle East.",5
2005-08-28,gwb,Democracies don't war with their neighbors.,3
2005-08-28,gwb,Democracies don't become safe haven for terrorists who want to destroy innocent life.,7
2005-08-28,gwb,"We have hard work ahead of us, but we're on the—we're making good progress toward making sure this world of ours is more peaceful for generations to come.",12
2005-08-28,gwb,Thank you very much.,2

2005-03-31,gwb,We face a new and different kind of enemy.,3
2005-03-31,gwb,The threats today are unprecedented.,2
2005-03-31,gwb,The lives of our citizens are at stake.,4
2005-03-31,gwb,"To protect them, we need the best intelligence possible, and we must stay ahead of constantly changing intelligence challenges.",6
2005-03-31,gwb,"So last year I issued an Executive order creating an independent Commission to look at America's intelligence capabilities, especially our intelligence about weapons of mass destruction.",11
2005-03-31,gwb,"I asked two fine Americans to chair this Commission, Judge Laurence Silberman and former Senator Chuck Robb.",6
2005-03-31,gwb,They have done an excellent job.,2
2005-03-31,gwb,I appreciate your service to our country.,4

2005-03-31,gwb,I want to thank them for their hard work.,4
2005-03-31,gwb,They spent a lot of time on this project.,3
2005-03-31,gwb,"I asked these distinguished individuals to give me an unvarnished look at our intelligence community, and they have delivered.",5
2005-03-31,gwb,"This morning the Commission presented me with their recommendations, which are thoughtful and extremely significant.",6
2005-03-31,gwb,The central conclusion is one that I share: America's intelligence community needs fundamental change to enable us to successfully confront the threats of the 21st century.,6
2005-03-31,gwb,My administration has taken steps consistent with the Commission's recommendations.,6
2005-03-31,gwb,"In February, I named John Negroponte the first Director of National Intelligence, a post that was created to help ensure that our intelligence community works as a single, unified enterprise.",10
2005-03-31,gwb,"It's important for Congress to move quickly on John's confirmation, because he'll have a key role in the continued reform and restructuring of intelligence capabilities.",7
2005-03-31,gwb,"Today I've directed Homeland Secretary Adviser Fran Townsend to oversee the interagency process, to review the Commission's findings, and to ensure that concrete action is taken.",5
2005-03-31,gwb,"The Commission report delivers a sharp critique of the way intelligence has been collected and analyzed against some of the most difficult intelligence targets, especially Iraq.",11
2005-03-31,gwb,"To win the war on terror, we will correct what needs to be fixed and build on what the Commission calls solid intelligence successes.",7
2005-03-31,gwb,These include the uncovering of Libya's nuclear and missile programs.,5
2005-03-31,gwb,"In Pakistan, our intelligence helped expose and shut down the world's most dangerous nuclear proliferation network.",4
2005-03-31,gwb,"Where we have had success, the Commission reports we have seen innovative collection techniques and a fusion of interagency intelligence capabilities.",7
2005-03-31,gwb,We must work to replicate these successes in other areas.,4
2005-03-31,gwb,"The men and women of our intelligence community work hard, and the sacrifices they have made have helped protect America.",4
2005-03-31,gwb,And our Nation is grateful for their hard work.,4
2005-03-31,gwb,The work they're doing is critical.,3
2005-03-31,gwb,We need to prevent terrorists from getting their hands on the weapons of mass murder they would like to use against our citizens.,10
2005-03-31,gwb,The work of our intelligence community is extremely difficult work.,4
2005-03-31,gwb,"Every day, dangerous regimes are working to prevent us from uncovering their programs and their possible relationships with terrorists.",7
2005-03-31,gwb,"And the work our intelligence men and women do is, by nature, secret, which is why the American people never hear about many of their successes.",9
2005-03-31,gwb,"I'm proud of the efforts of our intelligence workers, and I'm proud of their commitment to the security of our country.",9
2005-03-31,gwb,And the American people should be proud too.,2
2005-03-31,gwb,And that's why this report is important.,3
2005-03-31,gwb,"It will enable these fine men and women to do their jobs in better fashion, to be able to more likely accomplish their mission, which is to protect the American people.",8
2005-03-31,gwb,And that's why I'm grateful to the Commission for this hard work.,5
2005-03-31,gwb,The President and his national security team must have intelligence that is timely and intelligence that is accurate.,4
2005-03-31,gwb,"In their report today, the Commission points out that America needs to know much more about the weapons programs and intentions of our most dangerous adversaries.",10
2005-03-31,gwb,They have given us useful and important guidance that will help us transform our intelligence capabilities for the needs of a dangerous new century.,8
2005-03-31,gwb,"In other words, we need to adjust.",3
2005-03-31,gwb,We need to understand the threats and adjust our capabilities to meet those threats.,5
2005-03-31,gwb,We will work to give our intelligence professionals the tools they need.,4
2005-03-31,gwb,"Our collection and analysis of intelligence will never be perfect, but in an age where our margin for error is getting smaller, in an age in which we are at war, the consequences of underestimating a threat could be tens of thousands of innocent lives.",7
2005-03-31,gwb,And my administration will continue to make intelligence reforms that will allow us to identify threats before they fully emerge so we can take effective action to protect the American people.,10
2005-03-31,gwb,I'm grateful for your hard work.,4
2005-03-31,gwb,And now the Chairman of the Commission and the Cochairman of the Commission have agreed to answer your questions.,5
2007-05-01,gwb,Good evening.,1
2007-05-01,gwb,"Twelve weeks ago, I asked the Congress to pass an emergency war spending bill that would provide our brave men and women in uniform with the funds and flexibility they need.",7
2007-05-01,gwb,"Instead, Members of the House and the Senate passed a bill that substitutes the opinions of politicians for the judgment of our military commanders.",7
2007-05-01,gwb,"So a few minutes ago, I vetoed the bill.",4
2007-05-01,gwb,Tonight I will explain the reasons for this veto and my desire to work with Congress to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.,7
2007-05-01,gwb,We can begin tomorrow with a bipartisan meeting with the congressional leaders here at the White House.,8
2007-05-01,gwb,Here is why the bill Congress passed is unacceptable.,4
2007-05-01,gwb,"First, the bill would mandate a rigid and artificial deadline for American troops to begin withdrawing from Iraq.",5
2007-05-01,gwb,"That withdrawal could start as early as July 1st, and it would have to start no later than October 1st, regardless of the situation on the ground.",8
2007-05-01,gwb,It makes no sense to tell the enemy when you plan to start withdrawing.,4
2007-05-01,gwb,All the terrorists would have to do is mark their calendars and gather their strength and begin plotting how to overthrow the Government and take control of the country of Iraq.,12
2007-05-01,gwb,"I believe setting a deadline for withdrawal would demoralize the Iraqi people, would encourage killers across the broader Middle East, and send a signal that America will not keep its commitments.",6
2007-05-01,gwb,"Setting a deadline for withdrawal is setting a date for failure, and that would be irresponsible.",4
2007-05-01,gwb,"Second, the bill would impose impossible conditions on our commanders in combat.",4
2007-05-01,gwb,"After forcing most of our troops to withdraw, the bill would dictate the terms on which the remaining commanders and troops could engage the enemy.",6
2007-05-01,gwb,"That means American commanders in the middle of a combat zone would have to take fighting directions from politicians 6,000 miles away in Washington, DC.",7
2007-05-01,gwb,"This is a prescription for chaos and confusion, and we must not impose it on our troops.",4
2007-05-01,gwb,"Third, the bill is loaded with billions of dollars in nonemergency spending that has nothing to do with fighting the war on terror.",12
2007-05-01,gwb,Congress should debate these spending measures on their own merits and not as a part of an emergency funding bill for our troops.,7
2007-05-01,gwb,The Democratic leaders know that many in Congress disagree with their approach and that there are not enough votes to override the veto.,6
2007-05-01,gwb,I recognize that many Democrats saw this bill as an opportunity to make a political statement about their opposition to the war.,10
2007-05-01,gwb,They've sent their message.,2
2007-05-01,gwb,And now it is time to put politics behind us and support our troops with the funds they need.,7
2007-05-01,gwb,"Our troops are carrying out a new strategy with a new commander, General David Petraeus.",4
2007-05-01,gwb,"The goal of this new strategy is to help the Iraqis secure their capital so they can make progress toward reconciliation and build a free nation that respects the rights of its people, upholds the rule of law, and fights extremists and radicals and killers alongside the United States in this war on terror.",9
2007-05-01,gwb,"In January, General Petraeus was confirmed by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate.",6
2007-05-01,gwb,"In February, we began sending the first of the reinforcements he requested.",6
2007-05-01,gwb,Not all of these reinforcements have arrived in Baghdad.,4
2007-05-01,gwb,"And as General Petraeus has said, it will be the end of summer before we can assess the impact of this operation.",5
2007-05-01,gwb,Congress ought to give General Petraeus's plan a chance to work.,4
2007-05-01,gwb,"In the months since our military has been implementing this plan, we've begun to see some important results.",3
2007-05-01,gwb,"For example, Iraqi and coalition forces have closed down an Al Qaida car bomb network; they've captured a Shi'a militia leader implicated in the kidnaping and killing of American soldiers; they've broken up a death squad that had terrorized hundreds of residents in a Baghdad neighborhood.",8
2007-05-01,gwb,"Last week, General Petraeus was in Washington to brief me, and he briefed Members of Congress on how the operation is unfolding.",5
2007-05-01,gwb,He noted that one of the most important indicators of progress is the level of sectarian violence in Baghdad.,6
2007-05-01,gwb,"And he reported that since January, the number of sectarian murders has dropped substantially.",5
2007-05-01,gwb,"Even as sectarian attacks have declined, we continue to see spectacular suicide attacks that have caused great suffering.",5
2007-05-01,gwb,"These attacks are largely the work of Al Qaida, the enemy that everyone agrees we should be fighting.",7
2007-05-01,gwb,The objective of these Al Qaida attacks is to subvert our efforts by reigniting the sectarian violence in Baghdad and breaking support for the war here at home.,9
2007-05-01,gwb,"In Washington last week, General Petraeus explained it this way: ""Iraq is, in fact, the central front of all Al Qaida's global campaign.""",5
2007-05-01,gwb,Al Qaida's role makes it—the conflict in Iraq far more complex than a simple fight between Iraqis.,7
2007-05-01,gwb,"It's true that not everyone taking innocent life in Iraq wants to attack America here at home, but many do.",5
2007-05-01,gwb,"Many also belong to the same terrorist network that attacked us on September the 11th, 2001, and wants to attack us here at home again.",7
2007-05-01,gwb,We saw the death and destruction Al Qaida inflicted on our people when they were permitted a safe haven in Afghanistan.,5
2007-05-01,gwb,"For the security of the American people, we must not allow Al Qaida to establish a new safe haven in Iraq.",5
2007-05-01,gwb,We need to give our troops all the equipment and the training and protection they need to prevail.,5
2007-05-01,gwb,That means that Congress needs to pass an emergency war spending bill quickly.,5
2007-05-01,gwb,I've invited leaders of both parties to come to the White House tomorrow and to discuss how we can get these vital funds to our troops.,6
2007-05-01,gwb,"I am confident that with good will on both sides, we can agree on a bill that gets our troops the money and flexibility they need as soon as possible.",10
2007-05-01,gwb,The need to act is urgent.,3
2007-05-01,gwb,"Without a war funding bill, the military has to take money from some other account or training program so the troops in combat have what they need.",5
2007-05-01,gwb,"Without a war funding bill, the Armed Forces will have to consider cutting back on buying new equipment or repairing existing equipment.",7
2007-05-01,gwb,"Without a war funding bill, we add to the uncertainty felt by our military families.",6
2007-05-01,gwb,"Our troops and their families deserve better, and their elected leaders can do better.",3
2007-05-01,gwb,"Here in Washington, we have our differences on the way forward in Iraq, and we will debate them openly.",5
2007-05-01,gwb,"Yet whatever our differences, surely we can agree that our troops are worthy of this funding and that we have a responsibility to get it to them without further delay.",7
2007-05-01,gwb,Thank you for listening.,2
2007-05-01,gwb,May God bless our troops.,2
2001-01-29,gwb,Good morning.,1
2001-01-29,gwb,Thank you all for coming.,2
2001-01-29,gwb,I take great joy in making this announcement.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,It's going to be one of the most important initiatives that my administration not only discusses but implements.,7
2001-01-29,gwb,"First, it's good to have so many groups represented here: religious and nonreligious; Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and Muslim; foundations and other nonprofits.",8
2001-01-29,gwb,I want to thank you all for coming.,3
2001-01-29,gwb,"This is a collection of some of the finest America has got to offer, people who lead with their hearts and, in turn, have changed the communities in which they live for the better.",7
2001-01-29,gwb,This meeting is a picture of the strength and diversity and compassion of our country.,6
2001-01-29,gwb,"This is a diverse group, but we share things in common.",3
2001-01-29,gwb,They provide more than practical help to people in need; they touch and change hearts.,5
2001-01-29,gwb,"And for this, America is deeply appreciative.",2
2001-01-29,gwb,"Everyone in this room knows firsthand that there are still deep needs and real suffering in the shadow of America's affluence, problems like addiction and abandonment and gang violence, domestic violence, mental illness, and homelessness.",8
2001-01-29,gwb,We are called by conscience to respond.,2
2001-01-29,gwb,"As I said in my Inaugural Address, compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.",4
2001-01-29,gwb,It is more than the calling of politicians; it is the calling of citizens.,6
2001-01-29,gwb,It is citizens who turn mean streets into good neighborhoods.,5
2001-01-29,gwb,It is citizens who turn cold cities into real communities.,5
2001-01-29,gwb,It is one of the great goals of my administration to invigorate the spirit of involvement and citizenship.,6
2001-01-29,gwb,We will encourage faith-based and community programs without changing their mission.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,We will help all in their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment to pluralism.,5
2001-01-29,gwb,I approach this goal with some basic principles.,3
2001-01-29,gwb,"Government has important responsibilities for public health or public order and civil rights, and Government will never be replaced by charities and community groups.",6
2001-01-29,gwb,"Yet when we see social needs in America, my administration will look first to faith-based programs and community groups, which have proven their power to save and change lives.",7
2001-01-29,gwb,"We will not fund the religious activities of any group, but when people of faith provide social services, we will not discriminate against them.",5
2001-01-29,gwb,"As long as there are secular alternatives, faith-based charities should be able to compete for funding on an equal basis and in a manner that does not cause them to sacrifice their mission.",7
2001-01-29,gwb,"And we will make sure that help goes to large organizations and to small ones, as well.",6
2001-01-29,gwb,We value large organizations with generations of experience.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,"We also value neighborhood healers, who have only the scars and testimony of their own experience.",6
2001-01-29,gwb,Tomorrow I will begin turning these principles into a legislative agenda.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,I will send to Congress a series of ideas and proposals.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,Today I want to raise the priority and profile of these issues within my own administration.,5
2001-01-29,gwb,I want to ensure that faithbased and community groups will always have a place at the table in our deliberations.,6
2001-01-29,gwb,"In a few moments, I will sign two Executive orders.",3
2001-01-29,gwb,The first Executive order will create a new office called the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.,7
2001-01-29,gwb,The head of this office will report directly to me and be charged with important responsibilities.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,He will oversee our initiatives on this issue.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,"He will make sure our Government, where it works with private groups, is fair and supportive.",7
2001-01-29,gwb,And he will highlight groups as national models so others can learn from them.,3
2001-01-29,gwb,The second Executive order will clear away the bureaucratic barriers in several important agencies that make private groups hesitate to work with Government.,8
2001-01-29,gwb,"It will establish centers in five agencies— Justice, HUD, HHS, Labor, and Education—to ensure greater cooperation between the Government and the independent sector.",7
2001-01-29,gwb,These centers will report back on regulatory barriers to working with nonprofit groups and make recommendations on how those barriers can be removed.,10
2001-01-29,gwb,"I have put this broad effort into the hands of two exceptional people—first, Steve Goldsmith, known as one of the most innovative mayors in America, who pioneered ways to promote community efforts.",11
2001-01-29,gwb,He will continue to advise me on these issues.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,And I have asked Steve to serve on the board of the Corporation for National Service.,8
2001-01-29,gwb,This organization has done some good work in mobilizing volunteers of all ages.,6
2001-01-29,gwb,I've asked Steve to report to me on how we can make the Corporation do better and to get help where it's most needed.,7
2001-01-29,gwb,"And secondly, Professor John DiIulio will head the new office I am announcing today.",3
2001-01-29,gwb,He is one of the most influential social entrepreneurs in America.,5
2001-01-29,gwb,I can't tell you how honored I am for him to leave his post in academia to join us.,5
2001-01-29,gwb,He is the author of a respected textbook on American Government.,6
2001-01-29,gwb,He has a servant's heart on the issues that we will confront.,5
2001-01-29,gwb,He's worked with disadvantaged children.,3
2001-01-29,gwb,He has been a major force in mobilizing the city of Philadelphia to support faith-based and community groups.,7
2001-01-29,gwb,It's a fantastic team.,2
2001-01-29,gwb,I'm honored to have them on my team.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,"I look forward to hearing from them, as well as I look forward to working with the people in this room and the social entrepreneurs all across America who've heard the universal call to love a neighbor like they'd like to be loved themselves, to exist and work hard, not out of the love of money but out of the love of their fellow human beings.",12
2001-01-29,gwb,"I'm absolutely convinced the great fabric of the Nation exists in neighborhoods, amongst unsung heroes who do heroic acts on a daily and hourly basis.",9
2001-01-29,gwb,It's the fabric of the country that makes America unique.,4
2001-01-29,gwb,It is the power of promise that makes the future so promising—is the power of the missions that stand behind me.,7
2001-01-29,gwb,"This is an effort that will be an effort from now, the second week of my administration, to the last week of my administration, because I am confident that this initiative, when fully implemented, will help us realize the dream that America—its hopes, its promise, its greatness will extend its reach throughout every single neighborhood all across the land.",10
2001-01-29,gwb,And now it is my honor to sign the two Executive orders.,3
2001-06-07,gwb,Thank you.,1
2001-06-07,gwb,Sit down.,1
2001-06-07,gwb,Behave yourself.,1
2001-06-07,gwb,You're at the White House.,3
2001-06-07,gwb,"Laura, thank you very much for being here on this historic moment.",5
2001-06-07,gwb,"Mr. Vice President, Secretary O'Neill, Director Daniels, Secretary Evans and Chao are here, as well.",5
2001-06-07,gwb,"Secretary Abraham, Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, Members of the United States Senate, Members of the House of Representatives, fellow Americans, welcome.",7
2001-06-07,gwb,"Some months ago, in my speech to the joint session of Congress, I had the honor of introducing Steven Ramos to the Nation.",6
2001-06-07,gwb,Steven is the network administrator for a school district.,3
2001-06-07,gwb,"His wife, Josefina, teaches at a charter school.",3
2001-06-07,gwb,"They have a little girl named Lianna, and they're trying to save for Lianna's college education.",6
2001-06-07,gwb,High taxes made saving difficult.,2
2001-06-07,gwb,"Last year they paid nearly $8,000 in Federal income taxes.",3
2001-06-07,gwb,"Well, today we're beginning to make life for the Ramos' a lot easier.",5
2001-06-07,gwb,Today we start to return some of the Ramos' money and not only their money but the money of everybody who paid taxes in the United States of America.,9
2001-06-07,gwb,"Across the board tax relief does not happen often in Washington, DC.",3
2001-06-07,gwb,"In fact, since World War II, it has happened only twice: President Kennedy's tax cut in the sixties and President Reagan's tax cuts in the 1980s.",6
2001-06-07,gwb,"And now it's happening for the third time, and it's about time.",3
2001-06-07,gwb,A year ago tax relief was said to be a political impossibility.,3
2001-06-07,gwb,Six months ago it was supposed to be a political liability.,3
2001-06-07,gwb,Today it becomes reality.,1
2001-06-07,gwb,"It becomes reality because of the bipartisan leadership of the Members of the United States Congress, Members like Bill Thomas of California, Ralph Hall of Texas, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Max Baucus of Montana, Zell Miller of Georgia, John Breaux of Louisiana, Trent Lott of Mississippi and the entire leadership team in the Senate, and Denny Hastert of Illinois and the leadership team in the House of Representatives—some Democrats, many Republicans—who worked tirelessly and effectively to produce this important result.",13
2001-06-07,gwb,"I also want to pay tribute to the members of my administration who worked with Congress to bring about this day: Vice President Cheney, Secretary O'Neill, Director Daniels, and the team inside the White House of Andy Card and Larry Lindsey, Nick Calio, and their staffs.",7
2001-06-07,gwb,With us today are 15 of the many families I met as I toured our country making the case for tax relief—hard-working Americans.,10
2001-06-07,gwb,"I was able to talk about their stories and their struggles and their hopes, which made the case for tax relief much stronger than my words could possible convey.",10
2001-06-07,gwb,And I want to thank you all for coming.,3
2001-06-07,gwb,"And here at the White House today are representatives of millions of Americans, including labor union members, small-business owners, and family farmers.",8
2001-06-07,gwb,Your persistence and determination helped bring us to this day.,4
2001-06-07,gwb,"The American people should be proud of your efforts on their behalf, and I personally thank you all for coming.",6
2001-06-07,gwb,Tax relief is a great achievement for the American people.,4
2001-06-07,gwb,"Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in Washington, and it was produced in record time.",6
2001-06-07,gwb,Tax relief is an achievement for families struggling to enter the middle class.,7
2001-06-07,gwb,"For hard-working lower income families, we have cut the bottom rate of Federal income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent.",4
2001-06-07,gwb,"We doubled the per-child tax credit to $1,000 and made it refundable.",3
2001-06-07,gwb,"Tax relief is compassionate, and it is now on the way.",4
2001-06-07,gwb,Tax relief is an achievement for middle class families squeezed by high energy prices and credit card debt.,9
2001-06-07,gwb,Most families can look forward to a $600 tax rebate before they have to pay the September backto-school bills.,5
2001-06-07,gwb,"And in the years ahead, taxpayers can look forward to steadily declining income tax rates.",4
2001-06-07,gwb,"Tax relief is an achievement for families that want the Government tax policy to be fair and not penalize them for making good choices, good choices such as marriage and raising a family.",15
2001-06-07,gwb,So we cut the marriage penalty.,2
2001-06-07,gwb,Tax relief makes the code more fair for small businesses and farmers and individuals by eliminating the death tax.,5
2001-06-07,gwb,"Over the long haul, tax relief will encourage work and innovation.",3
2001-06-07,gwb,It will allow American workers to save more on their pension plan or individual retirement accounts.,5
2001-06-07,gwb,Tax relief expands individual freedom.,2
2001-06-07,gwb,"The money we return, or don't take in the first place, can be saved for a child's education, spent on family needs, invested in a home or in a business or a mutual fund or used to reduce personal debt.",9
2001-06-07,gwb,The message we send today: It's up to the American people; it's the American people's choice.,5
2001-06-07,gwb,"We recognize, loud and clear, the surplus is not the Government's money.",4
2001-06-07,gwb,"The surplus is the people's money, and we ought to trust them with their own money.",5
2001-06-07,gwb,This tax relief plan is principled.,3
2001-06-07,gwb,We cut taxes for every income-tax payer.,4
2001-06-07,gwb,We target nobody in; we target nobody out.,2
2001-06-07,gwb,And tax relief is now on the way.,3
2001-06-07,gwb,Today is a great day for America.,3
2001-06-07,gwb,"It is the first major achievement of a new era, an era of steady cooperation.",5
2001-06-07,gwb,And more achievements are ahead.,2
2001-06-07,gwb,I thank the Members of Congress in both parties who made today possible.,5

2008-02-13,gwb,Thanks for coming.,2
2008-02-13,gwb,Thanks for the warm welcome.,3
2008-02-13,gwb,I'm pleased to be joined by leaders of both parties to enact an economic growth package on behalf of the American people.,8
2008-02-13,gwb,"You know, a lot of folks in America probably were saying that it's impossible for those of us in Washington to find common ground, to reach compromise on important issues.",7
2008-02-13,gwb,I didn't feel that way; I know the leaders didn't feel that way.,3
2008-02-13,gwb,"And as a result, we have come together on a single mission, and that is to put the people's interests first.",5
2008-02-13,gwb,"And I really do welcome the Members of Congress, and I thank you for your hard work.",4
2008-02-13,gwb,"Madame Speaker, I thank you for your leadership.",3

2008-02-13,gwb,You're welcome here in the people's house any time.,5
2008-02-13,gwb,I'm very grateful that members of my Cabinet have joined us.,6
2008-02-13,gwb,"Secretary Paulson was the leader in the negotiations on this, and I thank you very much for your hard work, Mr. Secretary.",5
2008-02-13,gwb,You're earning your pay.,2
2008-02-13,gwb,Appreciate other members of my Cabinet who have joined us as well.,4
2008-02-13,gwb,"You know, I know a lot of Americans are concerned about our economic future.",5
2008-02-13,gwb,"Our overall economy has grown for 6 straight years, but that growth has clearly slowed.",3
2008-02-13,gwb,"And so in January, I—we had an important phone call with the leaders of the Congress to talk about whether or not we could come together to provide a booster shot for our economy: a package that is robust, temporary, and puts money back into the hands of American workers and businesses.",9
2008-02-13,gwb,"Congress passed a really good piece of legislation, and they did so in a very expeditious manner.",5
2008-02-13,gwb,"The bill I'm signing today is large enough to have an impact, amounting to more than $152 billion this year, or about 1 percent of GDP.",4
2008-02-13,gwb,The bill provides temporary tax incentives for businesses to make investments in their companies so that we create new jobs this year.,5
2008-02-13,gwb,The bill provides individual tax relief in the form of tax rebates.,5
2008-02-13,gwb,"These rebates will amount to as much as $600 for individuals and $1,200 for married couples, with additional rebates for families with children.",6
2008-02-13,gwb,"The Members resisted the temptation to load up this bill with unrelated programs or unnecessary spending, and I appreciate that.",6
2008-02-13,gwb,I thank the Members for acting quickly.,3
2008-02-13,gwb,I thank them for acting to provide immediate tax relief to the American people.,6
2008-02-13,gwb,There are other ways we can work together to help our economy through this rough patch.,6
2008-02-13,gwb,I know many Americans are worried about meeting their mortgages.,6
2008-02-13,gwb,My administration is working to address this problem.,3
2008-02-13,gwb,"Last fall, for example, we brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.",4
2008-02-13,gwb,Yesterday Secretaries Paulson and Jackson joined HOPE NOW in announcing what is called Project Lifeline.,5
2008-02-13,gwb,It's a targeted outreach effort to help more at-risk homeowners.,5
2008-02-13,gwb,"Congress can also help by passing legislation to reform the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and to allow State housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages.",8
2008-02-13,gwb,I hope that Congress can act on these matters quickly.,4
2008-02-13,gwb,Helping our economy requires us to take action.,3
2008-02-13,gwb,It is equally important that we not overreact.,2
2008-02-13,gwb,"Our economic success is not the result of the wisdom of politicians in Washington, DC, but of the collective wisdom of the American people.",8
2008-02-13,gwb,"Shopkeepers, farmers, laborers, entrepreneurs in the private sector have given us the most—the strongest and most resilient economic system in the world.",5
2008-02-13,gwb,"Over the past 7 years, this system has absorbed shocks: recession, corporate scandals, terrorist attacks, global war.",6
2008-02-13,gwb,Yet the genius of our system is that it can absorb such shocks and emerge even stronger.,4
2008-02-13,gwb,"In a dynamic market economy, there will always be times when we experience uncertainties and fluctuations.",4
2008-02-13,gwb,"But so long as we pursue progrowth policies that put faith in the American people, our economy will prosper, and it will continue to be the marvel of the world.",7
2008-02-13,gwb,Now I'm honored to sign the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008.,4
2007-12-19,gwb,Thank you all.,2
2007-12-19,gwb,Please be seated.,1
2007-12-19,gwb,"Mr. Secretary, thank you for that introduction.",3
2007-12-19,gwb,We're all pleased to be here at the Department of Energy.,7
2007-12-19,gwb,I particularly want to thank the employees here for their daily efforts to help our country meet its energy needs.,7
2007-12-19,gwb,Thanks for your hard work.,3
2007-12-19,gwb,"Sam, thank you for your leadership.",3
2007-12-19,gwb,"As Sam mentioned, I firmly believe this country needs to have a comprehensive energy strategy, and I appreciate the Members of Congress for understanding that as well.",5
2007-12-19,gwb,"Two years ago, I was pleased to stand with Members—many of whom are here— to sign a bill that was the first major energy security legislation in more than a decade.",8
2007-12-19,gwb,"At the time, I recognized that we needed to go even further.",4
2007-12-19,gwb,"And so in my State of the Union, I proposed an aggressive plan to reduce oil consumption of gasoline by 20 percent over 10 years.",5
2007-12-19,gwb,Today we make a major step with the Energy Independence and Security Act.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,"We make a major step toward reducing our dependence on oil, confronting global climate change, expanding the production of renewable fuels, and giving future generations of our country a nation that is stronger, cleaner, and more secure.",12
2007-12-19,gwb,I do welcome members of the Cabinet who've joined us.,4
2007-12-19,gwb,I particularly want to thank the Speaker and the leader.,4
2007-12-19,gwb,I appreciate your leadership on this important issue.,3
2007-12-19,gwb,"Speaker Pelosi is here with Congressman Steny Hoyer, House majority leader.",4
2007-12-19,gwb,"Welcome, Mr. Leader.",2
2007-12-19,gwb,"Leader Reid has brought Members of the Senate with him: Senator Inouye, Senator Bingaman, Senator Stevens—I think that's Senator Domenici there in disguise with a—.",7
2007-12-19,gwb,"Looking pretty handsome, isn't he?",3
2007-12-19,gwb,"I appreciate Congressman Dingell and Congressman Markey, Congressman Gordon.",4
2007-12-19,gwb,These are all leaders on their respective committees that helped bring this bill to my desk.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,I also want to welcome all the other Members of Congress who've joined us.,4
2007-12-19,gwb,"One of the most serious long-term challenges facing our country is dependence on oil, especially oil from foreign lands.",7
2007-12-19,gwb,It's a serious challenge.,2
2007-12-19,gwb,"And Members of Congress up here understand the challenge, and so do I.",3
2007-12-19,gwb,"Because this dependence harms us economically through high and volatile prices at the gas pump, dependence creates pollution and contributes to greenhouse gas admissions.",6
2007-12-19,gwb,It threatens our national security by making us vulnerable to hostile regimes in unstable regions of the world.,8
2007-12-19,gwb,It makes us vulnerable to terrorists who might attack oil infrastructure.,6
2007-12-19,gwb,The legislation I am signing today will address our vulnerabilities and our dependence in two important ways.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,"First, it will increase the supply of alternative fuel sources.",4
2007-12-19,gwb,I proposed an alternative fuel standard earlier this year.,2
2007-12-19,gwb,This standard would require fuel producers to include a certain amount of alternative fuels in their products.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,This standard would create new markets for foreign products used to produce these fuels.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,"This standard would increase our energy security by making us less vulnerable to instability, to the instability of oil prices on the world market.",7
2007-12-19,gwb,The bill I sign today takes a significant step because it will require fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel in 2022.,6
2007-12-19,gwb,This is nearly a fivefold increase over current levels.,4
2007-12-19,gwb,It will help us diversify our energy supplies and reduce our dependence on oil.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,"It's an important part of this legislation, and I thank the Members of Congress for your wisdom.",4
2007-12-19,gwb,"Second, the legislation also—will also reduce our demand for oil by increasing fuel economy standards.",4
2007-12-19,gwb,"Last January, I called for the first statutory increase in fuel economy standards for automobiles since they were enacted in 1975.",6
2007-12-19,gwb,The bill I'm about to sign delivers on that request.,7
2007-12-19,gwb,"It specifies a national standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, which will increase fuel economy standards by 40 percent and save billions of gallons of fuel.",9
2007-12-19,gwb,This bill also includes an important reform that I believe is essential to making sure that we realize this strategy.,10
2007-12-19,gwb,"It allows the Department of Transportation to issue what are known as attribute-based standards, which will assure that increased fuel efficiency does not come at the expense of automobile safety.",11
2007-12-19,gwb,"This is an important part of this bill, and again, I thank the Members for taking the lead.",5
2007-12-19,gwb,The bill also includes revisions to improve energy efficiency in lighting and appliances.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,It adopts elements of the Executive order I signed requiring Federal Agencies to lead by example in efficiency and renewable energy use.,12
2007-12-19,gwb,"Taken together, all these measures will help us improve our environment.",3
2007-12-19,gwb,It is estimated that these initiatives could reduce projected CO2 emissions by billions of metric tons.,6
2007-12-19,gwb,"The U.N. climate change meeting in Bali last week, our Nation promised to pursue new, quantifiable actions to reduce carbon emissions.",5
2007-12-19,gwb,Today we're doing just that.,2
2007-12-19,gwb,The legislation I'm signing today will lead to some of the largest CO2 emission cuts in our Nation's history.,8
2007-12-19,gwb,The legislation I'm about to sign should say to the American people that we can find common ground on critical issues.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,And there's more we can accomplish together.,2
2007-12-19,gwb,New technologies will bring about a new era of energy.,3
2007-12-19,gwb,So I appreciate the fact that Congress—in the omnibus spending bill that I'm going to sign later on—recognizes that new technologies will help usher in a better quality of life for our citizens.,7
2007-12-19,gwb,And so we're going to spend money on new research for alternative feedstocks for ethanol.,7
2007-12-19,gwb,"I mean, we understand the hog growers are getting nervous because the price of corn is up.",5
2007-12-19,gwb,But we also believe strongly that research will enable us to use wood chips and switchgrass and biomass to be able to develop the ethanol necessary to help us realize the vision outlined in this bill.,10
2007-12-19,gwb,I appreciate very much the fact that we're going to fund additional research on new battery technologies to power plug-in hybrids.,7
2007-12-19,gwb,We're spending money on innovative ways to capture solar power.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,We're making—providing incentives for nuclear energy.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,"If we're serious about making sure we grow our economy and deal with greenhouse gases, we have got to expand nuclear power.",10
2007-12-19,gwb,It is going to take time to transition to this new era.,5
2007-12-19,gwb,And we're still going to need hydrocarbons.,2
2007-12-19,gwb,"And I hope the Congress will continue to open access to domestic energy sources: certain parts of the Outer Continental Shelf, in ANWR.",6
2007-12-19,gwb,"And to protect us against disruptions in our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.",6
2007-12-19,gwb,With these steps—particularly in the bill I'm about to sign—we're going to help American consumers a lot.,6
2007-12-19,gwb,"We'll help them by diversifying our supplies, which will help lower energy prices.",6
2007-12-19,gwb,We'll strengthen our security by helping to break our dependence on foreign oil.,7
2007-12-19,gwb,We'll do our duty to future generations by addressing climate change.,4
2007-12-19,gwb,And so I thank the Members of Congress.,3
2007-12-19,gwb,"I appreciate the fact that we've worked together, that we can show what's possible in addressing the big issues facing our Nation.",7
2007-12-19,gwb,"This is a good bill, and I'm pleased to sign it.",4
2003-05-28,gwb,Thank you all very much.,2
2003-05-28,gwb,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House.",4
2003-05-28,gwb,Today we are taking essential action to strengthen the American economy.,4
2003-05-28,gwb,"With my signature, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 will deliver substantial tax relief to 136 million American taxpayers.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,We are helping workers who need more take-home pay.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,We're helping seniors who rely on dividends.,4
2003-05-28,gwb,We're helping small-business owners looking to grow and to create more new jobs.,4
2003-05-28,gwb,We're helping families with children who will receive immediate relief.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,"By ensuring that Americans have more to spend, to save, and to invest, this legislation is adding fuel to an economic recovery.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,We have taken aggressive action to strengthen the foundation of our economy so that every American who wants to work will be able to find a job.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,I want to thank the members of my team who have worked so hard to get this bill to this desk.,7
2003-05-28,gwb,I particularly want to thank Secretary John Snow and Secretary Don Evans for their tireless efforts to convince members of both political parties what we're doing today is the right thing to do on behalf of all Americans.,8

2003-05-28,gwb,I particularly want to thank the Members of the United States Congress who worked closely with the administration to do what was right for the American people.,9
2003-05-28,gwb,"Speaker Hastert—Speaker Denny Hastert isn't with us, but he put forth a monumental effort to get this bill done, as did Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,"I'm particularly pleased that not only did the majority leader join me up here, but so does the chairman of the Ways and Means, Chairman Bill Thomas.",5
2003-05-28,gwb,"He got the job done along with Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Finance chairman in the Senate.",9
2003-05-28,gwb,"These two good men worked out differences in a quick period of time and got the bill to the respective bodies quickly, where both Republicans and Democrats supported this major piece of legislation.",5
2003-05-28,gwb,"I want to thank the Members from the United States House of Representatives who are with us today as well as Senator Thad Cochran, representing other Members of the Senate.",7
2003-05-28,gwb,We're honored you all are here.,4
2003-05-28,gwb,I want to thank all the Members who voted for this bill.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,We had great support in the House.,3
2003-05-28,gwb,"Senators Miller and Nelson also supported the Republican majority in the Senate, so that we can say loud and clear to the American people, ""You got more of your own money to spend so that this economy can get a good wind behind it.""",6
2003-05-28,gwb,I want to thank Dirk and members of the Tax Relief Coalition who rallied the grassroots all across the country to remind Members of the House and the Senate that there are people out there that understand that with tax relief will come more jobs for the American people.,15
2003-05-28,gwb,I appreciate members of the roundtables we had all around America.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,I see a lot of familiar faces from people that allowed me to come and listen to their stories and then translate those stories into the public arena so that our Congresspeople and citizens knew that behind every number there was a story to be told.,11
2003-05-28,gwb,I see small-business entrepreneurs and taxpayers and people who need dividends to help with their retirement.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,All of them stood up as we went around the country and spoke clearly— much more clearly than I can—about the need for tax relief.,7
2003-05-28,gwb,And I appreciate you all being here.,2
2003-05-28,gwb,"And I want to thank you for your care for our country, and welcome to the White House.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,The Jobs and Growth Act reduces Federal income taxes across the board.,3
2003-05-28,gwb,"And today the Internal Revenue Service will post new withholding tax tables so that employers can begin leaving more money in the paychecks of American workers, starting next month.",7
2003-05-28,gwb,"The Jobs and Growth Act increases the per-child tax credit from $600 to $1,000.",3
2003-05-28,gwb,So today I'm directing the Department of Treasury to issue checks of up to $400 per child to 25 million eligible families.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,And those checks will begin arriving in July.,3
2003-05-28,gwb,"This combination of income-tax rate reductions, a higher child credit, and a reduction in the marriage penalty will make a difference for families in every part of this country.",8

2003-05-28,gwb,"But sometimes other bills have to be paid first, is what she says.",3
2003-05-28,gwb,"Under this proposal, under the bill I sign, it's going to be a lot easier for the Theisen family to save for the future because they will keep an extra $1,300 a year of their own money.",7

2003-05-28,gwb,"This tax bill will make it easier for moms and dads to save for their children's education, and that's vitally important for the future of this country.",7

2003-05-28,gwb,The bill also allows for dividend income to be taxed at a lower rate.,4
2003-05-28,gwb,"This will encourage more companies to pay dividends, which in itself will not only be good for investors but will be a corporate reform measure.",7
2003-05-28,gwb,It's hard to pay dividends unless you've actually got cashflow.,2
2003-05-28,gwb,"The days when people could say, ""Invest with me because the sky's the limit,"" will be changed by dividend policy.",5
2003-05-28,gwb,It's hard to promote the sky being the limit and pay dividends unless you're actually profitable and have cashflow.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,Getting—reducing the tax rate on dividends will also increase the wealth effect around America and will help our markets.,4

2003-05-28,gwb,"His savings under the tax relief will let him keep $7,300 of his own money, and his business will save at least $12,000 because of this legislation's increased expensing rules.",5
2003-05-28,gwb,"His savings, plus those of the other people who own this company, will help this company buy more equipment for their 50 employees, which will make the employees more productive, which will make it more likely that he'll be able to expand the number of employees who works for him.",14

2003-05-28,gwb,"Increased hiring happens gradually, but we're on the path to greater job creation across this country.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,We know that tax relief is going to help this economy because it has done so in the past.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,The tax relief we passed in 2001 helped make the recession one of the shallowest in American history.,7
2003-05-28,gwb,It gave millions of families needed relief during a difficult time for our country.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,It helped many entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams.,3
2003-05-28,gwb,"I recently got a letter from Rusty Loiselle, who lives in Illinois.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,"Rusty had seen some hard times, but he always had a dream to start his own business and to be his own boss.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,He says the tax relief in 2001 helped him create a small custom painting business.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,"He bought a computer, some airbrushes, lights, and sanders, and he's done well.",4
2003-05-28,gwb,He's done well enough to be able to buy himself a home for he and his son.,9
2003-05-28,gwb,"He said, ""It probably doesn't sound much like—sound like much to you all, but it means a lot to my son and me.""",5
2003-05-28,gwb,"That's what America's all about, providing opportunity.",4
2003-05-28,gwb,The bill I'm going to sign provides opportunity for millions of Americans across this country.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,"And the more opportunity there is, the more likely it is somebody is going to find work in this country.",7
2003-05-28,gwb,This legislation is a major step forward in our economic agenda.,3
2003-05-28,gwb,Yet other steps are also needed.,2
2003-05-28,gwb,We must hold Federal spending to a responsible level.,3
2003-05-28,gwb,"Our budget for this year calls for discretionary spending to rise only 4 percent, or as much as the average household income will go up this year.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,Government should follow the example of American families by setting clear priorities and by staying within them.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,We must act in other areas to ensure the economic security of American families and workers.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,There could be no economic security unless people can count on affordable health care.,4
2003-05-28,gwb,Critical measures before Congress would address this issue.,3
2003-05-28,gwb,"Our country must get a handle on rising health care costs, so we must pass reforms to end the junk lawsuits that drive good doctors out of practice and drive the costs up for everybody.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,The biggest threat to economic security of our seniors is the affordability of prescription drugs.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,We must make available a prescription drug benefit to all our seniors.,4
2003-05-28,gwb,And we must assure that the commitments of Medicare are kept to every future generation of Americans.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,"To enhance economic security for working people throughout the economy, we must reduce the burden of regulation and litigation on small businesses as well.",7
2003-05-28,gwb,Employers don't want to spend their time and resources filling out forms or fighting junk lawsuits.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,They want to be out on the shop floor or behind the cash register creating profits and jobs.,7
2003-05-28,gwb,And that is why this administration has launched a task force to find ways to reduce paperwork for small-business owners in America.,9
2003-05-28,gwb,"We must enact regulatory and lawsuit reforms so that our business owners can do what they do best, create jobs.",3
2003-05-28,gwb,We must also help build economic security for workers by preparing citizens to fill the new jobs this economy will create.,8
2003-05-28,gwb,We're aggressively implementing higher standards in our public schools so that every child—every child—learns to read and write and add and subtract.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,"We've increased funding for Pell grants, making higher education a possibility for more young Americans.",5
2003-05-28,gwb,I've proposed innovative reemployment accounts to help unemployed workers cover the cost of job training or relocation.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,"For those currently unemployed, earlier today I signed legislation extending unemployment insurance benefits for an additional 13 weeks.",5
2003-05-28,gwb,"And when we reauthorize welfare reform, we must make sure that more and more Americans are set on the path of work, which is the path of dignity and independence.",9
2003-05-28,gwb,"I'm confident we can make progress in all these areas, because the Congress is showing the good will and hard work that makes progress possible.",6
2003-05-28,gwb,Already we've achieved many of the goals that I outlined last January.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,"Congress passed a budget resolution that follows my call to restore spending discipline to Washington, DC.",7
2003-05-28,gwb,We passed a focused supplemental spending bill to support our brave men and women in uniform.,4
2003-05-28,gwb,We passed a Global AIDS Initiative to help millions of people fighting for their lives.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,And now we have passed a bold package of tax relief for America's families and businesses which will help turn our recovery into a lasting expansion that reaches every single corner of America.,9
2003-05-28,gwb,"I believe in the future of this economy, in our Nation, because I know the character of the American people.",5
2003-05-28,gwb,"In 20 months, Americans have been tested by a national emergency, corporate scandals, war, and recession.",5
2003-05-28,gwb,"And time after time, we've responded effectively to the challenges we have faced.",4
2003-05-28,gwb,"Time after time, Americans have shown a firm resolve and an unshakable faith in our future.",5
2003-05-28,gwb,"And now, with this bold legislation, we're sending a clear message to the doubters, the doubters that Washington can respond.",3
2003-05-28,gwb,We can respond.,1
2003-05-28,gwb,We can respond in a positive way.,3
2003-05-28,gwb,We're building on the strengths of our economy so that everybody who wants to work can find a job in this great country.,5
2003-05-28,gwb,Congratulations to the Members of the United States Congress for rising to the challenge.,6
2003-05-28,gwb,May God bless America.,1
2002-01-08,gwb,Thank you all very much.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,Okay.,1
2002-01-08,gwb,I know you all are anxious to get back to class.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,So please be seated.,1
2002-01-08,gwb,Thank you for such a warm welcome.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,"It's great to be in the home of the Big Blue, Hamilton High School.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,I want to thank you all for coming.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,"I particularly want to thank my friend the Governor of the great State of Ohio, Governor Taft, for being here.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,I want to thank Tracey Miller for being so hospitable.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,I want to thank all who have come to witness this historic moment.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,"For those of you who have studied the history of our Government, you know most bills are signed at the White House.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,"But I decided to sign this bill in one of the most important places in America, a public school.",9
2002-01-08,gwb,We've got large challenges here in America.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,"There's no greater challenge than to make sure that every child—and all of us on this stage mean every child, not just a few children—every single child, regardless of where they live, how they're raised, the income level of their family, every child receive a first-class education in America.",10
2002-01-08,gwb,"And as you know, we've got another challenge, and that's to protect America from evil ones.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,"And I want to assure the seniors and juniors and sophomores here at Hamilton High School that the effort that this great country is engaged in, the effort to defend freedom and to defend our people, the effort to rout out terror wherever it exists, is noble and just and right, and your great country will prevail in this effort.",8
2002-01-08,gwb,I long for peace.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,"But I also understand that if we do not lead the world against terror, that your children and your grandchildren will not grow up in a society that is as free as the society we have today.",9
2002-01-08,gwb,Freedom is the precious gift that one generation can pass to the next.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,It is a gift and a promise that I intend to keep to the American children.,7
2002-01-08,gwb,And we owe the children of America a good education.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,"And today begins a new era, a new time in public education in our country.",6
2002-01-08,gwb,"As of this hour, America's schools will be on a new path of reform and a new path of results.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,Our schools will have higher expectations.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,We believe every child can learn.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,Our schools will have greater resources to help meet those goals.,4
2002-01-08,gwb,Parents will have more information about the schools and more say in how their children are educated.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,"From this day forward, all students will have a better chance to learn, to excel, and to live out their dreams.",6
2002-01-08,gwb,"I want to thank the Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, for being here and for his leadership.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,"I asked Rod to join my administration because I wanted somebody who understood what it meant to run a school district in Washington, DC.",9
2002-01-08,gwb,I didn't need somebody that based his knowledge on theory; I wanted somebody who based his knowledge on experience.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,"And Rod was a teacher, a school board member, and the superintendent of the Houston Independent School District.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,"He did a fine job there, and he's doing a fine job in Washington.",3
2002-01-08,gwb,"Reaching this moment has not been easy, as you could tell from Chairman Boehner's discussion.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,But we made it because of the willingness of four fine leaders to do what was right for America.,7
2002-01-08,gwb,"We made it because proud Members of the House and the Senate, loyal to their parties, decided to set partisan politics aside and focus on what was right for America.",8
2002-01-08,gwb,I want to thank George Miller.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,"I call him Big George, Jorge el Grande.",3
2002-01-08,gwb,"As John mentioned, George and I aren't from the same political ideology; except when I met with George in Austin, I could tell he shares the same passion I share for making sure that every child gets educated.",9
2002-01-08,gwb,"And he, like me and others, realize that a system that simply shuffles children through the schools is a system that's going to leave people behind, and so we made up our minds right then and there to do something about it.",6
2002-01-08,gwb,I appreciate so very much my friend Judd Gregg from the State of New Hampshire being here.,7
2002-01-08,gwb,He was my campaign manager in the New Hampshire primary.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,I still invited him to come with me.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,"After here, we're going to New Hampshire.",3
2002-01-08,gwb,"I look forward to singing Judd's praises because he is a solid, solid United States Senator, honest, full of integrity, and like the others here, he buckled down to do what was right for the children.",8
2002-01-08,gwb,"And then, of course, there's Senator Edward Kennedy.",2
2002-01-08,gwb,And the folks at the Crawford coffee shop——would be somewhat shocked when I told them I actually like the fellow.,4
2002-01-08,gwb,He is a fabulous United States Senator.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,"When he's against you, it's tough; when he's with you, it is a great experience.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,"And I'm signing this bill here because it's the home of the chairman, John Boehner.",6
2002-01-08,gwb,John did a really good job.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,He shepherded the process.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,He made sure people showed up for the meetings.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,He was dogged in his determination to get this bill done.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,It would not have happened without his leadership.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,And all four of these Members up here need to be proud of the legacy they have left behind.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,"This is a good bill for the American children, and I'm proud to sign it in their presence.",6
2002-01-08,gwb,"There are other Members of the Congress who are here, as well, and I want to thank them for coming.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,Senator Evan Bayh from the State of Indiana is here.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,"Evan, thank you for your leadership on education reform.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,"Senator Mike DeWine of your State of Ohio, who helped author— who helped to author the safe and drug-free schools part of this bill, thank you for your leadership.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,"Steve Chabot of Ohio, Van Hilleary of Tennessee, thank you both for coming, as well.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,In that box is the bill.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,I don't intend to read it all.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,It's not exactly light reading.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,"But if you were to read it all, you would find that it contains some very important principles that will help guide our public school system for the next decades.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,First principle is accountability.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,"Every school has a job to do, and that's to teach the basics and teach them well.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,"If we want to make sure no child is left behind, every child must learn to read, and every child must learn to add and subtract.",6
2002-01-08,gwb,"So in return for Federal dollars, we are asking States to design accountability systems to show parents and teachers whether or not children can read and write and add and subtract in grades three through eight.",8
2002-01-08,gwb,"The fundamental principle of this bill is that every child can learn, we expect every child to learn, and you must show us whether or not every child is learning.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,I read a quote one time from a young lady in New York.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,"She said, ""I don't ever remember taking an exam.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,They just kept passing me along.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,I ended up dropping out in the seventh grade.,4
2002-01-08,gwb,"I basically felt nobody cared.""",2
2002-01-08,gwb,The story of children being just shuffled through the system is one of the saddest stories of America.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,"""Let's just move them through.""",2
2002-01-08,gwb,It's so much easier to move a child through than trying to figure out how to solve a child's problems.,9
2002-01-08,gwb,The first step to making sure that a child is not shuffled through is to test that child as to whether or not he or she can read and write or add and subtract.,7
2002-01-08,gwb,The first way to solve a problem is to diagnose it.,4
2002-01-08,gwb,"And so, what this bill says, it says every child can learn.",3
2002-01-08,gwb,"And we want to know early, before it's too late, whether or not a child has a problem in learning.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,I understand taking tests aren't fun.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,Too bad.,1
2002-01-08,gwb,We need to know in America.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,We need to know whether or not children have got the basic education.,4
2002-01-08,gwb,No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,No longer is it acceptable to keep results away from parents.,4
2002-01-08,gwb,"One of the interesting things about this bill, it says that we're never going to give up on a school that's performing poorly, that when we find poor performance, a school will be given time and incentives and resources to correct their problems.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,"A school will be given time to try other methodologies, perhaps other leadership, to make sure that people can succeed.",6
2002-01-08,gwb,"If, however, schools don't perform, if, however, given the new resources, focused resources, they are unable to solve the problem of not educating their children, there must be real consequences.",8
2002-01-08,gwb,"There must be a moment in which parents can say, ""I've had enough of this school.""",7
2002-01-08,gwb,Parents must be given real options in the face of failure in order to make sure reform is meaningful.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,"And so, therefore, this bill's second principle is, is that we trust parents to make the right decisions for their children.",6
2002-01-08,gwb,"Any school that doesn't perform, any school that cannot catch up and do its job, a parent will have these options: a better public school, a tutor, or a charter school.",6
2002-01-08,gwb,We do not want children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,"The third principle of this bill is that we have got to trust the local folks on how to achieve standards, to meet the standards.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,"In Washington, there's some smart people there, but the people who care most about the children in Hamilton are the citizens of Hamilton.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,The people who care most about the children in this school are the teachers and parents and school board members.,7
2002-01-08,gwb,"And therefore, schools not only have the responsibility to improve; they now have the freedom to improve.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,The Federal Government will not micromanage how schools are run.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,We believe strongly— we believe strongly the best path to education reform is to trust the local people.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,"And so the new role of the Federal Government is to set high standards, provide resources, hold people accountable, and liberate school districts to meet the standards.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,"I can't think of any better way to say to teachers, ""We trust you.""",5
2002-01-08,gwb,"And first of all, we've got to thank all the teachers who are here.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,I thank you for teaching.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,"Yours is indeed a noble profession, and our society is better off because you decided to teach.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,"And by saying we trust local folks, we're really saying we trust you.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,We trust you.,1
2002-01-08,gwb,We want you to have as much flexibility as possible to see to it that every child that walks in your classroom can succeed.,9
2002-01-08,gwb,So thank you for what you do.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,"And a fourth principle is that we're going to spend more money, more resources, but they'll be directed at methods that work, not feel-good methods, not sound-good methods, but methods that actually work, particularly when it comes to reading.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,"We're going to spend more on our schools, and we're going to spend it more wisely.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,"If we've learned anything over the last generations, money alone doesn't make a good school.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,It certainly helps.,1
2002-01-08,gwb,"But as John mentioned, we've spent billions of dollars with lousy results.",3
2002-01-08,gwb,So now it's time to spend billions of dollars and get good results.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,"As John mentioned, too many of our kids can't read.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,"You know, a huge percentage of children in poverty can't read at grade level.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,That's not right in America.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,"We're going to win the war overseas, and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home, as well.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,And so this bill—so this bill focuses on reading.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,It sets a grand goal for the country: Our children will be reading by the third grade.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,That's not an impossible goal.,2
2002-01-08,gwb,It's a goal we must meet if we want every child to succeed.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,"And so, therefore, we tripled the amount of Federal funding for scientifically based early reading programs.",7
2002-01-08,gwb,We've got money in there to make sure teachers know how to teach what works.,6
2002-01-08,gwb,We've got money in there to help promote proven methods of instruction.,5
2002-01-08,gwb,"There are no more excuses, as far as I'm concerned, about not teaching children how to read.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,"We know what works, the money is now available, and it's up to each local district to make sure it happens.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,"It's up to you, the citizens of Hamilton, to make sure no child is left behind.",5
2002-01-08,gwb,"And the Federal Government can spend money, and we can help set standards, and we can insist upon accountability.",4
2002-01-08,gwb,"But the truth of the matter is, our schools will flourish when citizens join in the noble cause of making sure no child is left behind.",10
2002-01-08,gwb,This is the end of a legislative process.,4
2002-01-08,gwb,"Signing this bill is the end of a long, long time of people sitting in rooms trying to hammer out differences.",11
2002-01-08,gwb,It's a great symbol of what is possible in Washington when good people come together to do what's right.,7
2002-01-08,gwb,But it's just the beginning of change.,3
2002-01-08,gwb,"And now it's up to you, the local citizens of our great land, the compassionate, decent citizens of America, to stand up and demand high standards, and to demand that no child—not one single child in America—is left behind.",9
2002-01-08,gwb,Thank you for letting us come.,4
2002-01-08,gwb,May God bless.,1
2003-11-05,gwb,Thank you very much.,2
2003-11-05,gwb,Good afternoon.,1
2003-11-05,gwb,I'm pleased that all of you have joined us as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 becomes the law of the land.,7
2003-11-05,gwb,"For years, a terrible form of violence has been directed against children who are inches from birth, while the law looked the other way.",6
2003-11-05,gwb,"Today, at last, the American people and our Government have confronted the violence and come to the defense of the innocent child.",6
2003-11-05,gwb,I want to thank you all for coming.,3
2003-11-05,gwb,"Many of you have worked long and hard to see this bill come to fruition, and we thank you for your efforts.",4
2003-11-05,gwb,I see some members of my Cabinet have come.,5
2003-11-05,gwb,"I appreciate the good work of the Attorney General, John Ashcroft.",5

2003-11-05,gwb,"Thank you, Tommy.",1

2003-11-05,gwb,I'm thankful that our Speaker is with us today.,4
2003-11-05,gwb,"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate you coming.",2
2003-11-05,gwb,"The majority leader, Tom DeLay, as well— thank you for coming, Tom.",3
2003-11-05,gwb,I'd like to mention three other Members of the House.,5
2003-11-05,gwb,Henry Hyde is with us today.,2

2003-11-05,gwb,"I appreciate His Eminence, Cardinal Egan, who's with us today.",4
2003-11-05,gwb,"Thank you very much, sir.",2
2003-11-05,gwb,"In passing this legislation, Members of the House and Senate made a studied decision based upon compelling evidence.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,The best case against partial-birth abortion is a simple description of what happens and to whom it happens.,6
2003-11-05,gwb,"It involves the partial delivery of a live boy or girl and a sudden, violent end of that life.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,Our Nation owes its children a different and better welcome.,3
2003-11-05,gwb,The bill I am about to sign protecting innocent new life from this practice reflects the compassion and humanity of America.,8
2003-11-05,gwb,"In the course of the congressional debate, the facts became clear.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,"Each year, thousands of partial-birth abortions are committed.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,"As Dr. C. Everett Koop, the pediatrician and former Surgeon General, has pointed out, the majority of partial-birth abortions are not required by medical emergency.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,"As Congress has found, the practice is widely regarded within the medical profession as unnecessary, not only cruel to the child but harmful to the mother and a violation of medical ethics.",6
2003-11-05,gwb,"The facts about partial-birth abortion are troubling and tragic, and no lawyer's brief can make them seem otherwise.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,"By acting to prevent this practice, the elected branches of our Government have affirmed a basic standard of humanity, the duty of the strong to protect the weak.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,"The wide agreement amongst men and women on this issue, regardless of political party, shows that bitterness in political debate can be overcome by compassion and the power of conscience.",6
2003-11-05,gwb,And the executive branch will vigorously defend this law against any who would try to overturn it in the courts.,7
2003-11-05,gwb,"America stands for liberty, for the pursuit of happiness, and for the unalienable right of life.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,And the most basic duty of Government is to defend the life of the innocent.,5
2003-11-05,gwb,"Every person, however frail or vulnerable, has a place and a purpose in this world.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,Every person has a special dignity.,2
2003-11-05,gwb,"This right to life cannot be granted or denied by Government, because it does not come from Government.",3
2003-11-05,gwb,It comes from the Creator of life.,4
2003-11-05,gwb,"In the debate about the rights of the unborn, we are asked to broaden the circle of our moral concern.",7
2003-11-05,gwb,We're asked to live out our calling as Americans.,4
2003-11-05,gwb,"We're asked to honor our own standards, announced on the day of our founding in the Declaration of Independence.",9
2003-11-05,gwb,We're asked by our convictions and tradition and compassion to build a culture of life and make this a more just and welcoming society.,5
2003-11-05,gwb,And today we welcome vulnerable children into the care and protection of Americans.,4
2003-11-05,gwb,"The late Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey once said that when we look to the unborn child, the real issue is not when life begins but when love begins.",5
2003-11-05,gwb,This is the generous and merciful spirit of our country at its best.,4
2003-11-05,gwb,"This spirit is reflected in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which I am now honored to sign into law.",6
2003-11-05,gwb,God bless.,1
2003-11-05,gwb,Thank you all.,2
2006-10-26,gwb,Thank you all.,2
2006-10-26,gwb,Thank you.,1
2006-10-26,gwb,Please be seated.,1
2006-10-26,gwb,I'm pleased that you all are here to witness the signature of the Secure Fence Act of 2006.,8
2006-10-26,gwb,This bill will help protect the American people.,3
2006-10-26,gwb,This bill will make our borders more secure.,3
2006-10-26,gwb,It is an important step toward immigration reform.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,I want to thank the Members of Congress for their work on this important piece of legislation.,7
2006-10-26,gwb,I welcome you here to the White House.,3
2006-10-26,gwb,I'm looking forward to signing this bill.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,I appreciate the Vice President joining us today.,3

2006-10-26,gwb,"I appreciate you being here, Peter.",2
2006-10-26,gwb,Ours is a nation of immigrants.,3
2006-10-26,gwb,We're also a nation of law.,3
2006-10-26,gwb,"Unfortunately, the United States has not been in complete control of its borders for decades, and therefore, illegal immigration has been on the rise.",5
2006-10-26,gwb,We have a responsibility to address these challenges.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,We have a responsibility to enforce our laws.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,We have a responsibility to secure our borders.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,We take this responsibility seriously.,2
2006-10-26,gwb,"Earlier this year, I addressed the Nation from the Oval Office.",4
2006-10-26,gwb,I laid out our strategy for immigration reform.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,Part of that strategy begins with securing the border.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,"Since I took office, we have more than doubled funding for border security—from $4.6 billion in 2001 to $10.4 billion this year.",5
2006-10-26,gwb,"We've increased the number of Border Patrol agents from about 9,000 to more than 12,000, and by the end of 2008, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents during my Presidency.",6
2006-10-26,gwb,We've deployed thousands of National Guard members to assist the Border Patrol.,5
2006-10-26,gwb,We've upgraded technology at our borders.,3
2006-10-26,gwb,"We've added infrastructure, including new fencing and vehicle barriers.",5
2006-10-26,gwb,We're adding thousands of new beds in our detention facilities so we can continue working to end catch-and-release at our southern border.,7
2006-10-26,gwb,"During the course of my administration, we have apprehended and sent home more than 6 million people entering our country illegally.",5
2006-10-26,gwb,And I thank the Border Patrol for their hard work.,3
2006-10-26,gwb,The Secure Fence Act builds on this progress.,3
2006-10-26,gwb,The bill authorizes the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along our southern border.,10
2006-10-26,gwb,"The bill authorizes more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting to help prevent people from entering our country illegally.",9
2006-10-26,gwb,The bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology like cameras and satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce our infrastructure at the border.,9
2006-10-26,gwb,We're modernizing the southern border of the United States so we can assure the American people we're doing our job of securing the border.,8
2006-10-26,gwb,"By making wise use of physical barriers and deploying 21st century technology, we're helping our Border Patrol agents do their job.",6
2006-10-26,gwb,The Secure Fence Act is part of our efforts to reform our immigration system.,6
2006-10-26,gwb,We have more to do.,3
2006-10-26,gwb,Meaningful immigration reform means that we must enforce our immigration laws in the United States.,5
2006-10-26,gwb,It is against the law to hire someone who is here illegally.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,"We fully understand that most businesses want to obey that law, but they cannot verify the legal status of their employees because of widespread document fraud.",5
2006-10-26,gwb,"So we're creating a better system for verifying documents and work eligibility and, in the meantime, holding people to account for breaking the law.",6
2006-10-26,gwb,We must reduce pressure on our border by creating a temporary-worker plan.,5
2006-10-26,gwb,Willing workers ought to be matched with willing employers to do jobs Americans are not doing for a temporary—on a temporary basis.,7
2006-10-26,gwb,We must face the reality that millions of illegal immigrants are already here.,6
2006-10-26,gwb,They should not be given an automatic path to citizenship; that is amnesty.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,I oppose amnesty.,1
2006-10-26,gwb,There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic pass to citizenship for every illegal immigrant and a program of mass deportation.,9
2006-10-26,gwb,And I look forward to working with Congress to find that middle ground.,4
2006-10-26,gwb,The bill I'm about to sign is an important step in our Nation's efforts to secure our border and reform our immigration system.,7
2006-10-26,gwb,I want to thank the Members of Congress for joining me as I sign the Secure Fence Act of 2006.,7
2005-02-14,gwb,Good morning.,1

2005-02-14,gwb,"For the past decade, Al has been a close adviser, an honorable public servant, and a dear friend.",4
2005-02-14,gwb,Now he assumes a new title.,2
2005-02-14,gwb,"Today it is my honor to call this son of Humble, Texas, the 80th Attorney General of the United States.",8

2005-02-14,gwb,"I thank the other distinguished guests who are here, and I thank the Texans who have come up.",4
2005-02-14,gwb,"As Attorney General Gonzales begins his service, he will build on the outstanding work of Attorney General John Ashcroft.",6
2005-02-14,gwb,"Over the past 4 years, Attorney General Ashcroft has started the Department of Justice on the right course in the war on terror.",6
2005-02-14,gwb,He's helped reduce violent crime to a 30-year low.,5
2005-02-14,gwb,He's taken vital new steps to protect children from exploitation.,4
2005-02-14,gwb,"John Ashcroft has worked tirelessly to make our Nation safer and more just, and America is thankful for your lifetime of service.",6
2005-02-14,gwb,Attorney General Gonzales now joins every employee at the Department of Justice in an urgent mission to protect the United States from another terrorist attack.,6
2005-02-14,gwb,Few periods in our history have demanded so much of this Department.,4
2005-02-14,gwb,"With Al's principled leadership, the Department of Justice will continue this important mission and will defend the security of all Americans and the liberty of all Americans.",8
2005-02-14,gwb,"The men and women of this Department are meeting your duty every day, from your headquarters in Washington to U.S. attorneys offices across the country, to dangerous posts overseas.",5
2005-02-14,gwb,You've reorganized your resources to confront the threats of this new war.,5
2005-02-14,gwb,You've devised effective methods to investigate and prosecute terrorists.,4
2005-02-14,gwb,Some of you have volunteered for demanding new duties in complex areas such as intelligence and counterterrorism.,8
2005-02-14,gwb,"Our Nation is grateful for your dedication and sacrifice, and in return, we must provide you all the tools you need to do your job.",6
2005-02-14,gwb,"And one of those tools is the PATRIOT Act, which has been vital to our success in tracking terrorists and disrupting their plans.",10
2005-02-14,gwb,Many key elements of the PATRIOT Act are now set to expire at the end of this year.,6
2005-02-14,gwb,We must not allow the passage of time or the illusion of safety to weaken our resolve in this new war.,7
2005-02-14,gwb,"To protect the American people, Congress must promptly renew all provisions of the PATRIOT Act this year.",4
2005-02-14,gwb,Your mission to ensure equal justice for every American extends far beyond the war on terror.,6
2005-02-14,gwb,"By aggressively prosecuting gun criminals and drug dealers, you make neighborhoods safer for all families.",5
2005-02-14,gwb,"By holding corporate wrongdoers to account, you build confidence in our economy.",4
2005-02-14,gwb,"By protecting victims of child abuse and domestic violence, you help guarantee a compassionate society.",7
2005-02-14,gwb,"And by defending the civil rights of every American, you affirm the dignity of every life and you set an example of liberty for the entire world.",6
2005-02-14,gwb,"As we strive to provide equal justice, we must ensure that Americans of all races and backgrounds trust the legal system.",5
2005-02-14,gwb,"By spreading the use of DNA analysis, we can solve more crimes, lock up more criminals, and prevent wrongful conviction.",6
2005-02-14,gwb,So I've asked Congress for more than a billion dollars over 5 years to expand this vital technology.,4
2005-02-14,gwb,"And to help ensure that the death penalty is applied justly, I've also requested new funding to train prosecutors, judges, and defense counsels in capital cases.",7
2005-02-14,gwb,"To maintain confidence in the legal system, we must ensure that judges faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench.",5
2005-02-14,gwb,I've a constitutional responsibility to nominate well-qualified men and women for the Federal courts.,5
2005-02-14,gwb,I have done so.,1
2005-02-14,gwb,And I've benefited greatly from the sound judgment of Attorney General Gonzales on picking qualified people to serve on our benches.,6
2005-02-14,gwb,I will continue to rely on his advice.,4
2005-02-14,gwb,And the United States Senate must also live up to its constitutional responsibility.,3
2005-02-14,gwb,Every judicial nominee deserves a prompt hearing and an up-or-down vote on the floor of the United States Senate.,8
2005-02-14,gwb,"As he embarks on all these duties, Attorney General Gonzales has my complete confidence.",4
2005-02-14,gwb,"From his early days of selling soda at Rice University football games to his time in the Air Force to his distinguished legal career and service on the White House staff, Al has been a model of courage and character to his fellow citizens.",10
2005-02-14,gwb,"I've witnessed his integrity, his decency, his deep dedication to the cause of justice.",5
2005-02-14,gwb,Now he will advance that cause as the Attorney General and ensure that more Americans have the opportunity to achieve their dreams.,6

2005-01-28,gwb,I don't know if you're supposed to say that about the Secretary of State.,6
2005-01-28,gwb,Condi—appointment and confirmation of Secretary of State marks a remarkable transition in what is already a career of outstanding service and accomplishment.,7

2005-01-28,gwb,"His magnificent wife, Alma, I am certain is pleased that a grateful nation is giving back her husband——and all of us admire and appreciate the service of Colin Powell.",8
2005-01-28,gwb,I appreciate the fact that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg administered the oath.,5
2005-01-28,gwb,It was neighborly of her to do that.,3
2005-01-28,gwb,"I want to thank Congresswoman Jane Harman from California for joining us, as well as Juanita Millender-McDonald from California.",4

2005-01-28,gwb,"Colin Powell leaves big shoes to fill at the State Department, but Condi Rice is the right person to fill them.",4

2005-01-28,gwb,Condi has an abiding belief in the power of democracy to secure justice and liberty and the inclusion of men and women of all races and religions in the courses that free nations chart for themselves.,13

2005-09-29,gwb,"In a few moments, John Roberts will take his place in a distinguished line that began in 1789, when President Washington appointed Chief Justice John Jay.",8

2005-09-29,gwb,"As a member of the Federal judiciary, John Roberts has carried out his duties with discernment and humanity and without fear or favor.",5
2005-09-29,gwb,"As Judge Roberts prepares to lead the judicial branch of Government, all Americans can be confident that the 17th Chief Justice of the United States will be prudent in exercising judicial power, firm in defending judicial independence, and above all, a faithful guardian of the Constitution.",10
2005-09-29,gwb,"With these qualities, the incoming Chief Justice will carry on in the tradition of his mentor and friend, the late William H. Rehnquist.",5
2005-09-29,gwb,I know that Chief Justice Rehnquist had hoped to welcome his former law clerk as a colleague.,5
2005-09-29,gwb,"Although that was not meant to be, we are thinking of William Rehnquist today.",3
2005-09-29,gwb,"The Nation honors his memory, and we remain grateful for his example of integrity and service.",7

2005-09-29,gwb,The process we have just completed epitomizes the separation of powers that is enshrined in our Constitution.,7
2005-09-29,gwb,"My nomination was announced some 10 weeks ago here in the White House, the home of the executive branch.",5
2005-09-29,gwb,"This morning, further up Pennsylvania Avenue, it was approved in the Capitol, the home of the executive branch.",6
2005-09-29,gwb,"And tomorrow, I will go into the Supreme Court building to join my colleagues, the home of the judicial branch, to undertake my duties.",6
2005-09-29,gwb,The executive and the legislature have carried out their constitutional responsibilities and ensured the succession of authority and responsibility in the judicial branch.,5
2005-09-29,gwb,"What Daniel Webster termed ""the miracle of our Constitution"" is not something that happens every generation.",4
2005-09-29,gwb,But every generation in its turn must accept the responsibility of supporting and defending the Constitution and bearing true faith and allegiance to it.,7
2005-09-29,gwb,That is the oath that I just took.,3

2007-11-27,gwb,"Prime Minister Olmert, President Abbas, Secretary-General Ban, former Prime Minister Blair, distinguished guests: Welcome to one of the finest institutes we have in America, the United States Naval Academy.",7
2007-11-27,gwb,We appreciate you joining us in what I believe is an historic opportunity to encourage the expansion of freedom and peace in the Holy Land.,10
2007-11-27,gwb,"We meet to lay the foundation for the establishment of a new nation, a democratic Palestinian state that will live side by side with Israel in peace and security.",10
2007-11-27,gwb,We meet to help bring an end to the violence that has been the true enemy of the aspirations of both the Israelis and Palestinians.,11
2007-11-27,gwb,We're off to a strong start.,4
2007-11-27,gwb,I'm about to read a statement that was agreed upon by our distinguished guests.,7
2007-11-27,gwb,"""The representatives of the Government of the State of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, represented respective by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas in his capacity as Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee and President of the Palestinian Authority, have convened in Annapolis, Maryland, under the auspices of President George W. Bush of the United States of America, and with the support of the participants of this international conference, having concluded the following joint understanding.",10
2007-11-27,gwb,"""We express our determination to bring an end to bloodshed, suffering, and decades of conflict between our peoples; to usher in a new era of peace, based on freedom, security, justice, dignity, respect, and mutual recognition; to propagate a culture of peace and nonviolence; to confront terrorism and incitement, whether committed by Palestinians or Israelis.",12
2007-11-27,gwb,"In furtherance of the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, we agree to immediately launch good-faith bilateral negotiations in order to conclude a peace treaty, resolving all outstanding issues, including all core issues, without exception, as specified in previous agreements.",8
2007-11-27,gwb,"""We agree to engage in vigorous, ongoing, and continuous negotiations and shall make every effort to conclude an agreement before the end of 2008.",8
2007-11-27,gwb,"For this purpose, a steering committee, led jointly by the head of the delegation of each party, will meet continuously, as agreed.",9
2007-11-27,gwb,"The steering committee will develop a joint work plan and establish and oversee the work of negotiations teams to address all issues, to be headed by one lead representative from each party.",10
2007-11-27,gwb,The first session of the steering committee will be held on 12 December 2007.,4
2007-11-27,gwb,"""President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert will continue to meet on a biweekly basis to follow up the negotiations in order to offer all necessary assistance for their advancement.",9
2007-11-27,gwb,"""The parties also commit to immediately implement their respective obligations under the performance-based roadmap to a permanent two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, issued by the Quartet on 30 April 2003—this is called the roadmap—and agree to form an American, Palestinian, and Israeli mechanism, led by the United States, to follow up on the implementation of the roadmap.",10
2007-11-27,gwb,"""The parties further commit to continue the implementation of the ongoing obligations of the roadmap until they reach a peace treaty.",7
2007-11-27,gwb,The United States will monitor and judge the fulfillment of the commitment of both sides of the roadmap.,9
2007-11-27,gwb,"Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, implementation of the future peace treaty will be subject to the implementation of the roadmap as judged by the United States.""",7
2007-11-27,gwb,Congratulations for your strong leadership.,3
2007-11-27,gwb,The Palestinian people are blessed with many gifts and talents.,3
2007-11-27,gwb,They want the opportunity to use those gifts to better their own lives and build a future for their children.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,They want the dignity that comes with sovereignty and independence.,5
2007-11-27,gwb,They want justice and equality under the rule of law.,5
2007-11-27,gwb,They want freedom from violence and fear.,4
2007-11-27,gwb,The people of Israel have just aspirations as well.,3
2007-11-27,gwb,They want their children to be able to ride a bus or to go to school without fear of suicide bombers.,9
2007-11-27,gwb,They want an end to rocket attacks and constant threats of assault.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,They want their nation to be recognized and welcomed in the region where they live.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,"Today, Palestinians and Israelis each understand that helping the other to realize their aspirations is key to realizing their own aspirations, both require an independent, democratic, viable Palestinian state.",7
2007-11-27,gwb,Such a state will provide Palestinians with the chance to lead lives of freedom and purpose and dignity.,8
2007-11-27,gwb,Such a state will help provide the Israelis with something they have been seeking for generations: to live in peace with their neighbors.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,Achieving this goal is not going to be easy.,3
2007-11-27,gwb,"If it were easy, it would have happened a long time ago.",3
2007-11-27,gwb,"To achieve freedom and peace, both Israelis and Palestinians will have to make tough choices.",3
2007-11-27,gwb,"Both sides are sober about the work ahead, but having spent time with their leaders, they are ready to take on the tough issues.",5
2007-11-27,gwb,"As Prime Minister Olmert recently put it: ""We will avoid none of the historic questions; we will not run from discussing any of them.""",5
2007-11-27,gwb,"As President Abbas has said: ""I believe that there is an opportunity not only for us but for the Israelis too.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,"We have a historic and important opportunity that we must benefit from.""",4
2007-11-27,gwb,It is with that spirit that we concluded—that they concluded this statement I just read.,4
2007-11-27,gwb,Our purpose here in Annapolis is not to conclude an agreement.,4
2007-11-27,gwb,"Rather, it is to launch negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,"For the rest of us, our job is to encourage the parties in this effort and to give them the support they need to succeed.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,"In light of recent developments, some have suggested that now is not the right time to pursue peace.",5
2007-11-27,gwb,I disagree.,1
2007-11-27,gwb,I believe now is precisely the right time to begin these negotiations for a number of reasons.,7
2007-11-27,gwb,"First, the time is right because Palestinians and Israelis have leaders who are determined to achieve peace.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,"President Abbas seeks to fulfill his people's aspirations for statehood, dignity, and security.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,President Abbas understands that a Palestinian state will not be born of terror and that terrorism is the enemy standing in the way of a state.,9
2007-11-27,gwb,"He and Prime Minister Fayyad have both declared, without hesitation, that they are opposed to terrorism and committed to peace.",5
2007-11-27,gwb,They're committed to turning these declarations into actions on the ground to combat terror.,8
2007-11-27,gwb,The emergence of responsible Palestinian leaders has given Israeli leaders the confidence they need to reach out to the Palestinians in true partnership.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,Prime Minister Olmert has expressed his understanding of the suffering and indignities felt by the Palestinian people.,4
2007-11-27,gwb,"He's made clear that the security of Israel will be enhanced by the establishment of a responsible, democratic Palestinian state.",7
2007-11-27,gwb,"With leaders of courage and conviction on both sides, now is the time to come together and seek the peace that both sides desire.",7
2007-11-27,gwb,"Second, the time is right because a battle is underway for the future of the Middle East, and we must not cede victory to the extremists.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,"With their violent actions and contempt for human life, the extremists are seeking to impose a dark vision on the Palestinian people, a vision that feeds on hopelessness and despair to sow chaos in the Holy Land.",7
2007-11-27,gwb,"If this vision prevails, the future of the region will be endless terror, endless war, and endless suffering.",4
2007-11-27,gwb,Standing against this dark vision are President Abbas and his Government.,3
2007-11-27,gwb,"They are offering the Palestinian people an alternative vision for the future: a vision of peace, a homeland of their own, and a better life.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,"If responsible Palestinian leaders can deliver on this vision, they will deal the forces of extremism a devastating blow.",4
2007-11-27,gwb,"And when liberty takes root in the rocky soil of the West Bank and Gaza, it will inspire millions across the Middle East who want their societies built on freedom and peace and hope.",7
2007-11-27,gwb,"By contrast, if Palestinian reformers cannot deliver on this hopeful vision, then the forces of extremism and terror will be strengthened, a generation of Palestinians could be lost to the extremists, and the Middle East will grow in despair.",5
2007-11-27,gwb,We cannot allow this to happen.,2
2007-11-27,gwb,Now is the time to show Palestinians that their dream of a free and independent state can be achieved at the table of peace and that the terror and violence preached by Palestinian extremists is the greatest obstacle to a Palestinian state.,9
2007-11-27,gwb,"Third, the time is right because the world understands the urgency of supporting these negotiations.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,"We appreciate that representatives from so many governments and international institutions have come to join us here in Annapolis, especially the Arab world.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,We're here because we recognize what is at stake.,4
2007-11-27,gwb,We are here because we each have a vital role to play in helping Palestinians forge the institutions of a free society.,10
2007-11-27,gwb,We're here because we understand that the success of these efforts to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians will have an impact far beyond the Holy Land.,10
2007-11-27,gwb,"These are the reasons we've gathered here in Annapolis, and now we begin the difficult work of freedom and peace.",5
2007-11-27,gwb,"The United States is proud to host this meeting, and we reaffirm the path to peace set out in the roadmap.",8
2007-11-27,gwb,"Yet in the end, the outcome of the negotiations they launch here depends on the Israelis and Palestinians themselves.",5
2007-11-27,gwb,"America will do everything in our power to support their quest for peace, but we cannot achieve it for them.",4
2007-11-27,gwb,The success of these efforts will require that all parties show patience and flexibility and meet their responsibilities.,4
2007-11-27,gwb,"For these negotiations to succeed, the Palestinians must do their part.",3
2007-11-27,gwb,"They must show the world they understand that while the borders of a Palestinian state are important, the nature of a Palestinian state is just as important.",7
2007-11-27,gwb,They must demonstrate that a Palestinian state will create opportunity for all its citizens and govern justly and dismantle the infrastructure of terror.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,"They must show that a Palestinian state will accept its responsibility and have the capability to be a source of stability and peace for its own citizens, for the people of Israel, and for the whole region.",8
2007-11-27,gwb,The Israelis must do their part.,2
2007-11-27,gwb,They must show the world that they are ready to begin—to bring an end to the occupation that began in 1967 through a negotiated settlement.,10
2007-11-27,gwb,"This settlement will establish Palestine as a Palestinian homeland, just as Israel is a homeland for the Jewish people.",5
2007-11-27,gwb,"Israel must demonstrate its support for the creation of a prosperous and successful Palestinian state by removing unauthorized outposts, ending settlement expansion, and finding other ways for the Palestinian Authority to exercise its responsibilities without compromising Israel's security.",11
2007-11-27,gwb,Arab States also have a vital role to play.,3
2007-11-27,gwb,Relaunching the Arab League initiative and the Arab League's support for today's conference are positive steps.,7
2007-11-27,gwb,All Arab States should show their strong support for the Government of President Abbas and provide needed assistance to the Palestinian Authority.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,"Arab States should also reach out to Israel, work toward the normalization of relations, and demonstrate in both word and deed that they believe that Israel and its people have a permanent home in the Middle East.",8
2007-11-27,gwb,These are vital steps toward the comprehensive peace that we all seek.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,"Finally, the international community has important responsibilities.",2
2007-11-27,gwb,"Prime Minister Fayyad is finalizing a plan to increase openness and transparency and accountability throughout Palestinian society, and he needs the resources and support from the international community.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,"With strong backing from those gathered here, the Palestinian Government can build the free institutions that will support a free Palestinian state.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,The United States will help Palestinian leaders build these free institutions.,3
2007-11-27,gwb,And the United States will keep its commitment to the security of Israel as a Jewish state and homeland for the Jewish people.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,"The United States strongly feels that these efforts will yield the peace that we want, and that is why we will continue to support the Lebanese people.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,We believe democracy brings peace.,2
2007-11-27,gwb,And democracy in Lebanon is vital as well for the peace in the Middle East.,5
2007-11-27,gwb,Lebanese people are in the process of electing a President.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,"That decision is for the Lebanese people to make, and they must be able to do so free from outside interference and intimidation.",7
2007-11-27,gwb,"As they embark on this process, the people of Lebanon can know that the American people stand with them, and we look forward to the day when the people of Lebanon can enjoy the blessings of liberty without fear of violence or coercion.",9
2007-11-27,gwb,The task begun here at Annapolis will be difficult.,5
2007-11-27,gwb,"This is the beginning of the process, not the end of it, and no doubt a lot of work remains to be done.",6
2007-11-27,gwb,Yet the parties can approach this work with confidence.,2
2007-11-27,gwb,The time is right.,2
2007-11-27,gwb,The cause is just.,2
2007-11-27,gwb,"And with hard effort, I know they can succeed.",3
2007-11-27,gwb,"President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert, I pledge to devote my effort during my time as President to do all I can to help you achieve this ambitious goal.",8
2007-11-27,gwb,I give you my personal commitment to support your work with the resources and resolve of the American Government.,8
2007-11-27,gwb,I believe a day is coming when freedom will yield the peace we desire.,6
2007-11-27,gwb,And the land that is holy to so many will see the light of peace.,4
2007-11-27,gwb,The day is coming when Palestinians will enjoy the blessings that freedom brings and all Israelis will enjoy the security they deserve.,5
2007-11-27,gwb,That day is coming.,2
2007-11-27,gwb,The day is coming when the terrorists and extremists who threaten the Israeli and Palestinian people will be marginalized and eventually defeated.,7
2007-11-27,gwb,"And when that day comes, future generations will look to the work we began here at Annapolis.",5
2007-11-27,gwb,"They will give thanks to the leaders who gathered on the banks of the Chesapeake for their vision, their wisdom, and courage to choose a future of freedom and peace.",8
2007-11-27,gwb,Thanks for coming.,2
2007-11-27,gwb,May God bless their work.,2
2001-10-17,gwb,Thank you all so much for that warm welcome.,3
2001-10-17,gwb,And I also want to thank the hundreds of our fellow Americans who lined the road coming in from the helicopter pad.,10
2001-10-17,gwb,It's really good to be here in California to report on our progress in the struggle against terror.,8
2001-10-17,gwb,"Now, there's the long version, and there's a short version.",3
2001-10-17,gwb,So I'm going to start with the short version: Our people are united; our Government is determined; our cause is right; and justice will be done.,5
2001-10-17,gwb,I want to thank Gerry Parsky.,3
2001-10-17,gwb,I want to thank all the folks who put on this— organized this event.,5
2001-10-17,gwb,"I appreciate so much the Governor, Gray Davis, coming, and all the elected officials.",4
2001-10-17,gwb,I particularly want to say hello to the members of the Sacramento Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 7.,7
2001-10-17,gwb,"They may not remember, but I do—I got to meet them in New York City.",6
2001-10-17,gwb,They were part of an incredible outpouring of compassion and support from all across the country.,7
2001-10-17,gwb,"I've got to tell you, I was amazed when I went into the building, and they said they were from California.",4
2001-10-17,gwb,"I said, ""This country is fabulous, when we've got people from California, from Sacramento, going all the way over to help their brothers and sisters at the World Trade Center.""",8
2001-10-17,gwb,"And I know you're just as proud of them as I am, and thank you all for being here.",4
2001-10-17,gwb,"This great State is known for its diversity, people of all races, all religions, and all nationalities.",4
2001-10-17,gwb,"They've come here to live a better life, to find freedom, to live in peace and security, with tolerance and with justice.",6
2001-10-17,gwb,"When the terrorists attacked America, this is what they attacked.",3
2001-10-17,gwb,"And when we defend America, this is what we defend.",2
2001-10-17,gwb,"We are fighting for the security of our people, for the success of our ideals, and for stability in large parts of the world.",8
2001-10-17,gwb,We fight evil people who are distorting and betraying a great religion to justify their murder.,6
2001-10-17,gwb,Our cause is just.,2
2001-10-17,gwb,We will not tire.,1
2001-10-17,gwb,"We will not falter, and my fellow Americans, we will not fail.",3
2001-10-17,gwb,"New York City and Washington, DC, are 2,500 miles from here.",3
2001-10-17,gwb,"Yet, for all of us, an American is an American, no matter where we live, no matter what our race, no matter how we pray.",5
2001-10-17,gwb,"The people of New York and Washington are our neighbors, and when terrorists attack them, they attack us all.",4
2001-10-17,gwb,And the terrorists are hearing from us all.,3
2001-10-17,gwb,"They are hearing from a compassionate nation, a nation that sends food and medicine to starving people of Afghanistan, a nation whose children—and I know we've got some here who have raised money at the elementary school—whose children are sending their dollars to save the children of Afghanistan.",11
2001-10-17,gwb,"They are hearing from a tolerant nation, a nation that respects Islam and values our many Muslim citizens.",7
2001-10-17,gwb,"They are hearing from a prayerful nation, a nation that prays to an almighty God for protection and for peace.",7
2001-10-17,gwb,"And they are hearing from a patient and determined nation, a nation that will continue this war for as long as it takes to win.",9
2001-10-17,gwb,Ours will be a broad campaign fought on many fronts.,5
2001-10-17,gwb,"It's a campaign that will be waged by day and by night, in the light and in the shadow, in battles you will see and battles you won't see.",7
2001-10-17,gwb,"It's a campaign waged by soldiers and sailors, marines and airmen, and also by FBI agents and law enforcement officials and diplomats and intelligence officers.",8
2001-10-17,gwb,It's a campaign that is being waged in distant lands and a campaign being waged by our new Office of Homeland Security.,9
2001-10-17,gwb,"To keep us safe, we're working around the clock.",3
2001-10-17,gwb,We're on the lookout.,3
2001-10-17,gwb,We have questioned and detained more than 750 terror suspects and material witnesses in our country.,4
2001-10-17,gwb,And the broad coalition we put together has detained hundreds of suspected members of the Al Qaida organization.,7
2001-10-17,gwb,Our world coalition is working.,2
2001-10-17,gwb,"We are taking apart the terrorist network, piece by piece.",4

2001-10-17,gwb,"They want us to stop flying, and they want us to stop buying.",3

2003-01-07,gwb,I like a short introduction.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,He didn't let me down.,1
2003-01-07,gwb,"For 75 years, the business leaders and the entrepreneurs in the club have helped make Chicago a prosperous and energetic city.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"You understand the concerns facing American workers and employers, and you believe, as I do, that we must address those concerns honestly and aggressively.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Today in Washington, a new Congress convenes, and I will ask members of both parties to work with me to secure our economic future.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,We cannot be satisfied until every part of our economy is healthy and vigorous.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,We will not rest until every business has a chance to grow and every person who wants to find work can find a job.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"So today I'm announcing a growth-and-jobs plan to strengthen America's economy, specific proposals to increase the momentum of our economic recovery.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,And this is a good city to give it in.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,This is one of America's great cities.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,And one of the reasons why is because you have a great mayor in Richard Daley.,8
2003-01-07,gwb,"We're from different political parties, but we have some things in common: We both married above ourselves.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,It is good to see the first lady of Chicago here.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,Thank you for coming.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,We both have famous and influential brothers.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,Our dads spent a little time in politics.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,And we love our country more than we love our political parties.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,The thing I like most about the mayor is he gets the job done for the people of Chicago.,7
2003-01-07,gwb,"And Mr. Mayor, I'm proud to call you friend.",3
2003-01-07,gwb,"And I want to thank another proud son of Chicago, Rod Blagojevich, for being with us today as well.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"He's soon to have the second-best job in America, being a Governor.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,I congratulate him on his election.,3

2003-01-07,gwb,I appreciate you being here.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,"I flew in today with the Senator from Illinois, Peter Fitzgerald.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,I appreciate his leadership.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,I appreciate his friendship.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,"And as we speak, the Senate is debating the Fitzgerald bill which will extend unemployment benefits to those who are looking for work in America.",9
2003-01-07,gwb,"And Peter, I want to thank you for your leadership on this important issue.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"And on that very same airplane was traveling with me Steve Friedman, who is the new Director of the National Economic Council.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,I'm honored that such a respected economic leader has agreed to join my administration.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,I appreciate the fact that he's willing to take time away from a comfortable private life to serve our country.,8
2003-01-07,gwb,"He is a strong addition to a great economic team, and I want to thank him for his willingness to serve America.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"Thank you for coming, Steve.",2
2003-01-07,gwb,I've also named two other good people to join this team.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,John Snow is my nominee to serve as the Secretary of Treasury.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,Bill Donaldson is my nominee to be the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,"They will fill essential positions in my administration, and I urge the Congress to confirm them quickly.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"As the new Congress meets today, our duties to this Nation are clear.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"We have a responsibility to meet great dangers to our country, wherever they gather.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,We will continue to hunt down the terrorists all across the world.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Cell by cell, we are disrupting their plans.",3
2003-01-07,gwb,"One by one, we're showing these merciless killers the meaning of justice.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,We're also confronting the outlaw regime in Iraq that lives by violence and deception and is arming to threaten the civilized world.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,"The world's demands are clear: For the sake of peace, Saddam Hussein must disarm himself of all weapons of mass destruction and prove that he has done so.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"Should he choose the other course, in the name of peace, the United States will lead a coalition of the willing to disarm the Iraqi regime of weapons of mass destruction and free the Iraqi people.",11
2003-01-07,gwb,And we're dealing with North Korea as well.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,It's a regime that has expelled international inspectors and is attempting to defy the world through its nuclear weapons program.,8
2003-01-07,gwb,The United States and other nations will confront this threat as well.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,"In this case, I believe that by working with countries in the region, diplomacy will work.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,"We have no aggressive intent, no argument with the North Korean people.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,We're interested in peace on the Korean Peninsula.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,"As we deal with the dangers of our time, different circumstances require different strategies.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,Yet our resolve in each case will be clear: We will not permit any regime to threaten the freedom and security of the American people or our allies and friends around the world.,7
2003-01-07,gwb,"Even as we confront these dangers, you need to know I know we have needs here at home, especially the need for a vigorous and growing economy.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,Too many Americans today are wondering about our economy.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,"They're asking, ""How is the economy really doing?""",3
2003-01-07,gwb,"Well, the American economy is the strongest and most resilient economy in the world.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"In spite of the terrible shocks that our Nation has received, our economy is growing, and the entrepreneurial spirit in America is strong.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,We've made great progress these past 2 years.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,"Remember, in the summer of 2000, during the Presidential campaign, the market had started on a steady decline.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,Job growth started to dwindle.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,The economy had begun to slow.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,"When I took office, the signs of recession were real.",3
2003-01-07,gwb,So I worked with the United States Congress to reduce income taxes for everyone who pays them.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"More than 100 million individuals, families, and sole proprietorships received tax relief.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"This tax relief was the largest in a generation, and it gave the economy a boost just at the right time, ensuring that the recession was one of the shortest and shallowest in modern American history.",9
2003-01-07,gwb,Americans should be able to count on those tax cuts as they plan their financial futures.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"So I will continue to press the Congress to make these tax cuts, including the end of the death tax, permanent.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,"We know that the tax cuts worked, and Americans deserve to know their tax cuts will not be taken away.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"We faced a second test with the attacks of September the 11th, 2001.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,These attacks caused terrible suffering and a massive disruption of the economy.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,Flights were canceled.,1
2003-01-07,gwb,Many hotels and stores were empty.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,Stock trading was halted for nearly a week.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,So we acted: We reopened the markets; we helped the people of New York City recover; we assisted the airlines; we provided tax incentives for business investment; and we passed terrorism insurance so building and real estate projects could go forward.,8
2003-01-07,gwb,"And then our economy was tested a third time, when Americans discovered serious abuses of trust by some corporate leaders.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"So we passed historic reforms to assure corporate integrity, to punish wrongdoers, and defend the interests of workers and investors.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"Corporate greed and malfeasance cause innocent people to lose their jobs, their savings, and often their confidence in the American system.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,"For the sake of justice, and for the sake of every honest business in America, I have made this commitment: Corporate misdeeds will be investigated; they will be prosecuted; and they will be punished.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,We have met the tests before us because the American people have worked hard through difficult times.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,And now our country has entered its second year of economic growth.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Our trade with other nations is expanding, bringing lower prices that come from imports and better jobs that come from exports.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,"More Americans are buying and building houses, a central part of the American Dream.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"The homeownership rate is now 68 percent, close to the highest ever.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,Low interest rates have allowed Americans to tap the rising value of their homes.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"In 2002, refinancings added more than $100 billion to American pocketbooks, money that helped renovate homes or pay off debt or cover tuition or purchase other goods.",9
2003-01-07,gwb,The most important indicator of our economic strength is the growing skill and efficiency of the American worker.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"The productivity of American workers went up by 5.6 percent over the last four quarters for which we have data, the best increase since 1973.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"As productivity rises, so do wages and our standard of living.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Nationwide, incomes are rising faster than inflation.",3
2003-01-07,gwb,"We have the most productive, creative, and promising economic system the world has ever seen.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,"America sets the standard for scientific research, engineering skill, and medical innovation.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,Our companies and universities attract talent from every single continent.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,Investors from around the world know America is the safest place to put their money.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,People around the world who search for a better life still dream of working and living in the United States of America.,7
2003-01-07,gwb,All these conditions create a platform for long-term growth and prosperity.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"Yet, in spite of successes, we have more work to do, because too many of our citizens who want to work cannot find a job and many employers lack the confidence to invest and create new jobs.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,We can help assure greater success tomorrow with the policies we choose today.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"Now, these policies must recognize that our $10 trillion economy is sustained by the labor and enterprise of the American people.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"Government spends a lot of money, but it doesn't build factories.",3
2003-01-07,gwb,It doesn't invest in companies or do the work that makes the economy go.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,"The role of Government is not to manage or control the economy from Washington, DC, but to remove obstacles standing in the way for faster economic growth.",9
2003-01-07,gwb,That's our role.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,And those obstacles are clear.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,"Many jobs are lost in America because Government imposes unreasonable regulations, and many jobs are lost because the lawsuit culture of this country imposes unreasonable costs.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,I will continue to press for legal and regulatory reform.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,But today—today I want to talk about these concerns: Americans carry a heavy burden of taxes and debt that could slow consumer spending.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,I'm troubled by that.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,I'm also troubled by the fact that our tax system unfairly penalizes some productive investments.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,And I worry about people who are out of work.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,"They need our help, both in short-term benefits and long-term opportunity.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"By directly confronting each of these challenges, we can preserve the hard-won gains our economy has made and advance toward greater prosperity.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"Our first challenge is to allow Americans to keep more of their money so they can spend and save and invest—the millions of individual decisions that support the market, that support business, and help create jobs.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of our economy.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,It has been the driving force of our recovery.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Yet there are warning signs I won't ignore, and I hope the Congress doesn't ignore either.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Many Americans live in constant and increasing personal debt, with credit card bills so heavy they often cannot pay much more than the monthly minimum.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"Millions of citizens spend their entire adult lives living paycheck to paycheck, never getting a chance to save for their children's education or their own retirement.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,Americans today are paying about a third of their income in taxes.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,All of this puts pressure on family budget and therefore clouds our economic future.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,Americans facing these struggles are due to receive additional tax relief in 2004 and again in 2006.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,Republicans and Democrats in Congress already approved these tax rate reductions.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"And the time to deliver the tax rate reductions is now, when they can do the most good for the American businesses.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"For the sake of economic vitality, I'm asking Congress to make all the tax rate reductions effective this year.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,The tax cuts should be retroactive to January 1st.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Upon passage, I'll order the Treasury Department to immediately adjust the amount of money withheld for income taxes, so that Americans will keep more of their paychecks right away.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,"By speeding up the income-tax cuts, we will speed economic recovery and the pace of job creation.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"If tax relief is good enough for Americans 3 years from now, it is good enough for Americans today.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,An additional beneficiary of this tax cut will be small businesses.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,About 30 million Americans include small-business income when they file their individual tax returns with the IRS.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"Faster tax relief will help these businesses to expand sooner, to hire new people faster, and to build a stronger foundation for the recovery.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,We also know that middle-income families need additional relief.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"So today I'm asking Congress to speed up three other tax reductions promised in 2001, tax reductions that will help our middle-income families.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,"Instead of slowly reducing the marriage penalty until 2009, we should do it now, to help 35 million married couples.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Instead of waiting until 2008 to move more taxpayers from the 15-percent bracket to the lowest bracket of 10 percent, we should make that change now and help 2 million working Americans.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,"And instead of gradually raising the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child by the year of 2010, for the benefit of 26 million families, we should raise it now.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,These tax reductions will bring real and immediate benefits to middle-income Americans.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Ninety-two million Americans will keep an average of $1,083 more of their own money.",7
2003-01-07,gwb,"A family of four with two earners and $39,000 in income will receive more than $1,100 in tax relief, real money to help pay the bills and push the economy forward.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"And the sooner Congress acts, the sooner the help will come.",2
2003-01-07,gwb,"Taken together, these income-tax cuts will put an additional $70 billion to work in the private economy over the next 18 months.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,And there's no better way to help our economy grow than to leave more money in the hands of the men and women who earned it.,9
2003-01-07,gwb,"Our second challenge is to encourage greater investment by individuals and small businesses, the kind of investing that builds personal wealth and helps company expand and creates new jobs.",8

2003-01-07,gwb,"One-half of American households own stock, either directly or through pension funds.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"And we have an obligation to make sure, now more than ever, that American investors are treated fairly.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,We can begin by treating investors fairly and equally in our tax laws.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"As it is now, many investments are taxed not once but twice.",3
2003-01-07,gwb,"First, the IRS taxes a company on its profit.",3
2003-01-07,gwb,Then it taxes the investors who receive the profits as dividends.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"The result of this double taxation is that for all the profit a company earns, shareholders who receive dividends keep as little as 40 cents on the dollar.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,Double taxation is bad for our economy.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,Double taxation is wrong.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,Double taxation falls especially hard on retired people.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,"About half of all dividend income goes to America's seniors, and they often rely on those checks for a steady source of income in their retirement.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,It's fair to tax a company's profits.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,It's not fair to double-tax by taxing the shareholder on the same profits.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"So today, for the good of our senior citizens and to support capital formation across the land, I'm asking the United States Congress to abolish the double taxation of dividends.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,The benefits of this tax relief will be felt throughout the economy.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"Abolishing double taxation of dividends will leave nearly 35 million Americans with more of their own money to spend and invest, which will promote savings and return as much as $20 billion this year to the private economy.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"By ending this investment penalty, we will strengthen investor confidence.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"See, by ending double taxation of dividends, we will increase the return on investing, which will draw more money into the markets to provide capital to build factories, to buy equipment, hire more people.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,We must also encourage the investments that help turn small businesses into larger ones.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,"Small businesses create the majority of new jobs in America, and they account for half the output of the economy.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"Currently, tax law permits small firms to write off as expenses up to $25,000 worth of equipment, like computers or machinery that they need.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"I'm asking the Congress to raise that limit to $75,000 and index that number for inflation.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"This change, together with the faster rate reductions, will benefit more than 23 million small-business owners.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,My view is this economy can thrive only if our small businesses thrive.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,And we will provide them every incentive to grow and create more jobs.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,A third challenge facing our country is the need to help unemployed workers and prepare them for the new jobs of a growing economy.,8
2003-01-07,gwb,The unemployment rate today is 6 percent.,2
2003-01-07,gwb,That's low for an economy coming out of recession.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,"It's higher than it should be, and the unemployment rate is projected to rise even further in the short run.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,This hardship is concentrated in certain regions and in certain industries.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,Manufacturing jobs have declined for 28 months in a row.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,You know what I'm talking about here in the Midwest.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,You're showing signs of recovery here; yet many people here and across this country are still looking for work.,4
2003-01-07,gwb,A woman in Arkansas tells a typical story.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,She talked about the fact that her husband was laid off from his job at a local steel mill.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,And both she and the husband have been looking for a job for quite a while.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,"Here's what she said: ""There's just nothing for me to find.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,"We're trying to save up what little money we have and move to another community and look for jobs there.""",7
2003-01-07,gwb,Got to be worried about those kind of stories here in America.,7

2003-01-07,gwb,"Close to 70,000 workers each week exhaust their unemployment benefits, and we have an obligation to help our fellow citizens.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,So I'm asking this new Congress to extend unemployment benefits that expired on December the 28th.,7
2003-01-07,gwb,"And the benefits Congress approves should be retroactive, like the Fitzgerald bill, so that people who lost their benefits last month can receive their benefits in full.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"Helping America's unemployed workers should be a first order of business in the new Congress, and it looks like it's going to be.",4
2003-01-07,gwb,We must be more creative when we help those who have the hardest time finding work.,6
2003-01-07,gwb,"To encourage innovation and more choices and to help those who are out of work find the dignity of a new job, today I'm unveiling a new approach to helping unemployed Americans through Personal Reemployment Accounts.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,"Under this new program, Americans who face the greatest difficulties in finding work will receive up to $3,000 to use in their job search.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,They will have great flexibility in how they use that money.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,A person with a Reemployment Account will be able to decide whether to use the funds for job training or child care or transportation or even to cover the costs of relocating to another city for a new job.,10
2003-01-07,gwb,"If the job is obtained quickly— within 13 weeks—the worker will be able to keep the cash balance as a ""reemployment bonus.""",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"As we see new economic growth, we will need well-trained workers to fill new jobs.",3
2003-01-07,gwb,"So I'm going to ask the Congress to provide $3.6 billion to the States to pay for the Reemployment Accounts, enough money to help more than a million unemployed men and women across America.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"In order to strengthen this economy in the future, we must help these Americans today.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"The jobs-and-growth proposals I've outlined today are a focused plan to encourage consumer spending, to promote small-business growth, to boost confidence in our markets, and to give critical help to unemployed citizens.",8
2003-01-07,gwb,"Overall, this growth package will reduce the tax burden of Americans by $98 billion this year and $670 billion over the next decade.",3
2003-01-07,gwb,"I proposed a bold plan because the need for this plan is urgent, and I urge the Congress to act swiftly and pass this bill.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,Our Nation has seen 2 years of serious and steady challenges.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,The recession and the decline in the stock market slowed earnings and cut into tax revenues and created a budget deficit.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"And in this time of war, I can assure you this Government is spending what is necessary to win the war.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"But the Congress must also understand this: The American people deserve and expect spending discipline in Washington, DC.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,"With spending discipline and with progrowth policies, we will expand the economy and help bring down this deficit.",5
2003-01-07,gwb,This growth-and-jobs package is essential in the short run; it's an immediate boost to the economy.,5
2003-01-07,gwb,"And these proposals will help stimulate investment and put more people back to work, is what we want to have happen.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"They are essential for the long run as well, to lay the groundwork for future growth and future prosperity.",6
2003-01-07,gwb,"That growth will bring the added benefit of higher revenues for the Government, revenues that will keep tax rates low while fulfilling key obligations and protecting programs such as Medicare and Social Security.",10
2003-01-07,gwb,We're meeting the challenges to America.,3
2003-01-07,gwb,"We're strengthening our economy, and we're taking a battle to our enemies.",4

2008-01-18,gwb,"In recent months, we've taken steps to shore up the housing market, including measures to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and to keep their homes.",8
2008-01-18,gwb,I've also—have asked Congress to pass legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration and enable it to provide additional assistance to struggling homeowners.,9
2008-01-18,gwb,"The House passed a bill, and the Senate passed a bill, and now they need to get together and get a bill to my desk as quickly as possible.",7
2008-01-18,gwb,"After careful consideration and after discussions with Members of the Congress, I have concluded that additional action is needed.",7
2008-01-18,gwb,"To keep our economy growing and creating jobs, Congress and the administration need to work to enact an economic growth package as soon as possible.",5
2008-01-18,gwb,"As Congress considers such a plan, there are certain principles that must guide its deliberations.",4
2008-01-18,gwb,"This growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours, which means it should be about 1 percent of GDP.",8
2008-01-18,gwb,This growth package must be built on broad-based tax relief that will directly affect economic growth and not the kind of spending projects that would have little immediate impact on our economy.,10
2008-01-18,gwb,This growth package must be temporary and take effect right away so we can get help to our economy when it needs it most.,5
2008-01-18,gwb,And this growth package must not include any tax increases.,2
2008-01-18,gwb,"Specifically, this growth package should bolster both business investment and consumer spending, which are critical to economic growth.",6
2008-01-18,gwb,And this would require two key provisions.,2
2008-01-18,gwb,"To be effective, a growth package must include tax incentive for American businesses, including small businesses, to make major investments in their enterprises this year.",6
2008-01-18,gwb,"Giving them an incentive to invest now will encourage businessowners to expand their operations, create new jobs, and inject new energy into our economy in the process.",5
2008-01-18,gwb,"To be effective, a growth package must also include direct and rapid income tax relief for the American people.",4
2008-01-18,gwb,"Americans could use this money as they see fit: to help meet their monthly bills, cover higher costs at the gas pump, or pay for other basic necessities.",6
2008-01-18,gwb,Letting Americans keep more of their own money should increase consumer spending and lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less.,6
2008-01-18,gwb,Yesterday I spoke to members of the congressional leadership from both political parties.,5
2008-01-18,gwb,"They shared with me their thoughts on the best way forward, and I was encouraged by those discussions.",4
2008-01-18,gwb,And I believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support.,9
2008-01-18,gwb,I've asked Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to lead my administration's efforts to forge an agreement with Congress so that we can deliver this needed boost to our economy as quickly as possible.,7
2008-01-18,gwb,Passing a new growth package is our most pressing economic priority.,3
2008-01-18,gwb,"When that is done, Congress must turn to the most important economic priority for our country, and that's making sure the tax relief that is now in place is not taken away.",7
2008-01-18,gwb,A source of uncertainty in our economy is that this tax relief is set to expire at the end of 2010.,6
2008-01-18,gwb,"Unless Congress acts, the American people will face massive tax increases in less than 3 years.",5
2008-01-18,gwb,"The marriage penalty will make a comeback, the child tax credit will be cut in half, the death tax will come back to life, and tax rates will go up on regular income, capital gains, and dividends.",5
2008-01-18,gwb,"This tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk, and Congress has a responsibility to keep that from happening.",5
2008-01-18,gwb,So it's critical that Congress make this tax relief permanent.,4
2008-01-18,gwb,"We're in the midst of a challenging period, and I know that Americans are concerned about their economic future.",6
2008-01-18,gwb,"But our economy has seen challenging times before, and it is resilient.",2
2008-01-18,gwb,"In a vibrant economy, markets rise and decline.",3
2008-01-18,gwb,We cannot change that fundamental dynamic.,2
2008-01-18,gwb,"As a matter of fact, eliminating risk altogether would also eliminate the innovation and productivity that drives the creations of jobs and wealth in America.",6
2008-01-18,gwb,Yet there are also times when swift and temporary actions can help ensure that inevitable market adjustments do not undermine the health of the broader economy.,8
2008-01-18,gwb,This is such a moment.,2
2008-01-18,gwb,"By passing an effective growth package quickly, we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy.",4
2008-01-18,gwb,"And it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of our economy.",8
2008-01-18,gwb,"I'm optimistic about our economic future because Americans have shown time and again that they are the most industrious, creative, and enterprising people in the world.",8
2008-01-18,gwb,"That is what has made our economy strong, and that is what will make it stronger in the challenging times ahead.",6

2007-09-17,gwb,I'm pleased to announce my nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the 81st Attorney General of the United States.,8
2007-09-17,gwb,"Judge, thank you for agreeing to serve.",4
2007-09-17,gwb,The Attorney General serves as our Nation's chief law enforcement officer.,4
2007-09-17,gwb,"The Attorney General has an especially vital role to play in a time of war, and when we face the challenges—and we face the challenge of protecting our people on a dailybasis from deadly enemies, while at the same time protecting our freedom.",10
2007-09-17,gwb,Judge Mukasey brings impressive credentials to this task.,3
2007-09-17,gwb,"In 1987, he was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York.",7
2007-09-17,gwb,It's one of the country's busiest and most respected trial courts.,6
2007-09-17,gwb,"He sat on that court for more than 18 years, and he earned the reputation as a tough, but fair judge.",5
2007-09-17,gwb,"For 6 of those years, he was the chief judge, and he was a sound manager and a strong leader.",5
2007-09-17,gwb,"Throughout his time on the bench, Judge Mukasey was widely admired for his brilliance and his integrity.",5
2007-09-17,gwb,"Mike has experience in the Justice Department and private practice, as well as having served on the bench.",5
2007-09-17,gwb,"He served 4 years as an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, where he tried many cases and he developed expertise in the workings of the criminal justice system.",7
2007-09-17,gwb,"He's also worked as a partner in a law firm, and he holds degrees from Columbia University and Yale Law School.",6
2007-09-17,gwb,Some of Judge Mukasey's most important legal experience is in the area of national security.,5
2007-09-17,gwb,"Judge Mukasey presided over the trial of the terrorist known as ""the Blind Sheikh"" and his codefendants in the conspiracy to destroy prominent New York City landmarks, including bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.",17
2007-09-17,gwb,"Before the 9/11 attacks, this was one of the most important terrorism cases in our Nation's history, and the verdict in that case was affirmed on appeal.",7
2007-09-17,gwb,"In affirming the convictions, the appeals court signaled out the judge for praise.",4
2007-09-17,gwb,I found it very interesting of—what they said.,4
2007-09-17,gwb,"Here's what they wrote: ""The Honorable Michael B. Mukasey presided with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant, and helpfulness to the jury.",7
2007-09-17,gwb,"His was an outstanding achievement in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured by a trial judge.""",11
2007-09-17,gwb,"When the World Trade Center was attacked again, Judge Mukasey quickly reopened his court, even though it was just blocks from Ground Zero.",5
2007-09-17,gwb,He recognized the importance of maintaining a functioning justice system in the midst of a national emergency.,8
2007-09-17,gwb,"He and other judges in his district worked day and night to ensure that applications for warrants were processed, investigations could proceed, and the rule of law was upheld.",5
2007-09-17,gwb,Judge Mukasey is clear eyed about the threat our Nation faces.,6
2007-09-17,gwb,"As a judge and a private lawyer, he's written on matters of constitutional law and national security.",6
2007-09-17,gwb,"He knows what it takes to fight this war effectively, and he knows how to do it in a manner that is consistent with our laws and our Constitution.",10
2007-09-17,gwb,"And when confirmed by the Senate as Attorney General, he will work to ensure that our law enforcement and intelligence officers have the tools they need to protect the United States and our citizens.",8
2007-09-17,gwb,"When he takes his place at the Department of Justice, he will succeed another fine judge, Alberto Gonzales.",5
2007-09-17,gwb,"From his days as a supreme court justice in Texas to his years as White House Counsel and as Attorney General of the United States, this honorable and decent man has served with distinction.",6
2007-09-17,gwb,I've known Al and his family for more than a decade.,4

2007-09-17,gwb,"I'm going to miss him, and I wish Al and Becky all the best.",3
2007-09-17,gwb,"With Mike Mukasey, the Justice Department will be in the hands of a great lawyer and an accomplished public servant.",6
2007-09-17,gwb,Mike has shown good judgment in the courtroom; he's shown good judgment outside the courtroom.,4
2007-09-17,gwb,"After all, he married a teacher.",2
2007-09-17,gwb,"And we welcome Susan here, as well as son Marc and daughter Jessica.",3
2007-09-17,gwb,Thank you all for coming.,2
2007-09-17,gwb,He's also brought his sister Rhoda and brother-in-law Norm.,5
2007-09-17,gwb,I want to thank you all for supporting Mike as he takes on this important responsibility for our country.,8
2007-09-17,gwb,"It's a pivotal time for our Nation, and it's vital that the position of Attorney General be filled quickly.",6
2007-09-17,gwb,I urge the Senate to confirm Judge Mukasey promptly.,3
2007-09-17,gwb,"Until the judge is confirmed, Assistant Attorney General Paul Keisler will serve as Acting Attorney General.",3
2007-09-17,gwb,Accepting this assignment requires Peter—I said Peter—Peter Keisler.,4
2007-09-17,gwb,"Accepting this assignment requires Peter to delay the departure date he announced earlier this month, and I appreciate his willingness to do so.",5
2007-09-17,gwb,Peter is the Acting Attorney General.,2
2007-09-17,gwb,"Paul Clement, who agreed to take on this role, will remain focused on his duties as Solicitor General, so he can prepare for the Supreme Court term that begins just 2 weeks from today.",7
2007-09-17,gwb,"Judge, I'm grateful for answering our Nation's call to serve.",6
2007-09-17,gwb,I look forward to welcome you as the next Attorney General of the United States.,6

2007-04-16,gwb,I've spoken with Governor Tim Kaine and Virginia Tech President Charles Steger.,5
2007-04-16,gwb,I told them that Laura and I and many across our Nation are praying for the victims and their families and all the members of the university community who have been devastated by this terrible tragedy.,8
2007-04-16,gwb,"I told them that my administration would do everything possible to assist with the investigation, and that I pledged that we would stand ready to help local law enforcement and the local community in any way we can during this time of sorrow.",9

2007-04-16,gwb,"When that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom and every American community.",4

2008-12-19,gwb,"For years, America's automakers have faced serious challenges: burdensome costs, a shrinking share of the market, and declining profits.",6
2008-12-19,gwb,"In recent months, the global financial crisis has made these challenges even more severe.",3
2008-12-19,gwb,Now some U.S. auto executives say that their companies are nearing collapse and that the only way they can buy time to restructure is with help from the Federal Government.,7
2008-12-19,gwb,This is a difficult situation that involves fundamental questions about the proper role of Government.,7
2008-12-19,gwb,"On the one hand, Government has a responsibility not to undermine the private enterprise system.",4
2008-12-19,gwb,"On the other hand, Government has a responsibility to safeguard the broader health and stability of our economy.",6
2008-12-19,gwb,Addressing the challenges in the auto industry requires us to balance these two responsibilities.,5
2008-12-19,gwb,"If we were to allow the free market to take its course now, it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers.",5
2008-12-19,gwb,"Under ordinary economic circumstances, I would say this is the price that failed companies must pay, and I would not favor intervening to prevent the automakers from going out of business.",8
2008-12-19,gwb,But these are not ordinary circumstances.,2
2008-12-19,gwb,"In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession, allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action.",6
2008-12-19,gwb,The question is how we can best give it a chance to succeed.,4
2008-12-19,gwb,Some argue the wisest pass—wisest path is to allow the auto companies to reorganize through chapter 11 provisions of our bankruptcy laws and provide Federal loans to keep them operating while they try to restructure under the supervision of a bankruptcy court.,11
2008-12-19,gwb,"But given the current state of the auto industry and the economy, chapter 11 is unlikely to work for American auto-makers at this time.",6
2008-12-19,gwb,"American consumers understand why: If you hear that a car company is suddenly going into bankruptcy, you worry that parts and servicing will not be available, and you question the value of your warranty.",6
2008-12-19,gwb,"And with consumers hesitant to buy new cars from struggling automakers, it would be more difficult for auto companies to recover.",5
2008-12-19,gwb,"Additionally, the financial cross—crisis brought the auto companies to the brink of bankruptcy much faster than they could have anticipated.",4
2008-12-19,gwb,And they have not made the legal and financial preparations necessary to carry out an orderly bankruptcy proceeding that could lead to a successful restructuring.,7
2008-12-19,gwb,The convergence of these factors means there is too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly liquidation of American auto companies.,8
2008-12-19,gwb,My economic advisers believe that such a collapse would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworking Americans far beyond the auto industry.,5
2008-12-19,gwb,It would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis.,3
2008-12-19,gwb,"It could send our suffering economy into a deeper and longer recession, and it would leave the next President to confront the demise of a major American industry in his first days of office.",6
2008-12-19,gwb,A more responsible option is to give the auto companies an incentive to restructure outside of bankruptcy and a brief window in which to do it.,6
2008-12-19,gwb,And that is why my administration worked with Congress on a bill to provide automakers with loans to stave off bankruptcy while they develop plans for viability.,11
2008-12-19,gwb,This legislation earned bipartisan support from majorities in both Houses of Congress.,7
2008-12-19,gwb,"Unfortunately, despite extensive debate and agreement that we should prevent disorderly bankruptcies in the American auto industry, Congress was unable to get a bill to my desk before adjourning this year.",6
2008-12-19,gwb,This means the only way to avoid a collapse of the U.S. auto industry is for the executive branch to step in.,7
2008-12-19,gwb,"The American people want the auto companies to succeed, and so do I.",3
2008-12-19,gwb,So today I'm announcing that the Federal Government will grant loans to auto companies under conditions similar to those Congress considered last week.,9
2008-12-19,gwb,These loans will provide help in two ways.,3
2008-12-19,gwb,"First, they will give automakers 3 months to put in place plans to restructure into viable companies, which we believe they are capable of doing.",11
2008-12-19,gwb,"Second, if restructuring cannot be accomplished outside of bankruptcy, the loans will provide time for companies to make the legal and financial preparations necessary for an orderly chapter 11 process that offers a better prospect of long-term success and gives consumers confidence that they can continue to buy American cars.",10
2008-12-19,gwb,"Because Congress failed to make funds available for these loans, the plan I am announcing today will be drawn from the financial rescue package Congress approved earlier this fall.",6
2008-12-19,gwb,The terms of the loans will require auto companies to demonstrate how they would become viable.,4
2008-12-19,gwb,They must pay back all their loans to the Government and show that their firms can earn a profit and achieve a positive net worth.,5
2008-12-19,gwb,"This restructuring will require meaningful concessions from all involved in the auto industry: management, labor unions, creditors, bondholders, dealers, and suppliers.",7
2008-12-19,gwb,"In particular, automakers must meet conditions that experts agree are necessary for long-term viability, including putting their retirement plans on a sustainable footing, persuading bondholders to convert their debt into capital the companies need to address immediate financial shortfalls, and making their compensation competitive with foreign automakers who have major operations in the United States.",10
2008-12-19,gwb,"If a company fails to come up with a viable plan by March 31, it will be required to repay its Federal loans.",5
2008-12-19,gwb,The automakers and unions must understand what is at stake and make hard decisions necessary to reform.,5
2008-12-19,gwb,"These conditions send a clear message to everyone involved in the future of American automakers: The time to make the hard decisions to become viable is now, or the only option will be bankruptcy.",9
2008-12-19,gwb,The actions I'm announcing today represent a step that we wish were not necessary.,4
2008-12-19,gwb,"But given the situation, it is the most effective and responsible way to address this challenge facing our Nation.",6
2008-12-19,gwb,"By giving the auto companies a chance to restructure, we will shield the American people from a harsh economic blow at a vulnerable time.",5
2008-12-19,gwb,And we will give American workers an opportunity to show the world once again they can meet challenges with ingenuity and determination and bounce back from tough times and emerge stronger than before.,7

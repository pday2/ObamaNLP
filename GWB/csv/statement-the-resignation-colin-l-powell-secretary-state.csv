"Colin Powell is one of the great public servants of our time. He is a soldier, a diplomat, a civic leader, a statesman, and a great patriot. I value his friendship. He will be missed. On behalf of all Americans, I thank him for his many years of service, and I wish him and Alma all the best."
"In his 4 years as Secretary of State, Colin forged new alliances that are helping America win the war on terror and reinvigorated old and honored friendships. He has helped to build two great coalitions that have liberated more than 50 million people in Afghanistan and Iraq from brutal dictators and which are now helping those nations emerge as successful democracies. He was a key architect of the Broader Middle East Initiative, which is helping to spread freedom and democracy in that region."
"His diplomatic skills also helped to end regional conflicts and lower tensions on the Indian subcontinent. Through his advocacy, he focused the world's attention on the plight of the suffering in Sudan, Liberia, and Haiti. His role in resolving the EP- 3 incident early in my administration showed the calm judgment and steady resolve he has brought to our foreign policy. Thousands of dedicated foreign policy professionals are grateful for his leadership in modernizing and strengthening the Department of State."
